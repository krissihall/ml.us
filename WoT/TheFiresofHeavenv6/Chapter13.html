<h4><em>A Small Room in Sienda</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>layne
held herself against the swaying of the coach
on its leather hinges, trying to ignore Nynaeve&rsquo;s sour face across
from her. The curtains were drawn back despite a sprinkling of dust
that sometimes whipped through the windows; the breeze blew away
some of the late-afternoon heat. Rolling, forested hills streamed
past, the woods occasionally broken by short stretches of farmland.
A lord&rsquo;s manor, in the fashion of Amadicia, topped one of the hills
a few miles from the road, a huge stone foundation fifty feet high
with an elaborate wooden structure atop that, all ornate balconies
and red-tiled roofs. Once it all would have been stone, but many
years had passed since a lord needed a fortress in Amadicia, and
the king&rsquo;s law now required the wooden construction. No rebel lord
would be able to hold out against the king for long. Of course, the
Children of the Light were exempted from that law; they were immune
to a number of Amadician laws. She had had to learn something of
the laws and customs of other countries from the time she was a
child.</p>

<p>Cleared fields dotted the distant hills, too, like
brown patches on a mostly green cloth, the men working them seeming
ants. Everything looked dry; one bolt of lightning would set a fire
that could burn for leagues. But lightning meant rain, and the few
clouds in the sky were too high and thin for that. Idly she
wondered whether she could make it rain. She had learned
considerable control over weather. Still, it was very difficult if
you had to begin with nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is my Lady bored?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked acidly. &ldquo;The way my
Lady is staring at the countryside&mdash;down my Lady&rsquo;s nose&mdash;I think my Lady must want to travel faster.&rdquo; Reaching back
over her head, she pushed open a small flap and shouted, &ldquo;More
speed, Thom. Don&rsquo;t argue with me! You hold your tongue, too, Juilin
Thief-catcher! I said more speed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wooden flap banged down, but Elayne could still
hear Thom muttering loudly. Cursing, very likely; Nynaeve had been
barking at the men all day. A moment later his whip cracked, and
the coach racketed ahead even faster, rocking so hard that both
women bounced on the golden-colored silk seats. The silk had been
thoroughly dusted when Thom bought the vehicle, but the padding had
long since gone hard. Yet jounced about as she was, the set of
Nynaeve&rsquo;s jaw said she would not ask Thom to slow again right after
ordering him to go faster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Nynaeve,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; The other
woman cut her off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is my Lady uncomfortable? I know ladies are used to
comfort, the sort of thing a poor maid wouldn&rsquo;t know about, but
surely my Lady wants to make the next town before dark? So my
Lady&rsquo;s maid can serve my Lady&rsquo;s supper and turn down my Lady&rsquo;s
bed?&rdquo; Her teeth clicked shut as the seat coming up met her coming
down, and she glowered at Elayne as though it were her fault.</p>

<p>Elayne sighed heavily. Nynaeve had seen the point,
back in Mardecin. A lady never traveled without a maid, and two
ladies would probably have a pair. Unless they put Thom or Juilin
in a dress, that meant one of them. Nynaeve <em>had</em> seen that
Elayne knew more of how ladies behaved; she had put it very gently,
and Nynaeve usually knew sense when she heard it. Usually. But that
was back in Mistress Macura&rsquo;s shop, after they had filled the two
women with their own horrible concoction.</p>

<p>Leaving Mardecin, they had traveled hard until
midnight to reach a small village with an inn, where they had
roused the innkeeper from his bed to rent two cramped rooms with
narrow beds, waking before first light yesterday to push on,
skirting around Amador by a few miles. Neither of them would be
taken for anything but what they claimed, on sight, but neither
felt comfortable about passing through a great city full of
Whitecloaks. The Fortress of the Light was in Amador. Elayne had
heard it said that the king reigned in Amador, but Pedron Niall
ruled.</p>

<p>The trouble had started last night, at a place called
Bellon, on a muddy stream grandly named the Gaean River, some
twenty miles or so beyond the capital. The Bellon Ford Inn was
larger than the first, and Mistress Alfara, the innkeeper, offered
the Lady Morelin a private dining room, which Elayne could not very
well refuse. Mistress Alfara had been sure that only the Lady
Morelin&rsquo;s maid, Nana, would know how to serve her properly; ladies
did require everything just so, the woman said, as well they
should, and her girls were simply not used to ladies. Nana would
know exactly how the Lady Morelin wanted her bed turned down, and
would prepare her a nice bath after a hot day of travel. The list
of things that Nana would do exactly right for her mistress had
been endless.</p>

<p>Elayne was not sure whether Amadician nobility
expected such or Mistress Alfara was just getting work out of an
outlander&rsquo;s servant. She had tried to spare Nynaeve, but the woman
had been as full of &ldquo;as you wish&rdquo; and &ldquo;my Lady is most particular&rdquo;
as the innkeeper. She would have seemed a fool, or at least odd, to
press it. They were trying to avoid attracting undue attention.</p>

<p>As long as they had been in Bellon, Nynaeve had acted
the perfect lady&rsquo;s maid in public. In private was another matter.
Elayne wished the woman would just revert to herself instead of
bludgeoning her with a lady&rsquo;s maid from the Blight. Apologies had
been met with &ldquo;my Lady is too kind&rdquo; or simply ignored. <em>I will
not apologize again</em>, she thought for the fiftieth time.
<em>Not for what was not my fault</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking, Nynaeve.&rdquo; Gripping a hanging
strap, she felt like the ball in the children&rsquo;s game called Bounce
in Andor, where you tried to keep a colorful wooden ball bouncing
up and down on a paddle. She would not ask for the coach to be
slowed, though. She could stand it as long as Nynaeve did. The
woman was so stubborn! &ldquo;I want to reach Tar Valon and find out what
is going on, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lady has been thinking? My Lady must have a
headache from all that effort. I will make my Lady a nice tea of
sheepstongue root and red daisy as soon as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Nana,&rdquo; Elayne said, calmly but firmly; it
was her very best imitation of her mother. Nynaeve&rsquo;s jaw dropped.
&ldquo;If you pull that braid at me, you can ride on the roof with the
baggage.&rdquo; Nynaeve made a strangled sound, trying so hard to talk
that nothing came out. Quite satisfactory. &ldquo;Sometimes you seem to
think I am still a child, but you are the one behaving like a
child. I did not ask you to wash my back, but I would have had to
wrestle to stop you. I did offer to scrub yours in turn, remember.
And I offered to sleep in the trundle bed. But you climbed in and
wouldn&rsquo;t get out. Stop sulking. If you like, I will be the maid at
the next inn.&rdquo; It would probably be a disaster. Nynaeve would shout
at Thom in public, or box someone&rsquo;s ears. But anything for a little
peace. &ldquo;We can stop right now and change in the trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We chose the gowns to fit you,&rdquo; the other woman
muttered after a moment. Pushing the flap open again, she shouted,
&ldquo;Slow down! Are you trying to kill us? Fool men!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was dead silence from above as the coach&rsquo;s
speed diminished to something much more reasonable, but Elayne
would have wagered the two men were talking. She straightened her
hair as best she could without a mirror. It was still startling to
see those glistening black tresses when she did look in one. The
green silk was going to need a thorough brushing itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it you were thinking, Elayne?&rdquo; Nynaeve
asked. Crimson stained her cheeks. At least she knew that Elayne
was right, but backing down was very likely as much apology as she
would ever give.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are rushing back to Tar Valon, but do we really
have any idea what awaits us in the Tower? If the Amyrlin truly did
give those orders&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I do not really believe it, and I cannot
understand it, but I do not intend to walk into the Tower until I
do. &lsquo;A fool puts her hand into a hollow tree without finding out
what&rsquo;s inside first.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wise woman, Lini,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;We may learn
more if I see another bunch of yellow flowers hanging upside down,
but until then I think we should behave as though the Black Ajah
itself has control of the Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistress Macura will have sent off another pigeon to
Narenwin by now. With descriptions of this coach, and the dresses
we took, and most likely Thom and Juilin, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It cannot be helped. This would not have happened if
we hadn&rsquo;t dawdled across Tarabon. We should have taken ship.&rdquo;
Elayne gaped at her accusatory tone, and Nynaeve had the grace to
blush again. &ldquo;Well, done is done. Moiraine knows Siuan Sanche.
Perhaps Egwene can ask her if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly the coach lurched to a halt, throwing Elayne
forward on top of Nynaeve. She could hear horses screaming and
thrashing as she frantically untangled herself, Nynaeve pushing her
off as well.</p>

<p>Embracing <em>saidar</em>, she put her head out of
the window&mdash;and released it again in relief. Here was
something of a sort that she had seen pass through Caemlyn more
than once. A traveling menagerie was camped amid afternoon shadows
in a large clearing by the side of the road. A great, black-maned
lion lay half-asleep in one cage that took up the entire back of a
wagon, while his two consorts paced in the confines of another. A
third cage stood open; in front of it a woman was making two black
bears with white faces balance themselves on big red balls. Another
cage held what appeared to be a large, hairy boar, except that its
snout was too pointed and it had toes with claws; that came from
the Aiel Waste, she knew, and was called a <em>capar</em>. Other
cages held other animals, and brightly colored birds, but unlike
any menagerie she had ever seen, this one traveled with human
performers: two men were juggling ribbon-twined hoops between them,
four acrobats were practicing standing on one another&rsquo;s shoulders
in a tall column, and a woman was feeding a dozen dogs that walked
on their hind legs and did backflips for her. In the background,
some other men were putting up two tall poles; she had no idea what
they were for.</p>

<p>None of that was what had the horses rearing in their
harness and rolling their eyes, though, despite all that Thom could
do with the reins. She could smell the lions herself, but it was at
three huge, wrinkled gray animals that the horses gazed, wild-eyed.
Two were as tall as the coach, with big ears and great curving
tusks beside a long nose that dangled to the ground. The third,
shorter than the horses if likely as heavy, had no tusks. A baby,
she supposed. A woman with pale yellow hair was scratching that one
behind the ear with a heavy, hooked goad. Elayne had seen creatures
like this before, too. And had never expected to see them
again.</p>

<p>A tall, dark-haired man strode out of the camp, of
all things in this heat wearing a red silk cloak that he flourished
as he made an elegant bow. He was good-looking, with a well-turned
leg, and very much aware of both things. &ldquo;Forgive me, my Lady, if
the giant boar-horses frightened your animals.&rdquo; As he straightened,
he beckoned two of his men to help quiet the horses, then paused,
staring at her, and murmured, &ldquo;Be still, my heart.&rdquo; It was just
loud enough for Elayne to be sure she was supposed to hear. &ldquo;I am
Valan Luca, my Lady, showman extraordinary. Your presence
overwhelms me.&rdquo; He made another bow, even more elaborate than the
first.</p>

<p>Elayne shared a look with Nynaeve, catching the same
amused smile that she knew she herself wore. A man very full of
himself, this Valan Luca. His men did seem to be very good at
soothing the horses; they still snorted and stamped, but their eyes
were not so wide as they had been. Thom and Juilin were staring at
the strange animals almost as hard as the horses were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boar-horses, Master Luca?&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;Where do
they come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Giant</em> boar-horses, my Lady,&rdquo; was the ready
reply, &ldquo;from fabled Shara, where I myself led an expedition into a
wilderness full of strange civilizations and stranger sights to
trap them. It would fascinate me to tell you of them. Gigantic
people twice the size of Ogier.&rdquo; He made grand gestures to
illustrate. &ldquo;Beings with no heads. Birds big enough to carry off a
full-grown bull. Snakes that can swallow a man. Cities made of
solid gold. Descend, my Lady, and let me tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne had no doubt that Luca would fascinate himself
with his own tales, but she certainly doubted that those animals
came from Shara. For one thing, even the Sea Folk saw no more of
Shara than the walled ports they were confined to; any who went
beyond the walls were never seen again. The Aiel knew little more.
For another, she and Nynaeve had both seen creatures like these in
Falme, during the Seanchan invasion. The Seanchan used them for
work animals, and for war.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not, Master Luca,&rdquo; she told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let us perform for you,&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;As
you can see, this is no ordinary wandering menagerie, but something
entirely new. A private performance. Tumblers, jugglers, trained
animals, the strongest man in the world. Even fireworks. We have an
Illuminator with us. We are on our way to Ghealdan, and tomorrow we
will be gone on the wind. But for a pittance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mistress said she thinks not,&rdquo; Nynaeve broke in.
&ldquo;She has better things to spend her money on than looking at
animals.&rdquo; In fact, she herself kept a tight fist on all their coin,
reluctantly doling out what they needed. She seemed to think
everything should cost what it had back in her Two Rivers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why would you want to go to Ghealdan, Master Luca?&rdquo;
Elayne asked. The other woman did make rough spots and leave them
to her to smooth over. &ldquo;I hear there is a great deal of trouble
there. I hear the army has not been able to suppress this man
called the Prophet, with his preaching of the Dragon Reborn. Surely
you do not want to travel into riots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Greatly exaggerated, my Lady. Greatly exaggerated.
Where there are crowds, people want to be entertained. And where
people want to be entertained, my show is always welcome.&rdquo; Luca
hesitated, then stepped closer to the coach. An embarrassed look
crossed his face as he gazed up into Elayne&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;My Lady, the
truth of the matter is that you would do me a very great favor by
allowing me to perform for you. The fact is that one of the
boar-horses caused a little trouble in the next town up the road.
It was an accident,&rdquo; he added hastily, &ldquo;I assure you. They are
gentle creatures. Not dangerous at all. But not only are the people
of Sienda unwilling to let me put on a show, or even come to one
here&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, it took all of my coin to pay for the damages, and
the fines.&rdquo; He winced. &ldquo;Especially the fines. If you allowed me to
entertain you&mdash;for a trifle, truly&mdash;I would name you as
patroness of my show wherever we go across the world, spreading the
fame of your generosity, my Lady&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morelin,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The Lady Morelin of House
Samared.&rdquo; With her new hair, she could pass for Cairhienin. She had
no time to see his show, as much as she would have enjoyed it
another time, and she told him so, adding, &ldquo;But I will help you a
little, if you have no money. Give him something, Nana, to help him
on his way to Ghealdan.&rdquo; The last thing she wanted was him
&ldquo;spreading her fame,&rdquo; but helping the poor and those in distress
was a duty she would not slight when she had the means, even in a
foreign land.</p>

<p>Grumbling, Nynaeve dug a purse out of her belt pouch
and dipped into it. She leaned out of the coach enough to press
Luca&rsquo;s hand around what she gave him. He looked startled as she
said, &ldquo;If you took a decent job of work, you would not have to beg.
Drive on, Thom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom&rsquo;s whip cracked, and Elayne was thrown back into
her seat. &ldquo;You did not have to be rude,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Or so abrupt.
What did you give him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A silver penny,&rdquo; Nynaeve replied calmly, putting the
purse back into her pouch. &ldquo;And more than he deserved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve,&rdquo; Elayne groaned. &ldquo;The man probably thinks
we were making sport of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve sniffed. &ldquo;With those shoulders, a good day&rsquo;s
work would not kill him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne kept silent, though she did not agree. Not
exactly. Certainly work would not harm the man, but she did not
think there was much available. <em>Not that I think Master Luca
would accept work that didn&rsquo;t allow him to wear that cape</em>. If
she brought it up, though, Nynaeve would probably argue&mdash;when
she gently pointed out things that Nynaeve did not know, the woman
was quite capable of accusing her of having an arrogant manner, or
of lecturing&mdash;and Valan Luca was hardly worth another
altercation so soon after smoothing over the last.</p>

<p>The shadows were lengthening by the time they reached
Sienda, a sizable village of stone and thatch with two inns. The
first, The King&rsquo;s Lancer, had a gaping hole where the front door
had been, and a crowd was watching workmen make repairs. Perhaps
Master Luca&rsquo;s &ldquo;boar-horse&rdquo; had not liked the sign, propped up
beside the hole now, a charging soldier with lance lowered. It
seemed to have been ripped down somehow.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, there were even more Whitecloaks in the
crowded dirt streets than back in Mardecin, far more, and other
soldiers besides, men in mail and conical steel caps whose blue
cloaks bore the Star and Thistle of Amadicia. There must be
garrisons nearby. The King&rsquo;s men and the Whitecloaks did not seem
to like each other at all. They either brushed by as if the man
wearing the wrong color did not exist, or else with challenging
stares little short of drawn swords. Some of the white-cloaked men
had red shepherd&rsquo;s crooks behind the sunbursts on their cloaks. The
Hand of the Light, those named themselves, the Hand that seeks out
truth, but everyone else called them Questioners. Even the other
Whitecloaks kept clear of them.</p>

<p>All in all, it was enough to make Elayne&rsquo;s stomach
clench. But there was no more than another hour&rsquo;s sunlight left, if
that, and that was taking into account the late-summer sunsets.
Even driving half the night again would not guarantee another inn
ahead, and driving on this late might call attention. Besides, they
had reason to halt early today.</p>

<p>She exchanged looks with Nynaeve, and after a moment
the other woman nodded and said, &ldquo;We have to stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the coach drew up in front of The Light of
Truth, Juilin hopped down to open the door, and Nynaeve waited with
a deferential look on her face for him to hand Elayne down. She did
flash Elayne a smile, though; she would not slide back into sulks.
The leather scrip she slung from her shoulder appeared a bit
incongruous, but not too much so, Elayne hoped. Now that Nynaeve
had acquired a stock of herbs and ointments again, she did not mean
to let them out of her sight.</p>

<p>From her first sight of the inn&rsquo;s sign&mdash;a
flaring golden sun like that the Children wore on their cloaks&mdash;she wished the &ldquo;boar-horse&rdquo; had taken exception to this
place instead of the other. At least there was no shepherd&rsquo;s crook
behind it. Half the men filling the common room wore snowy white
cloaks, their helmets set on the tables in front of them. She took
a deep breath and a firm hold on herself not to spin on her heel
and leave.</p>

<p>Aside from the soldiers, it was a pleasant inn, with
high-beamed ceilings and dark polished paneling. Cut green branches
decorated the cold hearths of two large fireplaces, and good
cooking smells wafted from the kitchens. The white-aproned serving
maids all seemed cheerful as they scurried among the tables with
trays of wine and ale and food.</p>

<p>The arrival of a lady created little stir, this close
to the capital. Or perhaps it was because of that lord&rsquo;s manor. A
few men looked at her; more eyed her &ldquo;maid&rdquo; with interest, though
Nynaeve&rsquo;s stern frown, when she realized they were staring at her,
quickly turned them back to their wine. Nynaeve seemed to think a
man looking was a crime, even if he said nothing and did not leer.
Given that, sometimes Elayne wondered why she did not wear less
becoming clothes. She had had to work very hard to make sure that
simple gray dress fit the other woman properly. Nynaeve was
hopeless with a needle when it came to fine work.</p>

<p>The innkeeper, Mistress Jharen, was a plump woman
with long gray curls, a warm smile, and searching dark eyes. Elayne
suspected she could spot a worn hem or a flat purse at ten paces.
They obviously passed muster, for she made a deep curtsy, spreading
her gray skirts wide, and made effusive welcome, inquiring whether
the Lady was on her way to or from Amador.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From,&rdquo; Elayne replied with a languid hauteur. &ldquo;The
city&rsquo;s balls were most enjoyable, and King Ailron is quite as
handsome as they say, which is not always so for kings, but I must
return to my estates. I require a room for myself and Nana, and
something for my footman and driver.&rdquo; Thinking of Nynaeve and the
trundle, she added, &ldquo;I must have two full beds. I need Nana close,
and if she has only a trundle, she will keep me awake with her
snoring.&rdquo; Nynaeve&rsquo;s respectful face slipped&mdash;just a fraction,
thankfully&mdash;but it was quite true. She had snored
terribly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, my Lady,&rdquo; the plump innkeeper said. &ldquo;I
have just the thing. But your men will have to bed down in the
stable, in the hayloft. I am quite crowded, as you can see. A
troupe of vagabonds brought some horrible great animals into the
village yesterday and one of them quite destroyed The King&rsquo;s
Lancer. Poor Sim has lost half his custom or more, and they&rsquo;ve all
come here.&rdquo; Mistress Jharen&rsquo;s smile was more satisfaction than
commiseration. &ldquo;I do have one room left, however.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure it will do very well. If you will send up
a light repast and some wash water, I think I shall retire early.&rdquo;
There was still sunlight showing in the windows, but she put a hand
delicately over her mouth as if stifling a yawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, my Lady. As you wish. This way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mistress Jharen seemed to think she had to keep
Elayne entertained as she showed them to the second floor. She went
on the whole way about the crowding at the inn and how it was a
miracle that she had a room left, about the vagrants with their
animals and how they had been chased out of town and good riddance
to rubbish, about all the nobles who had stayed at her
establishment over the years, even the Lord Captain Commander of
the Children, once. Why, a Hunter of the Horn had come through just
the day before, on his way to Tear, where they said the Stone of
Tear had fallen into the hands of some false Dragon, and was it not
horrible wickedness that men could do such things? &ldquo;I hope they
never find it.&rdquo; The innkeeper&rsquo;s gray curls swung as she shook her
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Horn of Valere?&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;Why ever
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my Lady, if they find it, it means the Last
Battle is coming. The Dark One breaking free.&rdquo; Mistress Jharen
shivered. &ldquo;The Light send the Horn is never found. That way, the
Last Battle cannot happen, can it?&rdquo; There did not seem to be much
answer to such curious logic.</p>

<p>The bedchamber was snug, if not <em>exactly</em>
cramped. Two narrow beds with striped coverlets stood to either
side of a window looking out onto the street, and little more than
walking room separating them from each other or the white-plastered
walls. A small table holding a lamp and tinderbox between the beds,
a tiny, flowered rug, and a washstand with a small mirror above it
completed the furnishings. Everything was clean and well polished,
at least.</p>

<p>The innkeeper plumped the pillows and smoothed the
coverlets and said the mattresses were the best goose down and the
Lady&rsquo;s men would be bringing her chests up by the back stairs and
everything would be very cozy, there was a good breeze at night if
the Lady opened the window and left the door cracked. As though she
would sleep with her door open to a public hallway. Two aproned
girls arrived with a large blue pitcher of steaming water and a
large lacquered tray covered with a white cloth before Elayne
managed to get Mistress Jharen out. The shape of a wine pitcher and
two cups mounded up one side of the cloth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she believed we might go to The King&rsquo;s
Lancer even with a hole in it,&rdquo; she said, once the door was firmly
shut. Looking around the room, she grimaced. There would barely be
room for them and the chests. &ldquo;I am not certain we shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not snore,&rdquo; Nynaeve said in a tight voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you do not. I had to say something,
though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave a loud harrumph, but all she said was &ldquo;I
am glad I am tired enough to go to sleep. Aside from that forkroot,
I did not recognize anything to aid sleep in what that Macura woman
had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took Thom and Juilin three trips to bring the
iron-bound wooden chests up, grumbling all the while, the way men
did, about having to haul them up the narrow stairs at the rear of
the inn. They were muttering about being made to sleep in the
stables, too, when they brought in the first one between them&mdash;it had leaf-shaped hinges; the bulk of their money and
valuables were in the bottom of that, including the recovered
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>&mdash;but one glance at the room and they
shared a look and shut their mouths. About that, at least.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to see what we can learn in the common
room,&rdquo; Thom said once the last chest was jammed in. Barely enough
space remained to reach the washstand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And maybe take a walk around the village,&rdquo; Juilin
added. &ldquo;Men talk when there&rsquo;s as much dislike as I saw in the
street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be very good,&rdquo; Elayne said. They did so
want to think they had more to do than haul and carry. It had been
so in Tanchico&mdash;and Mardecin, of course&mdash;and might well
be again, but hardly here. &ldquo;Do be careful not to get into any
trouble with the Whitecloaks, now.&rdquo; A long-suffering look passed
between them, just as if she had not seen both with bruised and
bleeding faces after jaunts for information, but she forgave them,
and smiled at Thom. &ldquo;I cannot wait to hear what you learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the morning,&rdquo; Nynaeve said firmly. She was
looking away from Elayne so hard that she might as well have been
glowering at her. &ldquo;If you disturb us before then for less than
Trollocs, you&rsquo;ll learn the reason why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The glance that passed between the two men spoke
volumes&mdash;it made Nynaeve&rsquo;s eyebrows rise sharply&mdash;but
once she had reluctantly handed over a few coins, they left
agreeing to let the women sleep untroubled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I cannot even speak to Thom,&rdquo; Elayne began when
they were gone, but Nynaeve cut her off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not having them walk in on me asleep in my
shift.&rdquo; She was awkwardly undoing the buttons down the back of her
dress. Elayne went to help her, and she said, &ldquo;I can manage. You
get the ring out for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a sniff, Elayne pulled up her skirt to reach the
small pocket she had sewn to the underside. If Nynaeve wanted to be
peevish, let her; she would not respond even if Nynaeve began
ranting again. There were two rings in the pocket. She left the
golden Great Serpent she had been given on being raised to
Accepted, and took out the stone ring.</p>

<p>All flecks and stripes of red and blue and brown, it
was just too large to fit a finger, and flattened and twisted
besides. Odd as it seemed, the ring had only one edge; a finger
drawn along that edge would circle inside and out before coming
back to where it began. It was a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, and what it
did was allow access to <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, even for someone
who did not have the Talent that Egwene and the Aiel dreamwalkers
shared. All that was needed was to sleep with it next to your skin.
Unlike the two <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> they had recovered from the
Black Ajah, it did not require channeling. For all Elayne knew,
even a man might be able to use it.</p>

<p>Clad only in her linen shift, Nynaeve threaded the
ring onto the leather thong with Lan&rsquo;s signet and her own Great
Serpent, then re-knotted and hung it back around her neck before
lying down atop one of the beds. Carefully tucking the rings in
next to her skin, she settled her head on the pillows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there time before Egwene and the Wise Ones get
there?&rdquo; Elayne asked. &ldquo;I can never reason out what hour it is in
the Waste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is time unless she comes early, which she
won&rsquo;t. The Wise Ones keep her on a very short leash. It will do her
good, in the long run. She was always headstrong.&rdquo; Nynaeve opened
her eyes, looking right at her&mdash;at her!&mdash;as if that
could stand for her as well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember to tell Egwene to let Rand know that I am
thinking of him.&rdquo; She was <em>not</em> going to let the woman start
a row. &ldquo;Tell her to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;tell him that I love him, and only him.&rdquo;
There. She had it out.</p>

<p>Nynaeve rolled her eyes in what was really a most
offensive way. &ldquo;If you wish me to,&rdquo; she said dryly, snuggling
herself into the pillows.</p>

<p>As the other woman&rsquo;s breathing began to slow, Elayne
pushed one of the chests against the door and sat on it to wait.
She always hated waiting. It would serve Nynaeve right if she went
down to the common room. Thom would probably still be there, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;And nothing. He was supposed to be her coachman. She wondered
whether Nynaeve had thought of that before agreeing to be the maid.
With a sigh, she leaned back against the door. She <em>did</em>
hate waiting.</p>
