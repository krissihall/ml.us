<h4><em>Meetings.</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
effects of the ring <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> did not
startle Nynaeve anymore. She was in the place she had been thinking
of when sleep closed in, the great chamber in Tear called the Heart
of the Stone, within the massive fortress called the Stone of Tear.
The gilded stand-lamps were unlit, but pale light seemed to come
from everywhere and nowhere, to simply be, all around her, fading
into dim shadows in the distance. At least it was not hot; it never
seemed hot or cold in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.</p>

<p>Huge redstone columns ran off in every direction, the
vaulted dome far above lost in dim shadows along with more golden
lamps hanging on golden chains. The pale floorstones beneath her
feet were worn; the High Lords of Tear had come to this chamber&mdash;in
the waking world, of course&mdash;only when their law and custom
demanded, but they had come ever since the Breaking of the World.
Centered beneath the dome was <em>Callandor</em>, apparently a
glittering sword made of crystal, driven half its length into the
stone of the floor. Just as Rand had left it.</p>

<p>She did not go near <em>Callandor</em>. Rand claimed
to have woven traps around it with <em>saidin</em>, traps that no
woman could see. She expected they would be nasty&mdash;the best
of men could be vicious when they tried to be devious&mdash;nasty
and just as primed for a woman as for the men who might use that
<em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>. He had meant to guard it against those in the
Tower as much as the Forsaken. Aside from Rand himself, the one who
touched <em>Callandor</em> might die or worse.</p>

<p>That was a fact of <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. What was
in the waking world was here, too, although the reverse was not
always so. The World of Dreams, the Unseen World, reflected the
waking world, if sometimes in odd ways, and perhaps other worlds as
well. Verin Sedai had told Egwene that there was a pattern woven of
worlds, of the reality here and others, just as the weaving of
people&rsquo;s lives made up the Pattern of the Ages. <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> touched them all, yet few could enter except
accidentally, for unknowing moments, during their own mundane
dreams. Dangerous moments for those dreamers, though they never
knew it unless they were very unlucky. Another fact of <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> was that what happened to the dreamer here
happened in the waking world, too. To die in the World of Dreams
was to die in fact.</p>

<p>She had the sensation of being watched from the
dimnesses between the columns, but it did not trouble her. It was
<em>not</em> Moghedien. <em>Imaginary eyes; there are no watchers.
I told Elayne to ignore them, and here I</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Moghedien would
certainly do more than look. Even so, she wished she were angry
enough to channel. Not that she was frightened, of course. Only not
angry. Not frightened at all.</p>

<p>The twisted stone ring felt light, as if it were
trying to drift up out of her shift, reminding her that she was
wearing only that. As soon as she thought of clothing herself, she
was in a dress. It was a trick of <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> that she
liked; in some ways channeling was unnecessary, for here she could
do things that she doubted any Aes Sedai had ever done with the
Power. It was not the dress she had expected, though; not good
stout Two Rivers wool. The high neck trimmed in Jaerecuz lace came
right up under her chin, but pale yellow silk draped her in folds
that clung revealingly. How many times had she called Taraboner
gowns like this indecent when she had worn them to blend into
Tanchico? It seemed that she had grown more used to them than she
knew.</p>

<p>Giving her braid a sharp pull for the waywardness of
her own mind, she left the dress as it was. The gown might not be
as she wanted, but she was no flighty girl to go leaping and
squealing over it. <em>A dress is a dress</em>. She would wear it
when Egwene arrived, with whichever of the Wise Ones accompanied
her this time, and if any of them said a word&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>I did not
come early to blather at myself about dresses!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Birgitte?&rdquo; Silence answered her, and she raised her
voice, though it should not have been necessary. In this place,
this particular woman could hear her own name spoken on the other
side of the world. &ldquo;Birgitte?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A woman stepped out from among the columns, blue eyes
calm and proudly confident, her golden hair in a long braid more
intricate than Nynaeve&rsquo;s own. Her short white coat and voluminous
yellow silk trousers, gathered at the ankles above short boots with
raised heels, were garments of more than two thousand years ago
that she had taken a liking to. The arrows in the quiver at her
side appeared to be silver, and so did the bow she carried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Gaidal about?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked. He was usually
close by Birgitte, and he made Nynaeve nervous, refusing to
acknowledge her existence, scowling when Birgitte spoke to her. It
had been something of a shock at first to find Gaidal Cain and
Birgitte&mdash;long-dead heroes linked in so many stories and
legends&mdash;in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. But, as Birgitte herself
had said, where better for heroes bound to the Wheel of Time to
await rebirth than in a dream? A dream that had existed as long as
the Wheel. It was they, Birgitte and Gaidal Cain and Rogosh
Eagle-eye and Artur Hawkwing and all the others, that the Horn of
Valere would summon back to fight at Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don.</p>

<p>Birgitte&rsquo;s braid swung as she shook her head. &ldquo;I have
not seen him for some time. I think the Wheel has spun him out
again. It always happens so.&rdquo; Expectation and concern both touched
her voice.</p>

<p>If Birgitte was right, then somewhere in the world a
boychild had been born, a mewling babe with no knowledge of who he
was, yet destined for adventures that would make new legends. The
Wheel wove the heroes into the Pattern as they were needed, to
shape the Pattern, and when they died they returned here to wait
again. That was what it meant to be bound to the Wheel. New heroes
could find themselves bound so as well, men and women whose bravery
and accomplishments raised them far above the ordinary, but once
bound, it was forever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long do you have?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked. &ldquo;Years yet,
surely.&rdquo; Birgitte was always tied to Gaidal, had been tied in story
after story, in Age after Age, of adventure and a romance that even
the Wheel of Time did not break. She was always born after Gaidal;
a year, or five, or ten, but after.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know, Nynaeve. Time here is not like time
in the waking world. I met you here last ten days gone, as it seems
to me, and Elayne only a day before. What was it for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four days and three,&rdquo; Nynaeve muttered. She and
Elayne had been coming to speak with Birgitte as often as they
could, though too frequently it had not been possible with Thom and
Juilin sharing the camp and standing night guard. Birgitte actually
remembered the War of Power, one lifetime of it anyway, and the
Forsaken. Her past lives were like books fondly remembered from
long ago, the more distant dimmer than the nearer, but the Forsaken
stood out. Especially Moghedien.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, Nynaeve? The flow of time here can shift in
larger ways, too. It might be months before I am born again, or
days. Here, for me. In the waking world it could be years yet
before my birth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With an effort Nynaeve suppressed her vexation. &ldquo;Then
we mustn&rsquo;t waste what time we have. Have you seen any of them since
we last met?&rdquo; There was no need to say who.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too many. Lanfear is often in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, of course, but I have seen Rahvin and Sammael
and Graendal. Demandred. And Semirhage.&rdquo; Birgitte&rsquo;s voice tightened
at the last name; even Moghedien, who hated her, did not frighten
her visibly, but Semirhage was another matter.</p>

<p>Nynaeve shivered as well&mdash;the golden-haired
woman had told her too much of that one&mdash;and realized she was
wearing a thick wool cloak, with a deep hood pulled up to hide her
face; flushing, she made it disappear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of them have seen you?&rdquo; she asked anxiously.
Birgitte was more vulnerable than herself in many ways, despite her
knowledge of <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. She had never been able to
channel; any of the Forsaken could destroy her as if crushing an
ant, without breaking stride. And if she were destroyed here, there
would be no rebirth for her ever again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not so unskilled&mdash;or so foolish&mdash;as
to allow that.&rdquo; Birgitte leaned on her silver bow; legend said she
never missed with that bow and her silver arrows. &ldquo;They are
concerned with each other, not anyone else. I have seen Rahvin and
Sammael, Graendal and Lanfear, each stalking the others unseen. And
Demandred and Semirhage each shadowing them as well. I have not
seen so much of them here since they were freed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are up to something.&rdquo; Nynaeve bit her lip in
vexed frustration. &ldquo;But what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot say yet, Nynaeve. In the War of the Shadow,
they were always plotting, against each other as often as not, but
their work has never boded well for the world, waking or
dreaming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try to find out, Birgitte; as much as you can
safely, at any rate. Do not take any risks.&rdquo; The other woman&rsquo;s face
did not change, but Nynaeve thought she was amused; the fool woman
thought as little of danger as did Lan. She wished she could ask
about the White Tower, about what Siuan might be scheming, but
Birgitte could neither see nor touch the waking world unless she
was called there by the Horn. <em>You are just trying to avoid what
you really want to ask!</em> &ldquo;Have you seen Moghedien?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Birgitte sighed, &ldquo;but not for lack of trying.
In the usual course I can find anyone who knows they are in the
World of Dreams; there is a feel, like ripples spreading through
the air from them. Or perhaps from their awareness; I do not know,
really. I am a soldier, not a scholar. Either she has not come into
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> since you defeated her, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She
hesitated, and Nynaeve wanted to stop her from saying what she knew
would come next, but Birgitte was too strong to dodge unpalatable
possibilities. &ldquo;Or else she knows I have been looking for her. She
can hide, that one. She is not called the Spider for nothing.&rdquo; That
was what a <em>moghedien</em> had been, in the Age of Legends; a
tiny spider that spun its webs in secret places, its bite
poisonous enough to kill in heartbeats.</p>

<p>Suddenly very much aware of feeling unseen eyes,
Nynaeve shivered heavily. It was not trembling. Just a shiver, not
trembling. Still, she kept the sleek Taraboner gown firmly in mind
lest she abruptly find herself wearing armor. It was embarrassing
enough if that sort of thing happened when she was alone, even more
under the cool blue gaze of a woman valiant enough to be a match
for Gaidal Cain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you find her even when she wants to remain
hidden, Birgitte?&rdquo; It was a very great deal to ask, if Moghedien
knew she was being hunted; like searching for a lion in high grass
armed only with a stick.</p>

<p>The other woman did not hesitate. &ldquo;Perhaps. I will
try.&rdquo; Hefting her bow, she added, &ldquo;I must go, now. I do not want to
risk being seen by the others when they come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve put a hand on her arm to stop her. &ldquo;It would
be a help if you let me tell them. That way I could share what
you&rsquo;ve told me about the Forsaken with Egwene and the Wise Ones,
and they could tell Rand. Birgitte, he needs to know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You promised, Nynaeve.&rdquo; Those bright blue eyes were
unyielding as ice. &ldquo;The prescripts say that we must not let anyone
know that we reside in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. I have broken many
by speaking to you, much more by giving aid, because I cannot stand
by and watch you battle the Shadow&mdash;I have fought that battle
in more lifetimes than I can remember&mdash;but I <em>will</em>
keep as many of the prescripts as I can. You must hold to your
promise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; she said indignantly, &ldquo;unless you
release me from it. And I <em>do</em> ask you to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Birgitte was gone. One moment Nynaeve&rsquo;s hand
rested on a white coatsleeve, the next on empty air. In her mind
she ran through a few curses she had overheard from Thom and
Juilin, the sort she would have scolded Elayne for listening to,
much less using. There was no point calling Birgitte&rsquo;s name again.
She probably would not come. Nynaeve only hoped she responded the
next time she or Elayne called. &ldquo;Birgitte! I will keep my promise,
Birgitte!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She would have heard that. Perhaps by their next
meeting she would know something of Moghedien&rsquo;s activities. Nynaeve
almost hoped she would not. If she did, it meant that Moghedien
really was stalking <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.</p>

<p><em>Fool woman! &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t look for snakes, you
cannot complain when one bites you.&rdquo;</em> She really did want to
meet Elayne&rsquo;s Lini one day.</p>

<p>The emptiness of the vast chamber oppressed her, all
those great polished columns and that sense of being watched from
the dimness between. <em>If there really was anybody there,
Birgitte would have known</em>.</p>

<p>She realized that she was smoothing the silk gown
over her hips, and, to take her mind off eyes that were not there,
she concentrated on the dress. It had been in good Two Rivers
woolens that Lan had first seen her, and a simple embroidered dress
that she had been wearing when he professed his love, but she
wanted him to see her in gowns like this. It would not be indecent
if he was the one seeing her.</p>

<p>A tall standing mirror appeared, casting her
reflection as she turned this way and that, even peering back over
her shoulder. The yellow folds sheathed her closely, suggesting
everything they hid. The Women&rsquo;s Circle in Emond&rsquo;s Field would have
hauled her off for a good talking to in private, Wisdom or no
Wisdom. Yet it was quite beautiful. Here, alone, she could admit
that she had a bit more than gotten used to wearing something like
this in public. <em>You enjoyed it</em>, she scolded herself. <em>
You are every bit as much a hussy as Elayne seems to be turning
into!</em> But it was beautiful. And maybe not as immodest as she
had always said. Not a neckline cut halfway to her knees, like the
First of Mayene, for instance. Well, perhaps Berelain&rsquo;s were not
that low, but they were still far deeper than respectability
required.</p>

<p>She had heard about what Domani women often wore;
even Taraboners called <em>those</em> indecent. With the thought,
the yellow silk folds became rippling flows, with a narrow belt of
woven gold. And thin. Her face colored. Very thin. Barely opaque at
all, in fact. The gown certainly did more than suggest. If Lan saw
her in that, he would not gabble that his love for her was hopeless
and that he would not give her widow&rsquo;s weeds for a bridal gift. One
glimpse, and his blood would catch fire. He would&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What under the Light is that you have on, Nynaeve?&rdquo;
Egwene asked in scandalized tones.</p>

<p>Nynaeve leaped straight up, spinning, and when she
came down facing Egwene and Melaine&mdash;it would be Melaine,
though none of the Wise Ones would have been any better&mdash;the
mirror was gone and she was wearing a dark woolen Two Rivers dress
thick enough for the depths of winter. Mortified at being startled
as much as anything else&mdash;it <em>was</em> mainly at being
startled&mdash;she changed the dress instantly, without thinking,
flashing back into the gossamer Domani and just as quickly to the
yellow Taraboner folds.</p>

<p>Her face flamed. They probably thought her a complete
fool. And in front of Melaine, at that. The Wise One was beautiful,
with her long red-gold hair and clear green eyes. Not that she
cared a whit how the woman looked. But Melaine had been at her last
meeting here with Egwene, too, and taunted her about Lan. Nynaeve
had lost her temper over it. Egwene claimed they were not taunts,
not among Aiel women, but Melaine had complimented Lan&rsquo;s shoulders,
and his hands, and his eyes. What right did that green-eyed cat
have to look at Lan&rsquo;s shoulders? Not that she had any doubts of his
faithfulness. But he was a man, and far away from her, and Melaine
was right there, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Firmly, she put a stop to that line of
reasoning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Lan&mdash;?&rdquo; She thought her face was going to
burn off. <em>Can&rsquo;t you control your own tongue, woman?</em> But
she would not&mdash;could not&mdash;back away, not with Melaine
there. Egwene&rsquo;s bemused smile was bad enough, but Melaine dared to
put on a look of understanding. &ldquo;Is he well?&rdquo; She tried for cool
composure, but it came out strained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is well,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;He worries about whether
you are safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve let out a breath she had not realized she was
holding. The Waste was a dangerous place even without the likes of
Couladin and the Shaido, and the man did not know the meaning of
caution. He was worried about her safety? Did the fool man think
she could not take care of herself?</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve finally reached Amadicia,&rdquo; she said quickly,
hoping to cover herself. <em>A flapping tongue, and then sighs! The
man has stolen my wits!</em> There was no telling from the others&rsquo;
faces whether she was succeeding. &ldquo;A village, called Sienda, east
of Amador. Whitecloaks everywhere, but they don&rsquo;t look at us twice.
It is others we have to worry about.&rdquo; In front of Melaine, she had
to be careful&mdash;to bend the truth a little, in fact, here and
there&mdash;but she told them of Ronde Macura and her odd message,
and her trying to drug them. Trying, because she could not make
herself admit in front of Melaine that the woman had succeeded.
<em>Light, what am I doing? I&rsquo;ve never lied to Egwene before in my
life!</em></p>

<p>The supposed reason&mdash;the return of a runaway
Accepted&mdash;certainly could not be mentioned, not in front of
one of the Wise Ones. They thought that she and Elayne were full
Aes Sedai. But she had to let Egwene know the truth of that
somehow. &ldquo;It might have to do with some plot concerning Andor, but
Elayne and you and I have things in common, Egwene, and I think we
should be just as careful as Elayne.&rdquo; The girl nodded slowly; she
looked stunned, as well she might, but she seemed to understand. &ldquo;A
good thing the taste of that tea made me suspicious. Imagine trying
to feed forkroot to someone who knows herbs as well as I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Schemes within schemes,&rdquo; Melaine murmured. &ldquo;The
Great Serpent is a good sign for you Aes Sedai, I think. Someday
you may swallow yourselves by accident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have news ourselves,&rdquo; Egwene said.</p>

<p>Nynaeve could see no reason for the girl&rsquo;s haste.
<em>I am certainly not going to let the woman bait me into losing
my temper. And I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t get angry over her insulting
the Tower</em>. She took her hand away from her braid. What Egwene
had to say put temper right out of her head.</p>

<p>Couladin crossing the Spine of the World was surely
grave, and Rand following scarcely less so; he was pushing hard for
the Jangai Pass, marching from first light until after dusk, and
Melaine said they would soon reach it. Conditions in Cairhien were
harsh enough without a war between Aiel on its territory. And a new
Aiel War to come, surely, if he tried to carry out his mad plan.
Mad. Not yet, surely. He had to hang on to sanity, somehow.</p>

<p><em>How long since I was worrying how to protect
him?</em> she thought bitterly. <em>And now I just want him to stay
sane to fight the Last Battle</em>. Not only for that reason, but
for that one, too. He was what he was. <em>The Light burn me, I&rsquo;m
as bad as Siuan Sanche or any of them!</em></p>

<p>It was what Egwene had to say about Moiraine that
shocked her. &ldquo;She <em>obeys</em> him?&rdquo; she said incredulously.</p>

<p>Egwene gave a vigorous nod, in that ridiculous Aiel
scarf. &ldquo;Last night they had an argument&mdash;she&rsquo;s still trying
to convince him not to cross the Dragonwall&mdash;and finally he
told her to stand outside until she cooled down; she looked about
to swallow her tongue, but she did it. She stayed out in the night
for an hour, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not proper,&rdquo; Melaine said, resettling her
shawl firmly. &ldquo;Men have no more business ordering Aes Sedai about
than they do Wise Ones. Even the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They certainly do not,&rdquo; Nynaeve agreed, then had to
clamp her mouth shut to keep from gaping at herself. <em>What do I
care if he makes her dance to his tune? She has made all of us
dance to hers often enough</em>. But it was not proper. <em>I do
not want to be Aes Sedai, just to learn more about Healing. I want
to stay who I am. Let him order her about!</em> Still, it was not
proper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least he talks with her, now,&rdquo; Egwene said.
&ldquo;Before, he turned to acid if she came within ten feet of him.
Nynaeve, his head swells bigger every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Back when I thought you&rsquo;d follow me as Wisdom,&rdquo;
Nynaeve told her wryly, &ldquo;I taught you how to take swelling down.
Best for him if you do it, even if he has turned into the king bull
in the pasture. Maybe more because he is. It seems to me that kings&mdash;and queens&mdash;can be fools when they forget what they
are and act like who they are, but they&rsquo;re worse when they only
remember what they are and forget who. Most could do with someone
whose only job is to remind them that they eat and sweat and cry
the same as any farmer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Melaine folded her shawl around her, seeming unsure
whether to agree or not, but Egwene said, &ldquo;I try, but sometimes he
doesn&rsquo;t seem like himself at all, and even when he is, his
arrogance is usually too thick a bubble to prick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do the best you can. Helping him hold on to himself
may be the best thing that anyone could do. For him, and the rest
of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That produced a silence. She and Egwene certainly did
not like to talk about the eventuality of Rand going mad, and
Melaine could not like it any better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have something else important to tell you,&rdquo; she
went on after a moment. &ldquo;I think the Forsaken are planning
something.&rdquo; It was not the same as telling them about Birgitte. She
made it seem that she herself had seen Lanfear and the others. In
truth, Moghedien was the only one she could recognize at sight, and
maybe Asmodean, though she had only seen him once, and at a
distance. She hoped neither of them thought to ask how she knew who
was who, or why she thought Moghedien might be skulking about. In
actuality, the problem did not arise from that at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been wandering the World of Dreams?&rdquo;
Melaine&rsquo;s eyes were green ice.</p>

<p>Nynaeve met her level stare for level stare, despite
Egwene&rsquo;s rueful head-shaking. &ldquo;I could hardly see Rahvin and the
rest without it, now could I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aes Sedai, you know little, and you try too much.
You should not have been taught the few pieces that you have. For
myself, I sometimes regret that we agreed even to these meetings.
Unschooled women should not be allowed in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have schooled myself in more than you ever taught
me.&rdquo; Nynaeve kept her voice cool with an effort. &ldquo;I learned to
channel on my own, and I do not see why <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>
should be any different.&rdquo; It was only stubborn anger that made her
say that. She had taught herself to channel, true, but without
knowing what it was that she was doing and only after a fashion.
Before the White Tower, she had Healed sometimes, but unaware,
until Moiraine proved it to her. Her teachers in the Tower had
said that was why she needed to be angry in order to channel; she
had hidden her ability from herself, afraid of it, and only fury
could break through that long-buried fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are one of those the Aes Sedai call wilders.&rdquo;
There was a hint of something in the last word, but whether scorn
or pity, Nynaeve did not like it. The term was seldom
complimentary, in, the Tower. Of course, there were no wilders
among the Aiel. The Wise Ones who could channel found every last
girl with the spark born in her, those who would develop the
ability to channel sooner or later even if they did not try to
learn. They claimed also to find every girl without the spark who
could learn if instructed. No Aiel girl died trying to learn by
herself. &ldquo;You know the dangers of learning the Power without
guidance, Aes Sedai. Do not think the dangers of the dream are
less. They are just as great, perhaps more for those who venture
without knowledge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am careful,&rdquo; Nynaeve said in a tight voice. She
had not come to be lectured by this sun-haired vixen of an Aiel. &ldquo;I
know what I am doing, Melaine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know nothing. You are as headstrong as this one
was when she came to us.&rdquo; The Wise One gave Egwene a smile that
actually seemed affectionate. &ldquo;We tamed her excessive exuberance,
and now she learns swiftly. Though she does have many faults,
still.&rdquo; Egwene&rsquo;s pleased grin faded; Nynaeve suspected that grin
was why Melaine had added the last. &ldquo;If you wish to wander the
dream,&rdquo; the Aiel woman went on, &ldquo;come to us. We will tame your
zeal, as well, and teach you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not need taming, thank you very much,&rdquo; Nynaeve
said with a polite smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Aan&rsquo;allein</em> will die on the day he learns
that you are dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ice stabbed into Nynaeve&rsquo;s heart. <em>Aan&rsquo;allein</em>
was what the Aiel called Lan. One Man, it meant in the Old Tongue,
or Man Alone, or the Man Who Is an Entire People; exact
translations from the Old Tongue were often difficult. The Aiel had
a great deal of respect for Lan, the man who would not give up his
war with the Shadow, the enemy that had destroyed his nation. &ldquo;You
are a dirty fighter,&rdquo; she muttered.</p>

<p>Melaine quirked an eyebrow. &ldquo;Do we fight? If we do,
then know that in battle there is only winning and losing. Rules
against hurting are for games. I want your promise that you will do
nothing in the dream without first asking one of us. I know Aes
Sedai cannot lie, so I would hear you say it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve gritted her teeth. The words would be easy to
say. She did not have to hold to them; she was not bound by the
Three Oaths. But it would be admitting that Melaine was right. She
did not believe it, and she would not say it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll not promise, Melaine,&rdquo; Egwene said finally.
&ldquo;When she gets that muley look, she wouldn&rsquo;t come out of the house
if you showed her the roof on fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve spared a piece of glare for her. Muley,
indeed! When all she did was refuse to be pushed about like a rag
doll.</p>

<p>After a long moment, Melaine sighed. &ldquo;Very well. But
it would be well to remember, Aes Sedai, that you are but a child
in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. Come, Egwene. We must go.&rdquo; An amused
wince crossed Egwene&rsquo;s face as the two faded away.</p>

<p>Abruptly Nynaeve realized that her clothes had
changed. Had been changed; the Wise Ones knew enough of <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> to alter things about others as well as
themselves. She wore a white blouse and a dark skirt, but unlike
those of the women who had just gone, this stopped well short of
her knees. Her shoes and stockings were gone, and her hair was
divided into two braids, one over each ear, woven with yellow
ribbons. A rag doll with a carved and painted face sat beside her
bare feet. She could hear her teeth grinding. This had happened
once before, and she had pried out of Egwene that this was how the
Aiel dressed little girls.</p>

<p>In a fury she switched back to the yellow Taraboner
silk&mdash;this time it adhered even more closely&mdash;and
kicked the doll. It sailed away, vanishing in midair. That Melaine
probably had her eye on Lan; the Aiel all seemed to think he was
some sort of hero. The high neck became a tall lace collar, and the
deep narrow neckline showed her cleavage. If that woman so much
as smiled at him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! If he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! Suddenly she became aware
of her fast-sinking, rapidly widening neckline and hastily brought
it back up; not all the way, but enough that she did not have to
blush. The dress had grown so tight that she could not move; she
took care of that, too.</p>

<p>So she was supposed to <em>ask permission</em>, was
she? Go begging the Wise Ones before doing anything? Had she not
defeated Moghedien? They had been properly impressed at the time,
but they seemed to have forgotten.</p>

<p>If she could not use Birgitte to find out what was
going on in the Tower, perhaps there was a way she could do it
herself.</p>
