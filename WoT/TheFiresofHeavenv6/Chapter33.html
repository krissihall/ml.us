<h4><em>A Question of Crimson</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
knife brushed Nynaeve&rsquo;s hair as it thunked into
the board she was leaning against, and she flinched behind her
blindfold. She wished she had a decent braid instead of locks
hanging loose about her shoulders. If that blade had cut even one
strand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Fool woman</em>, she thought bitterly. <em>Fool,
fool woman</em>. With the scarf folded over her eyes she could just
see a narrow line of light at the bottom. It seemed bright, from
the darkness behind the thick folds. There had to be enough light
yet, even if it was late afternoon. Surely the man would not throw
when he could not see properly. The next blade struck on the other
side of her head; she could feel it vibrating. She thought it
almost touched her ear. She was going to kill Thom Merrilin and
Valan Luca. And maybe any other man she could get her hands on, on
sheer principle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pears,&rdquo; Luca shouted, as if he were not just
thirty paces from her. He must think the blindfold made her deaf as
well as blind.</p>

<p>Fumbling in the pouch at her belt, she brought out a
pear and carefully balanced it atop her head. She <em>was</em>
blind. A pure blind fool! Two more pears, and she gingerly extended
her arms to either side between the knives that outlined her,
holding one in either hand by the stems. There was a pause. She
opened her mouth to tell Thom Merrilin that if he so much as nicked
her, she would&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Tchunk-tchunk-tchunk!</em> The blades came so
fast she would have yelped if her throat had not contracted like a
fist. She held only the stem in her left hand, the other pear
trembled faintly with the knife through it, and the pear on her
head leaked juice into her hair.</p>

<p>Snatching the scarf off, she stalked toward Thom and
Luca, both of them grinning like maniacs. Before she could speak
one of the words boiling up in her, Luca said admiringly, &ldquo;You are
magnificent, Nana. Your bravery is magnificent, but you are more
so.&rdquo; He swirled that ridiculous red silk cloak in a bow, one hand
over his heart. &ldquo;I shall call this &lsquo;Rose Among Thorns.&rsquo; Though
truly, you are more beautiful than any mere rose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t take much bravery to stand like a stump.&rdquo;
A rose, was she? She would show him thorns. She would show both of
them. &ldquo;You listen to me, Valan Luca&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such courage. You never even flinch. I tell you, I
would not have the stomach to do what you are doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was the simple truth, she told herself. &ldquo;I am no
braver than I have to be,&rdquo; she said in a milder tone. It was hard
to shout at a man who insisted on telling you how brave you were.
Certainly better to hear than all that blather about roses. Thom
knuckled his long white mustaches as if he saw something funny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dress,&rdquo; Luca said, showing all of his teeth in a
smile. &ldquo;You will look wonderful in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she snapped. Whatever he had gained, he had
just lost by bringing this up again. Clarine had made the dress
Luca wanted her to wear, in silk more crimson than his cloak. It
was her opinion that the color was to hide blood if Thom&rsquo;s hand
slipped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Nana, beauty in danger is a <em>great</em>
draw.&rdquo; Luca&rsquo;s voice crooned as if whispering sweetness in her ear.
&ldquo;You will have every eye on you, every heart pounding for your
beauty and courage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you like it so much,&rdquo; she said firmly, &ldquo;you wear
it.&rdquo; Aside from the color, she was not about to show that much
bosom in public, whether or not Clarine thought it was proper. She
had seen Latelle&rsquo;s performing dress, all black spangles, with a
high neck to her chin. She could wear something like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What was
she thinking? She had no intention of actually going through with
this. She had only agreed to this practice to stop Luca scratching
at the wagon door every night to try convincing her.</p>

<p>The man was nothing if not deft at knowing when to
change the subject. &ldquo;What happened here?&rdquo; he asked, suddenly all
smooth solicitude.</p>

<p>She flinched as he touched her puffy eye. It was his
bad luck to choose that. He would have done better to continue
trying to stuff her into that red dress. &ldquo;I did not like the way it
looked at me in the mirror this morning, so I bit it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her flat tone and bared teeth made Luca snatch his
hand back. From the wary gleam in his dark eyes, he suspected she
might bite again. Thom was stroking his mustaches furiously, red in
the face from the effort of not laughing. He knew what had
happened, of course. He would. And as soon as she left, he would no
doubt regale Luca with his version of events. Men could not avoid
gossiping; it was in them at birth, and nothing women could do ever
got it out of them.</p>

<p>The daylight was dimmer than she had thought. The sun
sat red on the treetops to the west. &ldquo;If you ever try this again
without better light&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; she growled, shaking a fist at Thom.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost dusk!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; the man said, bushy eyebrow lifting,
&ldquo;this means you want to leave out the bit where <em>I</em> am
blindfolded?&rdquo; He was joking, of course. He had to be joking. &ldquo;As
you wish, Nana. From now on, only in the most perfect light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not until she stalked away, swishing her
skirts angrily, that she realized that she had agreed to actually
do this fool thing. By implication, at least. They would try to
hold her to it, as surely as the sun would set tonight. <em>Fool,
fool,</em> fool <em>woman!</em></p>

<p>The clearing where they&mdash;or Thom, at least,
burn him and Luca both!&mdash;had been practicing stood some
little distance from the camp over beside the road north. Doubtless
Luca had not wanted to upset the animals should Thom put one of his
knives through her heart. The man would likely have fed her corpse
to the lions. The only reason he wanted her to wear that dress was
so he could ogle what she had no intention of showing to anyone but
Lan, and burn him, too, for a stubborn fool man. She wished she had
him there so she could tell him so. She wished she had him there so
she could be sure he was safe. She broke a dead dogfennel and used
its feathery brown length like a whip to snap the heads off weeds
that poked through the leaves on the ground.</p>

<p>Last night, Elayne had said, Egwene reported fighting
in Cairhien, skirmishes with brigands, with Cairhienin who saw any
Aiel as an enemy, with Andoran soldiers trying to claim the Sun
Throne for Morgase. Lan had been involved in them; whenever
Moiraine let him out of her sight, he apparently managed to take
himself to the fighting, as if he could sense where it would be.
Nynaeve had never thought that she would want the Aes Sedai to keep
Lan on a short leash at her side.</p>

<p>This morning Elayne had still been disturbed about
her mother&rsquo;s soldiers being in Cairhien, fighting Rand&rsquo;s Aiel, but
what worried Nynaeve was the brigands. According to Egwene, if
anyone could identify stolen property in a brigand&rsquo;s possession, if
anyone could swear to seeing him kill anyone or burn so much as a
shed, Rand was hanging him. He did not put his hands on the rope,
but it was the same thing, and Egwene said he watched every
execution with a face cold and hard as the mountains. That was not
like him. He had been a gentle boy. Whatever had happened to him in
the Waste had been very much for the worse.</p>

<p>Well, Rand was far away, and her own problems&mdash;hers and Elayne&rsquo;s&mdash;were no nearer solution. The River Eldar
lay less than a mile north, spanned by a single lofty stone bridge
built between tall metal pillars that glistened without a speck of
rust. Remnants of an earlier time, certainly, perhaps even an
earlier Age. She had gone up to it at midday, right after they
arrived, but there had not been a boat in the river worthy of the
name. Rowboats, small fishing boats working along the reed-lined
banks, some strange, narrow little things that skittered over the
water propelled by kneeling men with paddles, even a squat barge
that looked to be moored in mud&mdash;there seemed to be a lot of
mud showing on both sides, some of it dried hard and cracked, yet
that was no wonder with the heat holding on so unseasonably&mdash;but nothing that could carry them swiftly away downriver as she
wanted. Not that she knew where it was to take them, yet.</p>

<p>Rack her brains as she would, she could not remember
the name of the town where the Blue sisters were supposed to be.
She swiped savagely at a scatterhead, and it burst in little white
feathers that floated to the ground. They probably were not there
anymore in any case, if they ever had been. But it was the only
clue they had to a safe place short of Tear. If she could only
remember it.</p>

<p>The only good thing on the entire journey north was
that Elayne had stopped flirting with Thom, there had not been an
incident since joining the show. At least, it would have been good
if Elayne had not apparently decided to pretend nothing had ever
happened. Yesterday Nynaeve had congratulated the girl on coming to
her senses, and Elayne had coolly replied, <em>Are you trying to
find out if I will stand in your way with Thom, Nynaeve? He&rsquo;s
rather old for you, and I did think you had planted your affections
elsewhere, but you are old enough to make your own decisions. I am
fond of Thom, as I think he is of me. I look on him like a second
father. If you want to flirt with him, you have my permission. But
I really did think you were more constant</em>.</p>

<p>Luca meant to cross the river in the morning, and
Samara, the town on the other side, in Ghealdan, was no fit place
to be. Luca had spent most of the day since their arrival over in
Samara, securing a place to set up his show, he was only concerned
that a number of other menageries had beaten him there, and he was
not the only one to have more than animals. That was why he had
grown particularly insistent about her letting Thom throw knives at
her. She was lucky he did not want it done high walking with
Elayne. The man seemed to think the most important thing in the
world was that his show should be bigger and better than any other.
For herself, the worrisome thing was that the Prophet was in
Samara, his followers crowding the town and spilling out into
tents, huts and shanties around it, a city that overwhelmed
Samara&rsquo;s own not inconsiderable size. It had a high stone wall, and
most of the buildings were stone as well, many as much as three
stories, and there were more roofs of slate or tile than
thatch.</p>

<p>This side of the Eldar was no better. They had passed
three Whitecloak encampments before reaching their stopping place,
hundreds of white tents in neat rows, and there had to be more they
had not seen. Whitecloaks on this side of the river, the Prophet
and maybe a riot waiting to happen on the other, and she had no
idea where to go and no way to get there except in a lumbering
wagon that moved no faster than she could walk. She wished she had
never let Elayne talk her into abandoning the coach. Not seeing a
weed close enough to snap without stepping aside, she broke the
dogfennel in half, then again, until the pieces were no longer than
her hand, and tossed them to the ground. She wished she could do
the same with Luca. And Galad Damodred, for sending them running
here. And al&rsquo;Lan Mandragoran, for not being here. Not that she
<em>needed</em> him, of course. But his presence would have been&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a comfort.</p>

<p>The camp was quiet, with evening meals cooking over
small fires beside the wagons. Petra was feeding the black-maned
lion, thrusting huge pieces of meat through the bars on a stick.
The female lions were already hunkered down over theirs
companionably, letting out an occasional growl if someone came too
close to their cage. Nynaeve stopped near Aludra&rsquo;s wagon; the
Illuminator was working with wooden mortar and pestle on a table
let down from the side of her wagon, muttering to herself over
whatever she was compounding. Three of the Chavanas smiled at
Nynaeve enticingly, motioning her to join them. Not Brugh, who
still glowered over his lip, though she had given him a salve to
make the swelling go down. Maybe if she hit the rest of them as
hard, they would listen to Luca&mdash;and more importantly, to
her!&mdash;and realize that she did not want their smiles. Too bad
Master Valan Luca could not follow his own instructions. Latelle
turned from the bear cage and gave her a tight smile; more of a
smirk, really. Mainly, though, Nynaeve stared at Cerandin, who was
filing the blunt toenails of one of the huge gray <em>s&rsquo;redit</em>
with what looked like a tool suitable for metal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That one,&rdquo; Aludra said, &ldquo;she uses the hands and the
feet with remarkable ability, no? Do not glare at me so, Nana,&rdquo; she
added, dusting her hands. &ldquo;I am not your enemy. Here. You must try
these new firesticks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve took the wooden box from the dark-haired
woman gingerly. It was a cube she could have held easily with one
hand, but she used both. &ldquo;I thought you called them strikers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe yes, maybe no. Firesticks, it says what they
are much better than strikers, yes? I have smoothed the little
holes that hold the sticks so they can no longer ignite on the
wood. A good idea, no? And the heads, they are a new formulation.
You will try them and tell me what you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve hurried on before the woman could press
another box on her. She held the thing as if it might explode,
which she was not certain it would not. Aludra had everyone trying
out her strikers, or firesticks, or whatever she would decide to
call them next. They certainly would light a fire or a lamp. They
could also burst into flame if the blue-gray heads rubbed against
each other or anything else rough. For herself, she would stick
with flint and steel, or a coal kept properly banked in a box of
sand. Much safer.</p>

<p>Juilin caught her before she could set foot on the
steps of the wagon she shared with Elayne, his gaze going straight
to her swollen eye. She glared at him so hard that he stepped back
and snatched that ridiculous conical cap from his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
over the river,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are a hundred or so Whitecloaks in
Samara&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Just watching, and being watched as hard themselves by
Ghealdanin soldiers. But I recognized one. The young fellow who was
sitting across from The Light of Truth in Sienda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled at him, and he took another hasty step
back, eyeing her wanly. Galad in Samara. That was all they needed.
&ldquo;You always bring such wonderful news, Juilin. We should have left
you in Tanchico, or better, on the dock in Tear.&rdquo; That was hardly
fair. Better he told her of Galad than that she walked around a
corner into the man. &ldquo;Thank you, Juilin. At least we know to keep
an eye out for him, now.&rdquo; His nod was hardly a proper response to
graciously offered thanks, and he hurried away, clapping his hat
on, as if he expected her to hit him. Men had no manners.</p>

<p>The interior of the wagon was far cleaner than it had
been when Thom and Juilin purchased it. The flaking paint had all
been scraped off&mdash;the men had grumbled about doing that&mdash;and the cabinets and the tiny table that was fastened to the
floor oiled until they shone. The small brick stove with its metal
chimney was never used&mdash;the nights were warm enough, and if
they began cooking in here, Thom and Juilin would never take
another turn&mdash;but it made a good place to keep their
valuables, the purses and the jewelry boxes. The washleather pouch
holding the seal that she had stuffed in as far as it would go and
had not touched since.</p>

<p>Elayne, seated on one of the narrow beds, stuffed
something under the blankets when Nynaeve climbed inside, but
before she could ask what it was, Elayne exclaimed, &ldquo;Your eye! What
happened to you?&rdquo; They needed to wash her hair in henpepper again;
faint hints of gold were showing at the roots of those black
tresses. It had to be done every few days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cerandin hit me when I wasn&rsquo;t looking,&rdquo; Nynaeve
muttered. The remembered taste of boiled catfern and powdered
mavinsleaf made her tongue curl. That was <em>not</em> why she had
let Elayne go to the last meeting in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, too.
She was <em>not</em> avoiding Egwene. It was just that she made
most of the journeys into the World of Dreams between meetings, and
it was only fair to give Elayne her chances to go. That was it.</p>

<p>Carefully she put the box of firesticks into one of
the cabinets, next to two more. The one that had actually caught
fire was long since discarded.</p>

<p>She did not know why she was hiding the truth. Elayne
had obviously not been outside the wagon, or she would know
already. She and Juilin were probably the only people in camp who
did not know, now that Thom had surely revealed every disgusting
detail to Luca.</p>

<p>Taking a deep breath, she sat down on the other bed
and made herself meet Elayne&rsquo;s eyes. Something in the quiet of the
other woman said she knew that more was coming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;asked Cerandin about <em>damane</em> and
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>. I am certain she knows more than she lets on.&rdquo;
She paused for Elayne to voice doubts that she had asked rather
than demanded, to say that the Seanchan woman had already told them
all she knew, that she had not had much contact with
<em>damane</em> or <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>. But Elayne kept silent, and
Nynaeve realized that she was only hoping to postpone the moment
with an argument. &ldquo;She got quite heated about not knowing any more,
so I shook her. You&rsquo;ve really gone too far with her. She waggled
her finger under my nose!&rdquo; Still Elayne only watched her, those
cool blue eyes barely blinking. It was all Nynaeve could do not to
look away as she went on. &ldquo;She&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;threw me, somehow, over her
shoulder. I got up and slapped her, and she knocked me down with
her fist. That is how I got the eye.&rdquo; She might as well tell the
rest; Elayne would hear soon enough; better it came from her. She
would rather have pulled out her tongue. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t about to put up
with that, certainly. We scuffled a little more.&rdquo; Not much of a
scuffle on her part, for all that she had refused to quit. The
bitterest truth was that Cerandin had only stopped flipping her
about and tripping her in sneaky ways because it had been like
manhandling a child. Nynaeve had had as much chance as that child.
If only no one had been watching, so she could have channeled; she
had certainly been angry enough. If only no one had been watching,
period. She wished Cerandin had pounded her with her fists until
she bled. &ldquo;Then Latelle gave her a stick. You know how that woman
wants to get back at me.&rdquo; There was certainly no need to say that
Cerandin had been holding her head down over a wagon tongue at the
time. No one had manhandled her like that since she threw a pitcher
of water at Neysa Ayellin when she was sixteen. &ldquo;Anyway, Petra
broke it up.&rdquo; Just in time, too. The huge man had taken the pair of
them by the scruff of the neck like kittens. &ldquo;Cerandin apologized,
and that was that.&rdquo; Petra had made the Seanchan woman apologize,
true, but he had made Nynaeve do so as well, refusing to loose that
gentle yet iron-hard grip on her neck until she did. She had hit
him as hard as she could, right in the stomach, and he had not even
blinked. Her hand felt as if it might swell, too. &ldquo;Nothing much to
it, really. I suppose Latelle will try to spread some story of her
own making about it. That is the woman I ought to shake. I didn&rsquo;t
hit her half hard enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She felt better for telling the truth, but Elayne had
doubt on her face that made her want to change the subject. &ldquo;What
is that you&rsquo;re hiding?&rdquo; She reached over and pulled the blanket
back, revealing the silvery length of the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> they had
gotten from Cerandin. &ldquo;Why under the Light do you want to look at
that? And if you do, why hide it? It is a filthy thing, and I
cannot understand how you can touch it, but if you want to, that is
entirely up to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sound so prim,&rdquo; Elayne told her. A slow smile
broke across her face, a flush of excitement. &ldquo;I think I could make
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make one!&rdquo; Nynaeve lowered her voice, hoping no one
came running to see who was killing whom, but she did not soften it
any. &ldquo;Light, why? Make an open cesspit first. A midden heap. At
least there&rsquo;s some decent use for those.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not mean to actually make an <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>.&rdquo;
Elayne held herself erect, chin tilted in that cool way of hers.
She sounded offended, and icily calm. &ldquo;But it is a
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, and I have puzzled out how it works. I saw
you attend at least one lecture on linking. The <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>
links the two women; that is why the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> must be a
woman who can channel too.&rdquo; She frowned slightly. &ldquo;It is a strange
link, though. Different. Instead of two or more sharing, with one
guiding, it is one taking full control, really. I think that is the
reason a <em>damane</em> cannot do anything the <em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>
doesn&rsquo;t want her to. I don&rsquo;t really believe there is any need for
the leash. The collar and bracelet would work as well without it,
and in just the same ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Work as well,&rdquo; Nynaeve said dryly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve studied
the matter a great deal for someone who has no intention of making
one.&rdquo; The woman did not even have the grace to blush. &ldquo;What use
would you put it to? I cannot say I would take it amiss if you put
one around Elaida&rsquo;s neck, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it any less
disgus&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo; Elayne broke in, haughtiness
all gone in excitement and fervor. She leaned forward to put a hand
on Nynaeve&rsquo;s knee, and her eyes shone, she was so delighted with
herself. &ldquo;It is a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, Nynaeve. And I think I can
make one.&rdquo; She said each word slowly and deliberately, then laughed
and rushed on. &ldquo;If I can make this one, I can make others. Maybe I
can even make <em>angreal</em> and sa&rsquo;<em>angreal</em>. No one in
the Tower has been able to do that in thousands of years!&rdquo;
Straightening, she shivered, and laid fingers across her mouth. &ldquo;I
never really thought of <em>making</em> anything myself before. Not
anything <em>useful</em>. I remember seeing a craftsman once, a man
who had made some chairs for the palace. They were not gilded, or
elaborately carved&mdash;they were meant for the servants&rsquo; hall&mdash;but I could see the pride in his eyes. Pride in what he had
made, a thing well crafted. I would love to feel that, I think. Oh,
if we only knew a fraction of what the Forsaken do. The knowledge
of the Age of Legends inside their heads, and they use it to serve
the Shadow. Think what we could do with it. Think what we could
make.&rdquo; She took a deep breath, dropping her hands in her lap, her
enthusiasm barely diminished. &ldquo;Well, be that as it may, I&rsquo;ll wager
I could puzzle out how Whitebridge was made, too. Buildings like
spun glass, but stronger than steel. And <em>cuendillar</em>, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slow down,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;Whitebridge is five or
six hundred miles from here at least, and if you think you&rsquo;re going
to go channeling at the seal, you can think again. Who knows what
could happen? It stays in its pouch, in the stove, until we find
somewhere safe for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s eagerness was very odd. Nynaeve would not
have minded a little of the Forsaken&rsquo;s knowledge herself&mdash;far
from it&mdash;but if she wanted a chair, she paid a carpenter. She
had never wanted to make anything, aside from poultices and salves.
When she was twelve, her mother had stopped going through the
motions of teaching her to sew, after it became apparent that she
did not care whether she sewed a straight seam and could not be
made to care. As for cooking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She thought she was a good cook,
actually, but the point was that she knew what was significant.
Healing was important. Any man could build a bridge, and leave him
to it was what she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With you and your <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I
nearly forgot to tell you. Juilin saw Galad on the other side of
the river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood and bloody ashes,&rdquo; Elayne muttered, and when
Nynaeve raised her eyebrows, she added very firmly, &ldquo;I will not
listen to a lecture on my language, Nynaeve. What are we going to
do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I see it, we can remain on this side of the river
and have Whitecloaks looking us over, wondering why we left the
menagerie, or we can cross the bridge and hope the Prophet doesn&rsquo;t
spark a riot and Galad doesn&rsquo;t denounce us, or we can try to buy a
rowboat and flee downriver. Not very good choices. And Luca will
want his hundred marks. Gold.&rdquo; She tried not to scowl, but that
still rankled. &ldquo;You promised it to him, and I suppose it would not
be honest to sneak away without paying him.&rdquo; She would have done it
in a minute if there was anywhere to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly would not be,&rdquo; Elayne said, sounding
shocked. &ldquo;But we do not have to worry about Galad, at least not as
long as we stay close to the menagerie. Galad won&rsquo;t go near one. He
thinks putting animals in cages is cruel. He doesn&rsquo;t mind hunting
them, mind, or eating them, only caging them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve shook her head. The truth was that Elayne
would have found some way to delay, if only for one day, had there
been any way to leave. The woman really wanted to highwalk in front
of people other than the rest of the performers. And she herself
was probably going to have to let Thom throw knives at her again.
<em>I am</em> not <em>wearing that bloody dress, though!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;The first boat that comes large enough to take four
people,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We are hiring it. Trade on the river can&rsquo;t have
stopped altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would help if we knew where we were going.&rdquo; The
other woman&rsquo;s tone was much too gentle. &ldquo;We could simply head for
Tear, you know. We do not have to stay fixed to this just because
you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She trailed off, but Nynaeve knew what she had been
going to say. Just because <em>she</em> was stubborn. Just because
she was so furious that she could not remember a simple name that
she intended to remember it and go there if it killed her. Well,
none of that was true. She intended to find these Aes Sedai who
might just support Rand and bring them to him, not trail into Tear
like a pitiful refugee fleeing for safety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will remember,&rdquo; she said in a level tone. <em>It
