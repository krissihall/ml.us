<h4><em>Over the Border</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">C</span>linging
to her perch at the rear of the jouncing
wagon, Nynaeve used one hand for herself and one for her straw hat
as she peered back at the furious dust storm dwindling behind them
in the distance. The broad brim shaded her face in the morning
heat, but the breeze generated by the wagon&rsquo;s rumbling speed was
enough to snatch it from her head despite the dark red scarf tied
under her chin. Low-hilled grassland with occasional thickets
rolled by, the grass sere and thin in the late-summer heat; dust
churned up by the wagon wheels obscured her vision somewhat, and
made her cough besides. The white clouds in the sky lied. There had
been no rain since before they left Tanchico, weeks earlier, and it
had been some time since the wide road had borne the traffic of
wagons that once kept it hard packed.</p>

<p>No one appeared riding out of that seemingly solid
wall of brown, which was just as well. She had lost her anger at
brigands trying to stop them this close to escaping the madness of
Tarabon, and unless she was angry, she could not sense the True
Source, much less channel. Even angry, she had been surprised at
being able to raise such a storm; once whipped up, full of her
fury, it held a life of its own. Elayne had been startled at the
size of it, too, though thankfully she had not let on to Thom or
Juilin. But even if her strength was increasing&mdash;her teachers
in the Tower had said that it would, and certainly none of them was
strong enough to best one of the Forsaken as she had&mdash;even
with that, she still had that limitation. Had any of the bandits
appeared, Elayne would have had to deal with them alone, and she
did not want that. Her earlier anger was gone, but she was making
fine for another crop.</p>

<p>Awkwardly climbing up over the canvas lashed across
the load of casks, she reached down to one of the water barrels
fastened along the sides of the wagon together with the chests of
their possessions and supplies. Immediately her hat was on the back
of her head, held only by the scarf. Her fingers could just touch
the lid of the barrel, unless she released the rope that she was
gripping with her other hand, and the way the wagon was lurching
along, that would probably send her off onto her nose.</p>

<p>Juilin Sandar guided the lanky brown gelding he was
riding&mdash;Skulker was the improbable name he had put on the
animal&mdash;close to the wagon, and, reached over to hand her one
of the leather water bottles slung about his saddle. She drank
gratefully, though not gracefully. Hanging there like a bunch of
grapes on a windblown vine, she spilled nearly as much water down
the front of her good gray dress as she did down her throat.</p>

<p>It was a suitable dress for a merchant, high-necked,
finely woven and well-cut, but still plain. The pin on her breast,
a small circle of dark garnets in gold, was perhaps too much for a
merchant, but it had been a gift from the panarch of Tarabon, along
with other jewelry, much richer, hidden in a compartment beneath
the wagon driver&rsquo;s seat. She wore it to remind herself that even
women who sat on thrones sometimes needed to be taken by the scruff
of the neck and shaken. She had a little more sympathy for the
Tower&rsquo;s manipulations of kings and queens now that she had dealt
with Amathera.</p>

<p>She suspected that Amathera had meant her gifts as a
bribe to make them depart Tanchico. The woman had been willing to
buy a ship so that they would not remain an hour more than
necessary, but no one had been willing to sell. The few vessels
remaining in Tanchico Harbor that were suitable for more than
coasting had been jammed with refugees. Besides, a ship was the
obvious way, the fastest way, to leave, and the Black Ajah might
well be watching for her and Elayne, after what had happened. They
had been sent to hunt Aes Sedai who were Darkfriends, not to be
ambushed by them. Thus the wagon and the long trek across a land
torn by civil war and anarchy. She was beginning to wish she had
not insisted on avoiding the ships. Not that she would ever admit
it to the others.</p>

<p>When she tried to hand the water bottle back to
Juilin, he waved it away. A tough man, seemingly carved from some
dark wood, he was not very comfortable on the back of a horse. He
looked ridiculous to her; not because of his obvious ill ease in
the saddle, but for the silly red Taraboner hat that he had taken
to wearing on his flat, black hair, a brimless, conical thing, tall
and flat-topped. It did not go well with his dark Tairen coat,
tight to the waist, then flaring. She did not think it would go
well with anything. In her opinion, he looked as if he were wearing
a cake on his head.</p>

<p>It was clumsy scrambling the rest of the way forward
with the leather bottle in one hand and her hat flapping, and she
did it muttering imprecations for the Tairen thief-catcher&mdash;<em>Never thief-taker, not him!</em>&mdash;for Thom Merrilin&mdash;<em>Puffed-up gleeman!</em>&mdash;and for Elayne of House
Trakand, Daughter-Heir of Andor, who ought to be shaken by the
scruff of the neck herself!</p>

<p>She meant to slide onto the wooden driver&rsquo;s seat
between Thom and Elayne, but the golden-haired girl was pressed
tightly against Thom, her own straw hat hanging on her back. She
was clutching the white mustached old fool&rsquo;s arm as if afraid of
falling off. Tight-mouthed, Nynaeve had to settle for Elayne&rsquo;s
other side. She was glad she had her hair in one proper braid
again, wrist-thick and hanging down to her waist; she could give it
a tug instead of thumping Elayne&rsquo;s ear for her. The girl had used
to seem reasonably sensible, but something seemed to have addled
her wits in Tanchico.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t following us anymore,&rdquo; Nynaeve
announced, pulling her hat back into place. &ldquo;You can slow this
thing down now, Thom.&rdquo; She could have shouted that from the back
and not needed to clamber over the casks, but the image of herself
bouncing about and calling for them to slow had stopped her. She
did not like making a fool of herself, and liked even less others
seeing her in a foolish light. &ldquo;Put your hat on,&rdquo; she told Elayne.
&ldquo;That fair skin of yours will not appreciate this sun for
long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she had half-expected, the girl ignored her
friendly advice. &ldquo;You drive so wonderfully,&rdquo; Elayne gushed as Thom
drew back on the reins, pulling the four-horse team to a walk. &ldquo;You
were in control every minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tall, wiry man glanced down at her, bushy white
eyebrows twitching, but all he said was, &ldquo;We have more company
ahead, child.&rdquo; Well, maybe he was not such a fool.</p>

<p>Nynaeve looked, and saw the snowy-cloaked mounted
column approaching them over the next low rise, perhaps half a
hundred men in burnished mail and shining conical helmets,
escorting as many heavily laden wagons. Children of the Light. She
was suddenly very conscious of the leather thong hanging around her
neck beneath her dress, and the two rings dangling between her
breasts. Lan&rsquo;s heavy gold signet ring, the ring of the Kings of
lost Malkier, would mean nothing to the Whitecloaks, but if they
saw the Great Serpent ring&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Fool woman! They aren&rsquo;t likely to, unless you
decide to undress!</em></p>

<p>Hastily she ran an eye over her companions. Elayne
could not stop being beautiful, and now that she had let go of Thom
and was retying the green scarf that held her hat, her manner
looked more suited to a throne room than a merchant&rsquo;s wagon, but
aside from being blue, her dress was no different from Nynaeve&rsquo;s.
She wore no jewelry; she had called Amathera&rsquo;s gifts &ldquo;gaudy.&rdquo; She
would pass; she had done so fifty times since Tanchico. Barely.
Only, this was the first meeting with Whitecloaks. Thom, in stout
brown wool, could have been any of a thousand gnarled, white-haired
men who worked wagons. And Juilin was Juilin. He knew how to
behave, though he looked as though he wished he were sure footed on
the ground, with his staff or the slotted sword-breaker he wore at
his belt, rather than on a horse.</p>

<p>Thom drew the team over to one side of the road and
halted as several Whitecloaks broke away from the head of the
column. Nynaeve put on a welcoming smile. She hoped they had not
decided that they needed another wagon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light illumine you, Captain,&rdquo; she said to the
narrow-faced man who was obviously the leader, the only one not
carrying a steel-tipped lance. She had no idea what rank the two
golden knots signified on the breast of his cloak, right below the
flaring sunburst they all wore, but in her experience men would
accept any flattery. &ldquo;We are very glad to see you. Bandits tried to
rob us a few miles back, but a dust storm appeared like a miracle.
We barely esc&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a merchant? Few merchants have come out of
Tarabon in some time.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s voice was as harsh as his face,
and that looked as though all joy had been boiled out of it before
he left the cradle. Suspicion filled his dark, deep-set eyes;
Nynaeve did not doubt that was permanent, too. &ldquo;Bound to where,
with what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I carry dyes, Captain.&rdquo; She worked to maintain her
smile under that steady, unblinking stare; it was a relief when he
shifted it to the others briefly. Thom was making a good job of
appearing bored, just a wagon driver who would be paid stopped or
moving, and if Juilin had not snatched off that ridiculous hat as
he once would have, at least he seemed no more than idly
interested, a hired man with nothing to hide. When the Whitecloak&rsquo;s
gaze dropped to Elayne, Nynaeve felt the other woman stiffen, and
hurried on. &ldquo;Taraboner dyes. The finest in the world. I can get a
good price for them in Andor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At a signal from the captain&mdash;or whatever he
was&mdash;one of the other Whitecloaks heeled his horse to the
back of the wagon. Slicing one of the ropes with his dagger, he
jerked some of the canvas loose, enough to expose three or four
casks. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re branded &lsquo;Tanchico,&rsquo; Lieutenant. This one says
&lsquo;crimson.&rsquo; Do you want me to break open a few?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve hoped the Whitecloak officer took the anxiety
on her face the right way. Even without looking at her, she could
all but feel Elayne wanting to call the soldier down for his
manners, but any real merchant would be worried at having dyes
exposed to the elements. &ldquo;If you will show me the ones you want
opened, Captain, I will be more than happy to do it myself.&rdquo; The
man showed no response at all, to flattery or offers of
cooperation. &ldquo;The casks were sealed to keep out dust and water, you
see. If the cask head is broken, I&rsquo;ll never be able to cover it
over with wax again here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rest of the column reached them and began to pass
in a cloud of dust; the wagon drivers were roughly dressed,
nondescript men, but the soldiers rode stiffly erect, their long
steel lance points all slanted at exactly the same angle. Even
sweaty-faced and coated with dust, they looked hard men. Only the
drivers glanced at Nynaeve and the others.</p>

<p>The Whitecloak lieutenant waved dust away from his
face with one gauntleted hand, then motioned the man back from the
wagon. His eyes never left Nynaeve. &ldquo;You come from Tanchico?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve nodded, a picture of cooperation and
openness. &ldquo;Yes, Captain. Tanchico.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What word have you of the city? There have been
rumors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rumors, Captain? When we left, there was little
order remaining. The city was full of refugees, and the countryside
of rebels and bandits. Trade hardly exists.&rdquo; That was the truth,
pure and simple. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why these dyes will fetch particularly
good prices. There will be no more Taraboner dyes available for a
long while, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not care about refugees, trade or dyes,
merchant,&rdquo; the officer said in flat tones. &ldquo;Was Andric still on the
throne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Captain.&rdquo; Obviously, rumor said someone had
taken Tanchico and supplanted the King, and perhaps someone had.
But who&mdash;one of the rebel lords who fought each other as hard
as they did Andric, or the Dragonsworn who had pledged themselves
to the Dragon Reborn without ever seeing him? &ldquo;Andric was still
King, and Amathera still Panarch, when we left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eyes said she could be lying. &ldquo;It is said the Tar
Valon witches were involved. Did you see any Aes Sedai, or hear of
them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Captain,&rdquo; she said quickly. The Great Serpent
ring seemed hot against her skin. Fifty Whitecloaks, close at hand.
A dust storm would not help this time, and anyway, though she tried
to deny it, she was more scared than angry. &ldquo;Plain merchants don&rsquo;t
mingle with that sort.&rdquo; He nodded, and she risked adding a
question. Anything to change the subject. &ldquo;If you please, Captain,
have we entered Amadicia yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The border is five miles east,&rdquo; he pronounced. &ldquo;For
the time being. The first village you come to will be Mardecin.
Obey the law, and you will be well. There is a garrison of the
Children there.&rdquo; He sounded as if the garrison would spend all of
its time making sure they did obey the law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you come to move the border?&rdquo; Elayne asked
suddenly and coolly. Nynaeve could have strangled her.</p>

<p>The deep-set, suspicious eyes shifted to Elayne, and
Nynaeve said hastily, &ldquo;Forgive her, my Lord Captain. My eldest
sister&rsquo;s girl. She thinks she should have been born a lady, and she
can&rsquo;t keep away from the boys besides. That&rsquo;s why her mother sent
her to me.&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s indignant gasp was perfect. It was also
probably quite real. Nynaeve supposed she had not needed to add
that about boys, but it seemed to fit.</p>

<p>The Whitecloak stared at them a moment longer, then
said, &ldquo;The Lord Captain Commander sends food into Tarabon.
Otherwise, we would have Taraboner vermin over the border and
stealing anything they could chew. Walk in the Light,&rdquo; he added
before swinging his horse to gallop back to the head of the column.
It was neither suggestion nor blessing.</p>

<p>Thom got the wagon moving as soon as the officer
left, but everyone sat silent, except for coughing, until they were
well beyond the last soldier and out of the other wagons&rsquo; dust.</p>

<p>Swallowing a little water to wet her throat, Nynaeve
pushed the water bottle at Elayne. &ldquo;What did you mean back there?&rdquo;
she demanded. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t in your mother&rsquo;s throne room, and your
mother would not stand for it anyway!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne emptied the rest of the leather bottle before
deigning to reply. &ldquo;You were crawling, Nynaeve.&rdquo; She pitched her
voice high, in a mock servility. &ldquo;I am very good and obedient,
Captain. May I kiss your boots, Captain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are supposed to be merchants, not queens in
disguise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merchants do not have to be lickspittles! You are
lucky he didn&rsquo;t think we were trying to hide something, acting so
servile!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t stare down their noses at Whitecloaks
with fifty lances, either! Or did you think we could overwhelm them
all with the Power, if need be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you tell him I could not keep away from
boys? There was no need for that, Nynaeve!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was ready to tell him anything that would make him
go away and leave us alone! And you&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both of you shut up,&rdquo; Thom barked suddenly, &ldquo;before
they come back to see which of you is murdering the other!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve actually twisted around on the wooden seat to
look back before she realized the Whitecloaks were too far off to
hear even if they had been shouting. Well, maybe they had been. It
did not help that Elayne did the same.</p>

<p>Nynaeve took a firm hold on her braid and glared at
Thom, but Elayne snuggled herself against his arm and practically
cooed, &ldquo;You are right, Thom. I am sorry I raised my voice.&rdquo; Juilin
was watching them sideways, pretending not to, but he was wise
enough not to bring his horse close enough to become part of
it.</p>

<p>Letting go of her braid before she pulled it out by
the roots, Nynaeve adjusted her hat and sat staring straight ahead
over the horses. Whatever had gotten into the girl, it was high
time to get it out again.</p>

<p>Only a tall stone pillar to each side of the road
marked the border between Tarabon and Amadicia. There was no
traffic on the road but them. The hills gradually became a little
higher, but otherwise the land remained much the same, brown grass
and thickets with few green leaves except on pine or leatherleaf or
other evergreens. Stone-fenced fields and thatch-roofed stone
farmhouses dotted the slopes and dells, but they had a look of
abandonment. No smoke rising from chimneys, no men working crops,
no sheep or cows. Sometimes a few chickens scratched in a farmyard
near the road, but they scurried away, gone feral, at the wagon&rsquo;s
approach. Whitecloak garrison or no, apparently no one was willing
to risk Taraboner brigands this close to the border.</p>

<p>When Mardecin appeared, from the top of a rise, the
sun still had a long way to climb to its zenith. The town ahead
looked too big for the name of village, nearly a mile across,
straddling a small bridged stream between two hills, with as many
slate roofs as thatched, and considerable bustle in the wide
streets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need to buy supplies,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, &ldquo;but we want
to be quick about it. We can cover a lot of ground yet before
nightfall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are wearing out, Nynaeve,&rdquo; Thom said. &ldquo;First
light to last light every day for nearly a month. One day resting
will not make much difference in reaching Tar Valon.&rdquo; He did not
sound tired. More likely he was looking forward to playing his harp
or his flute in one of the taverns and getting men to buy him
wine.</p>

<p>Juilin had finally brought his mount close to the
wagon, and he added, &ldquo;I could do with a day on my feet. I do not
know whether this saddle or that wagon seat is worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we should find an inn,&rdquo; Elayne said, looking
up at Thom. &ldquo;I have had quite enough of sleeping under this wagon,
and I would like to listen to you tell stories in the common
room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One-wagon merchants are little more than peddlers,&rdquo;
Nynaeve said sharply. &ldquo;They cannot afford inns in a town like
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not know whether that was true or not, but
despite her own desire for a bath and clean sheets, she was not
going to let the girl get away with directing the suggestion at
Thom. It was not until the words were out of her mouth that she
realized that she had given in to Thom and Juilin. <em>One day
won&rsquo;t hurt. It&rsquo;s a long way to Tar Valon yet</em>.</p>

<p>She wished she had insisted on a ship. With a fast
ship, a Sea Folk raker, they could have gotten to Tear in a third
of what it had taken them to cross Tarabon, as long as they had
good winds, and with the right Atha&rsquo;an Miere Windfinder that would
have been no problem; she or Elayne could have handled it, for that
matter. The Tairens knew that she and Elayne were friends of
Rand&rsquo;s, and she expected that they still sweated buckets for fear
of offending the Dragon Reborn; they would have provided a carriage
and escort for the journey up to Tar Valon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Find us a place to camp,&rdquo; she said reluctantly. She
should have insisted on a ship. They might have been back in the
Tower by now.</p>
