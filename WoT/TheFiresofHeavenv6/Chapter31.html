<h4><em>The Far Snows</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
streets of Eianrod ran straight and met at right
angles, where necessary slicing through hills that were otherwise
neatly terraced with stone. The slate-roofed stone buildings had an
angular look, as if they were all vertical lines. Eianrod had not
fallen to Couladin; no people had been there when the Shaido swept
through. A good many of the houses were only charred beams and
hollow ruined shells, however, including most of the wide
three-story marble buildings with balconies that Moiraine said had
belonged to merchants. Broken furniture and clothes littered the
streets, along with shattered dishes and shards of glass from
windows, single boots and tools and toys.</p>

<p>The burning had come at different times&mdash;Rand
could tell that much himself, from the weathering of blackened
timbers and how much smell of char lingered where&mdash;but Lan
had been able to chart the flow of battles by which the town had
been taken and retaken. By different Houses contending for the Sun
Throne, most likely, though from the look of the streets, the last
to hold Eianrod had been brigands. A good many of the bands roaming
Cairhien held allegiance to no one, and to nothing except gold.</p>

<p>It was to one of the merchants&rsquo; houses that Rand
went, on the largest of the town&rsquo;s two squares, three square
stories of gray marble with heavy balconies and wide steps with
thick angular stone side-rails overlooking a silent fountain with a
dusty round basin. A chance to sleep in a bed again had been too
good to pass up, and he had hopes that Aviendha would choose to
remain in a tent; whether his or with the Wise Ones, he did not
care, so long as he did not have to try going to sleep while
listening to her breathe a few paces away. Recently he had begun
imagining he could hear her heart beat even when he had not taken
hold of <em>saidin</em>. But if she did not stay away, he had taken
precautions.</p>

<p>The Maidens stopped at the steps, some trotting
around the building to take positions on all sides. He had feared
that they would try declaring this a Roof of the Maidens, even for
the one night, and so as soon as he had chosen the building, one of
the few in town with a sound roof and most of the windows unbroken,
he had told Sulin that he was declaring it the Roof of the
Winespring Brothers. No one could enter who had not drunk from the
Winespring, in Emond&rsquo;s Field. From the look she had given him, she
knew very well what he was up to, but none of them followed him
beyond the wide doors that seemed to be all narrow vertical
panels.</p>

<p>Inside, the large rooms were bare, though white-robed
<em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> had spread a few blankets for themselves in the
broad entry hall, its high plaster ceiling worked in a pattern of
severe squares. Keeping <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> out was beyond him even
had he wanted to, as much so as keeping Moiraine out if she was not
asleep elsewhere. Whatever orders he gave about not being
disturbed, she always found a way to make the Maidens let her by,
and it always took a direct command for her to go before she would
leave.</p>

<p>The <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> rose smoothly, men and women,
before he had the door closed. They would not sleep until he did,
and some would take turns remaining awake in case he wanted
something in the night. He had tried ordering them not to, but
telling a <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> not to serve according to custom was
like kicking a bale of wool; whatever impression you made was gone
as soon as your toes were. He waved them away and climbed the
marble stairs. Some of those <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> had salvaged a few
bits of furniture, including a bed and two feather mattresses, and
he was looking forward to washing and&mdash;</p>

<p>He froze as soon as he opened the door to his
bedchamber. Aviendha had not chosen to remain with the tents. She
stood before the washstand, with its mismatched, cracked bowl and
pitcher, a cloth in one hand and a bar of yellow soap in the other.
She had no clothes on. She seemed as stunned as he, as incapable of
moving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She stopped to swallow, big green eyes
locked on his face. &ldquo;I could not make a sweat tent here in this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;town, so I thought I would try your way of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was hard muscle and soft curves; she glistened
damply from head to feet. He had never imagined that her legs were
so long. &ldquo;I thought you would remain longer at the bridge. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
Her voice rose in pitch; her eyes widened in panic. &ldquo;I did not
arrange for you to see me! I must get away from you. As far away as
I can! I must!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly a shimmering vertical line appeared in the
air near her. It widened, as if rotating, into a gateway. Icy wind
rushed through it into the room, carrying thick curtains of
snow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must get away!&rdquo; she wailed, and darted through
into the blizzard.</p>

<p>Immediately the gateway began to narrow again,
turning, but without thought Rand channeled, blocking it at half
its former width. He did not know what he had done or how, but he
was sure this was a gateway for Traveling, such as Asmodean had
told him of and been unable to teach him. There was no time for
thinking. Wherever Aviendha had gone, she had gone naked into the
heart of a winter storm. Rand tied off the flows he had woven as he
ripped all the blankets from the bed and tossed them onto her
clothes and pallet. Seizing blankets, clothes and rugs all
together, he plunged through only moments behind her.</p>

<p>Icy wind screamed through night air filled with
swirling white. Even wrapped in the Void, he could feel his body
shivering. Dimly he could make out scattered shapes in the
darkness; trees, he thought. There was nothing for him to smell but
cold. Ahead of him, a form moved, obscured by darkness and the
snowstorm; he might have missed it but for the sharpness of his
eyes in the Void. Aviendha, running as hard as she could. He
lumbered after her through snow to his knees, clutching the thick
bundle to his chest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aviendha! Stop!&rdquo; He was afraid that the howling wind
would sweep his shout away, but she heard. And if anything, ran
faster. He forced himself to more speed, staggering and tripping as
the deepening snow tugged at his boots. The prints left by her bare
feet were filling fast. If he lost sight of her in this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;Stop, you fool woman! Are you trying to kill yourself?&rdquo; The sound
of his voice seemed to flog her to run harder.</p>

<p>Grimly, he pushed himself, half-falling and
scrambling back up, knocked down by the hurtling wind as often as
stumbling in the snow, blundering into trees. He had to keep his
eyes on her. He was only thankful this forest, or whatever it was,
had trees so far apart.</p>

<p>Plans skittered across the Void and were discarded.
He could try quelling the storm&mdash;and maybe the result would
turn the air to ice. A shelter of Air to keep the falling snow away
would do nothing for that underfoot. He could melt a path for
himself with Fire&mdash;and slog through mud instead. Unless&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He channeled, and the snow ahead of him melted in a
band a span wide, a band that ran ahead of him as he did. Steam
rose, and falling snow vanished a foot above the sandy soil. He
could feel the heat of it through his boots. Down almost to his
ankles, his body shook with the bone-chilling cold; his feet
sweated and flinched away from the heated ground. But he was
catching up now. Another five minutes and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suddenly the vague shape he had been following
vanished as if she had fallen into a hole.</p>

<p>Keeping his eyes fixed on the spot where he had last
seen her, he ran as hard as he could. Abruptly he was splashing in
icy flowing water to his ankles, halfway to his knees. Ahead of
him, the melting snow revealed more, and an edge of ice inching
slowly back. No steam rose from the black water. Stream or river,
it was too big for the amount of his channeling to warm the
swift-moving flow even a hair. She must have run out onto the ice
and fallen through, but he would not save her by trying to wade
into this. Filled with <em>saidin</em>, he was barely aware of the
cold, but his teeth chattered uncontrollably.</p>

<p>Retreating to the bank, gaze locked on where he
thought Aviendha had gone down, he channeled flows of Fire into
ground still bare, well back from the stream, until the sand melted
and fused and glowed white. Even in this storm, that would stay hot
for a time. He set the bundle down in the snow beside it&mdash;her
life would depend on finding the blankets and rugs again&mdash;then waded through the deep white to one side of the melted path
and lay flat. Slowly he crawled out onto the snow-covered ice.</p>

<p>The wind shrieked across him. His coat might as well
not have existed. His hands were numb now, and his feet going; he
had stopped shivering except for an occasional shudder. Coldly calm
inside the Void, he knew what was happening; there were blizzards
in the Two Rivers, perhaps even as bad as this. His body was being
overwhelmed. If he did not find warmth soon, he would be able to
calmly watch from the Void as he died. But if he died, Aviendha
would too. If she had not already.</p>

<p>He felt rather than heard the ice cracking beneath
his weight. His probing hands fell into water. This was the place,
but with snow whirling about, he could barely see. He flailed,
searching, numb hands splashing. One hit something at the edge of
the ice, and he commanded his fingers to close, felt frozen hair
crackling.</p>

<p><em>Got to pull her out</em>. He crawled backward,
hauling at her. She was a dead weight, sliding slowly out of the
water. <em>Don&rsquo;t care if the ice scrapes her. Better that than
freezing or drowning. Back. Keep moving. If you quit, she dies.
Keep moving, burn you!</em> Crawling. Pulling with his legs,
pushing with one hand. The other locked in Aviendha&rsquo;s hair; no time
to get a better grip; she could not feel it anyway. <em>You&rsquo;ve had
it easy for too long. Lords kneeling, and</em> gai&rsquo;shain
<em>running to fetch your wine, and Moiraine doing as she&rsquo;s
told</em>. Back. <em>Time to do something yourself if you still
can. Move, you flaming fatherless son of a spavined goat! Keep
moving!</em></p>

<p>Suddenly his feet hurt; the pain began creeping up
his legs. It took him a moment to look back, and then he rolled off
the steaming patch of melted sand. Tendrils of smoke, where his
breeches had begun smoldering, were whisked away by the wind.</p>

<p>Fumbling for the bundle he had left, he swathed
Aviendha from head to foot in all of it, the blankets, the rugs of
her pallet, her clothes. Every bit of protection was vital. Her
eyes were closed, and she did not move. He parted the blankets
enough to put an ear to her chest. Her heart beat so slowly that he
was not sure he was really hearing it. Even four blankets and half
a dozen rugs were not enough, and he could not channel heat into
her as he had the ground; even fining the flow as much as possible,
he was more likely to kill than warm. He could feel the weave he
had used to block open her gateway, a mile or perhaps two away
through the storm. If he tried to carry her that far, neither of
them would survive. They needed shelter, and they needed it
here.</p>

<p>He channeled flows of Air, and snow began to move
across the ground against the wind, building into thick square
walls three paces on a side with one gap for a door, building
higher, compacting the snow till it glistened like ice, roofing it
over high enough to stand. Scooping Aviendha into his arms, he
stumbled into the dark interior, weaving and tying flames dancing
in the corners for light, channeling to scoop more snow to close
the doorway.</p>

<p>Just with the wind shut away it felt warmer, but that
would not be enough. Using the trick Asmodean had shown him, he
wove Air and Fire, and the air around them grew warmer. He did not
dare tie that weave off; if he feel asleep, it could grow and melt
the hut. For that matter, the flames were almost as dangerous to
leave, but he was too bone-weary and chilled to maintain more than
one weave.</p>

<p>The ground inside had been cleared as he built, bare
sandy soil with only a few brown leaves he did not recognize and
some scruffy low dead weeds that were equally strange to him.
Releasing the weave that warmed the air, he heated the ground
enough to take away the iciness, then took up the other weave
again. It was all he could do to lay Aviendha down gently rather
than drop her.</p>

<p>He pushed a hand inside the blankets to feel her
cheek, her shoulder. Trickles of water ran across her face as her
hair melted. He was cold, but she was ice. She needed every scrap
of warmth he could find for her, and he did not dare warm the air
more. Already the insides of the walls shone with a faint layer of
melt. However frozen he felt, he had more heat in him than she
did.</p>

<p>Stripping off his clothes, he climbed into the
coverings with her, arranging his own damp garments on the outside;
they could help hold in the body heat. His sense of touch, enhanced
by the Void and <em>saidin</em>, soaked in the feel of her. Her
skin made silk feel rough. Compared to her skin, satin was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Don&rsquo;t think</em>. He smoothed damp hair away from her face. He
should have dried it, but the water no longer felt so cold, and
there was nothing but the blankets or their clothes to use anyway.
Her eyes were closed; her chest stirred against him slowly. Her
head lay on his arm, snuggled against his chest. If she had not
felt like winter itself, she could have been sleeping. So peaceful;
not angry at all. So beautiful. <em>Stop thinking</em>. It was a
sharp command outside the emptiness surrounding him.
<em>Talk</em>.</p>

<p>He tried talking of the first thing that came to
mind, Elayne and the confusion her two letters brought, but that
soon had thoughts of golden-haired Elayne drifting across the Void,
of kissing her in secluded spots in the Stone. <em>Don&rsquo;t think of
kissing, fool!</em> He shifted to Min. He had never thought about
Min that way. Well, a few dreams could not count. Min would have
slapped his face if he had ever tried to kiss her, or else laughed
and called him a wool-head. Only it seemed that speaking of any
woman reminded him that he had his arms around a woman who had no
clothes on. Filled with the Power, he could smell the scent of her,
feel every inch of her as clearly as if he were running his hands&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The Void trembled. <em>Light, you&rsquo;re only trying to warm her!
Keep your mind out of the pigsty, man!</em></p>

<p>Trying to drive thought away, he talked of his hopes
for Cairhien, to bring peace and an end to the famine, to bring the
nations behind him without any more bloodshed. But that had its own
life, too, its own inevitable path, to Shayol Ghul, where he must
face the Dark One and die, if the Prophecies were true. It seemed
cowardly to say that he hoped he might live through that somehow.
Aiel did not know cowardice; the worst of them was brave as a lion.
&ldquo;The Breaking of the World killed the weak,&rdquo; he had heard Bael say,
&ldquo;and the Three-fold Land killed the cowards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He began speaking of where they might be, where she
had brought them with her wild senseless flight. Somewhere far and
strange, to have snow at this time of year. It had been worse than
a senseless flight. Mad. Yet he knew that she had fled from him.
<em>Fled</em> from him. How she must hate him, if she had to flee
as far as she could rather than just tell him to leave her to her
bath in privacy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have knocked.&rdquo; At his own bedroom door? &ldquo;I
know you do not want to be around me. You don&rsquo;t have to be.
Whatever the Wise Ones want, whatever they say, you are going back
to their tents. You will not have to come near me again. In fact,
if you do, I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll send you away.&rdquo; Why hesitate on that? She
gave him anger, coldness, bitterness when she was awake, and asleep&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;It <em>was</em> a crazy thing to do. You could have killed
yourself.&rdquo; He was stroking her hair again; he could not seem to
stop. &ldquo;If you ever do anything half so crazy again, I&rsquo;ll break your
neck. Do you have any idea how I will miss hearing you breathe at
night?&rdquo; Miss it? She drove him crazy with it! He was the one who
was mad. He had to stop this. &ldquo;You are going away, and that&rsquo;s that,
if I have to send you back to Rhuidean. The Wise Ones can&rsquo;t stop me
if I speak as <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>. You won&rsquo;t have to run away from
me again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hand that he could not stop from stroking her
hair froze as she stirred. She was warm, he realized. Very warm. He
should be wrapping one of the blankets about himself decently and
moving away. Her eyes opened, clear and deep green, staring at him
seriously from not a foot away. She did not seem surprised to see
him, and she did not pull back.</p>

<p>He took his arms from around her, started to slither
away, and she seized a handful of his hair in a painful grip. If he
moved, he would have a bald patch. She gave him no chance to
explain anything. &ldquo;I promised my near-sister to watch you.&rdquo; She
seemed to be speaking to herself as much as to him, in a low,
almost expressionless voice. &ldquo;I ran from you as hard as I could, to
shield my honor. And you followed me even here. The rings do not
lie, and I can run no more.&rdquo; Her tone firmed decisively. &ldquo;I will
run no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand tried to ask her what she meant while attempting
to untangle her fingers from his hair, but she clutched another
handful on the other side and pulled his mouth to hers. That was
the end of rational thought; the Void shattered, and
<em>saidin</em> fled. He did not think he could have stopped
himself had he wanted to, only he could not think of wanting to,
and she certainly did not seem to want him to. In fact, the last
thought he had of any coherency for a very long time was that he
did not think he could have stopped <em>her</em>.</p>

<p>Some considerable time later&mdash;two hours, maybe
three; he could hardly be sure&mdash;he lay atop the rugs with the
blankets over him and his hands behind his head, watching Aviendha
examine the slick white walls. They had held a surprising amount of
the warmth; there was no need to latch on to <em>saidin</em> again,
either to shut out cold or to try warming the air. She had done no
more than rake her fingers through her hair on rising, and she
moved completely unashamed at her nakedness. Of course, it was a
bit late to be ashamed of something as small as having no clothes
on. He had been worried about hurting her when dragging her out of
the water, but she showed fewer scrapes than he did, and somehow
they did not seem to mar her beauty at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Snow.&rdquo; He explained what snow was as best he could,
but she only shook her head, partly in wonderment, partly
disbelief. For someone who had grown up in the Waste, frozen water
falling from the sky must seem as impossible as flying. According
to the records, the only time it had ever even rained in the Waste
was the time he had made it.</p>

<p>He could not stop a sigh of regret when she began
pulling her shift over her head. &ldquo;The Wise Ones can marry us as
soon as we get back.&rdquo; He could still feel his weave holding her
gateway open.</p>

<p>Aviendha&rsquo;s dark reddish head popped through the neck
of the shift, and she stared at him flatly. Not unfriendly, but.
not friendly, either. Determined, though. &ldquo;What makes you think a
man has the right to ask me that? Besides, you belong to
Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a moment he managed to close his mouth.
&ldquo;Aviendha, we just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The two of us&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Light, we have to
marry now. Not that I&rsquo;m doing it because I have to,&rdquo; he added
hastily. &ldquo;I want to.&rdquo; He was not sure of that at all, really. He
thought he might love her, but he thought he might love Elayne,
too. And for some reason, Min kept creeping in. <em>You&rsquo;re as big a
lecher as Mat</em>. But for once he could do what was right because
it was right.</p>

<p>She sniffed at him and felt her stockings to be sure
they were dry, then sat down to don them. &ldquo;Egwene has spoken to me
of your Two Rivers marriage customs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to wait a year?&rdquo; he asked
incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The year. Yes, that is what I meant.&rdquo; He had never
realized before how much leg a woman showed pulling on a stocking;
odd that that could seem so thrilling after he had seen her naked
and sweating and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He concentrated on listening to her. &ldquo;Egwene
said she thought of asking her mother&rsquo;s permission for you, but
before she mentioned it her mother told her she had to wait another
year even if she did have her hair in a braid.&rdquo; Aviendha frowned,
one knee almost under her chin. &ldquo;Is that right? She said a girl was
not allowed to braid her hair until she was old enough to marry. Do
you understand what I am saying? You look like that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;fish&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Moiraine caught in the river.&rdquo; There were no fish in the Waste;
Aiel knew them only from books</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; be said. He might as well have been
deaf and blind for all he understood. Shifting under the blankets,
he made himself sound as sure as he could manage. &ldquo;At least&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, the customs are complicated, and I am not certain which part
you are talking about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him suspiciously for a moment, but Aiel
customs were so intricate that she believed him. In the Two Rivers,
you walked out for a year, and if you suited, then you became
betrothed and finally married; that was as far as custom went. She
went on as she dressed. &ldquo;I meant about a girl asking her mother&rsquo;s
permission during the year, and the Wisdom&rsquo;s. I cannot say I
understand that.&rdquo; The white blouse going over her head muffled her
words for a moment. &ldquo;If she wants him, and she is old enough to
marry, why should she need permission? But you see? By my customs,&rdquo;
her tone of voice said they were the only ones that mattered, &ldquo;it
is my place to choose whether to ask you, and I will not. By your
customs,&rdquo; fastening her belt, she shook her head dismissively, &ldquo;I
did not have my mother&rsquo;s permission. And you would need your
father&rsquo;s, I suppose. Or your father-brother&rsquo;s, since your father is
dead? We did not have them, so we cannot marry.&rdquo; She began folding
the scarf to wrap around her forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said weakly. Any boy in the Two Rivers
who asked his father for that kind of permission was asking to have
his ears soundly boxed. When he thought of the lads who had sweated
themselves silly worrying that someone, <em>anyone</em>, would find
out what they were doing with the girl they meant to marry&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;For that matter, he remembered when Nynaeve caught Kimry Lewin and
Bar Dowtry in Bar&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s hayloft. Kimry had had her hair
braided for five years, but when Nynaeve was through with her,
Mistress Lewin had taken over. The Women&rsquo;s Circle had nearly
skinned poor Bar alive, and that was nothing to what they had done
to Kimry over the month they thought was the shortest decent time
to wait for a wedding. The joke told quietly, where it would not
get to the Women&rsquo;s Circle, had been that neither Bar nor Kimry had
been able to sit down the whole first week they were married. Rand
supposed Kimry had failed to ask permission. &ldquo;But I guess Egwene
wouldn&rsquo;t know all the men&rsquo;s customs, after all,&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;Women don&rsquo;t know everything. You see, since I started it, we have
to marry. It doesn&rsquo;t matter about permissions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em> started it?&rdquo; Her sniff was pointed and
meaning. Aiel, Andoran or anything else, women used those noises
like sticks, to prod or thump. &ldquo;It does not matter anyway, since we
are going by Aiel customs. This will not happen again, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo; He was surprised&mdash;and pleased&mdash;to hear regret
in her voice, &ldquo;You belong to the near-sister of my near-sister. I
have <em>toh</em> to Elayne, now, but that is none of your concern.
Are you going to lie there forever? I have heard that men turn
lazy, after, but it cannot be long until the clans are ready to
begin the morning&rsquo;s march. You must be there.&rdquo; Suddenly a stricken
look crossed her face, and she sagged to her knees. &ldquo;If we can
return. I am not certain that I remember what I did to make the
hole, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. You must find our way back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He told her how he had blocked her gateway and could
still feel it holding. She looked relieved, and even smiled at him.
But it became increasingly clear as she folded her legs and
arranged her skirts that she did not mean to turn her back while he
dressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fair&rsquo;s fair,&rdquo; he muttered after a long moment, and
scrambled out of the blankets.</p>

<p>He tried to be as nonchalant as she had been, but it
was not easy. He could feel her eyes like a touch even when he
turned away from her. She had no call to tell him he had a pretty
behind; he had not said anything about how pretty hers was. She
only said it to make him blush, anyway. Women did not look at men
that way. <em>And they don&rsquo;t ask their mother&rsquo;s permission to</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>?</em> He had an idea that life with Aviendha had not
become one bit easier.</p>
