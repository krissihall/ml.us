<h4><em>Dreams of Galad</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">I</span>nstead
of returning to her own body, Egwene floated
in darkness. She seemed to be darkness herself, without substance.
Whether her body lay up or down or sideways from her, she did not
know&mdash;there was no direction here&mdash;but she knew that it
was near, that she could step into it easily. All around her in the
blackness, fireflies seemingly twinkled, a vast horde fading away
into unimaginable distance. Those were dreams, dreams of the Aiel
in the camp, dreams of men and women across Cairhien, across the
world, all glittering there.</p>

<p>She could pick out some among the nearer and name the
dreamer, now. In one way those sparkles were just as alike as
fireflies&mdash;that was what had given her so much trouble in the
beginning&mdash;but in another, somehow, they now seemed as
individual as faces. Rand&rsquo;s dreams, and Moiraine&rsquo;s, appeared muted,
dimmed by the wards they had woven. Amys&rsquo; and Bair&rsquo;s were bright
and regular in their pulsing; they had taken their own advice,
apparently. Had she not seen those, she would have been into her
body in an instant. Those two could rove this darkness much more
ably than she; she would not have known they were there until they
pounced on her. If she ever learned to recognize Elayne and Nynaeve
in the same way, she would be able to find them in that great
constellation wherever they were in the world. But tonight she did
not mean to observe anyone&rsquo;s dream.</p>

<p>Carefully she formed a well-remembered image in her
mind, and she was back in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, inside the
small, windowless room in the Tower where she had lived as a
novice. A narrow bed was built against one white-painted wall. A
washstand and a three-legged stool stood opposite the door, and the
current occupant&rsquo;s dresses and shifts of white wool hung with a
white cloak on pegs. There could as easily have been none; the
Tower had not been able to fill the novices&rsquo; quarters in many
years. The floor was almost as pale as walls and clothes. Every day
the novice who lived there would scrub that floor on hands and
knees; Egwene had done so herself, and Elayne, in the next room. If
a queen came to train in the Tower, she would start in a room like
this, scrubbing the floor.</p>

<p>The garments were arranged differently when she
glanced at them again, but she ignored that. Ready to embrace <em>
saidar</em> in a heartbeat, she opened the door just enough to
stick her head out. And drew a relieved breath when she found
Elayne&rsquo;s head coming just as slowly out of the next doorway. Egwene
hoped she did not appear as wide-eyed and uncertain. She motioned
hurriedly, and Elayne scurried across in novice white that became a
pale gray silk riding dress as she darted inside. Egwene hated gray
dresses; that was what <em>damane</em> wore.</p>

<p>For an instant more she stayed there, scanning the
railed galleries of the novices&rsquo; quarters. Layer on layer they
rose, and fell as many levels to the Novices&rsquo; Court below. Not that
she really expected Liandrin or worse to be out there, but it never
hurt to be careful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought this was what you meant,&rdquo; Elayne said as
she shut the door. &ldquo;Do you have any idea how difficult it is to
remember what I can say in front of whom? Sometimes I wish we could
just tell the Wise Ones everything. Let them know we are only
Accepted, and be done with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would be done with it,&rdquo; Egwene said firmly. &ldquo;I
happen to be sleeping not twenty paces from them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne shivered. &ldquo;That Bair. She reminds me of Lini
when I&rsquo;d broken something I was not supposed to touch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wait until I introduce you to Sorilea.&rdquo; Elayne
gave her a doubtful look, but then, Egwene was not sure that she
would have believed Sorilea herself until she met her. There was no
way to do this easily. She shifted her shawl. &ldquo;Tell me about
meeting Birgitte. It was Birgitte, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne staggered as if hit in the stomach. Her blue
eyes closed for a moment, and she took a breath that must have
filled her to the toes. &ldquo;I cannot talk to you about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean you can&rsquo;t talk? You have a tongue.
Was it Birgitte?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>cannot</em>, Egwene. You must believe me. I
would if I could, but I cannot. Perhaps&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I can ask&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; If
Elayne had been the kind of woman to wring her hands, she would
have been doing it then. Her mouth opened and closed without any
words coming out; her eyes darted around the room as if seeking
inspiration or aid. Taking a deep breath, she fixed an urgent blue
gaze on Egwene. &ldquo;Anything I say violates confidences I promised to
hold. Even that. Please, Egwene. You must trust me. And you must
not tell <em>anyone</em> what you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;think you saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene forced the stern frown from her face. &ldquo;I will
trust you.&rdquo; At least she knew now for a fact that she had not been
seeing things. <em>Birgitte? Light!</em> &ldquo;I hope that one day you
will trust me enough to tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>do</em> trust you, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Shaking her
head, Elayne sat down on the edge of the neatly made bed. &ldquo;We keep
secrets too often, Egwene, but sometimes there is a reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a moment Egwene nodded and sat next to her.
&ldquo;When you can,&rdquo; was all she said, but her friend gave her a
relieved hug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told myself I was not going to ask this, Egwene.
Just once I was not going to have my head full of him.&rdquo; The gray
riding dress became a shimmering green gown; Elayne could not
possibly have been aware of how deeply the neckline swooped. &ldquo;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;is Rand well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is alive and unharmed, if that is what you mean.
I thought he was hard in Tear, but today I heard him threaten to
hang men if they go against his commands. Not that they are bad
orders&mdash;he won&rsquo;t let anyone take food without paying, or
murder people&mdash;but still. They were the first to hail him as
He Who Comes With the Dawn; they followed him out of the Waste
without hesitation. And he threatened them, as hard as cold
steel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a threat, Egwene. He is a king, whatever you or
he or anyone else says, and a king or queen must dispense justice
without fear of enemies or favor for friends. Anyone who does that
has to be hard. Mother can make the city walls seem soft,
sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t have to be so arrogant about it,&rdquo; Egwene
said levelly. &ldquo;Nynaeve said I should remind him he&rsquo;s only a man,
but I&rsquo;ve not figured out how yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He <em>does</em> have to remember he is only a man.
But he has a right to expect to be obeyed.&rdquo; There was something of
a haughty tone to Elayne&rsquo;s voice, until she glanced down at
herself. Then her face went crimson, and the green gown suddenly
had a lace neck under her chin. &ldquo;Are you sure you are not mistaking
that for arrogance?&rdquo; she finished in a strangled voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s as overweening as a pig in a pea field.&rdquo; Egwene
shifted herself on the bed; she remembered it as hard, but the thin
mattress felt softer than what she slept on in the tent. She did
not want to talk about Rand. &ldquo;Are you certain this fight will not
cause more trouble?&rdquo; A feud with this Latelle could not make their
traveling easier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think so. Latelle&rsquo;s grievance against
Nynaeve was that all the unattached men were no longer hers to pick
and choose from. Some women do think that way, I suppose. Aludra
keeps to herself, and Cerandin wouldn&rsquo;t have said boo to a goose
until I started teaching her to stand up for herself, and Clarine
is married to Petra. But Nynaeve has made it clear that she&rsquo;ll box
the ears of any man who even <em>thinks</em> he can flirt with her,
<em>and</em> she apologized to Latelle, so I hope that may settle
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She <em>apologized</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other woman nodded, her face as bemused as Egwene
knew her own must be. &ldquo;I thought she would thump Luca when he told
her she must&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t seem to think her injunction holds
to him, by the way&mdash;but she did it, after grumping about for
an hour. Muttering about you, actually.&rdquo; She hesitated, giving
Egwene a sidelong look. &ldquo;Did you say something to her at your last
meeting? She has been&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;different since then, and sometimes she
talks to herself. Argues, really. About you, from the little I&rsquo;ve
heard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said nothing that did not have to be said.&rdquo; So it
was holding, whatever it was that had happened between them. Either
that, or Nynaeve was storing up her anger for the next time they
met. She was not going to put up with the woman&rsquo;s temper anymore,
not now that she knew she did not have to. &ldquo;You tell her from me
that she is too old to be rolling about on the ground fighting. If
she gets into another, I&rsquo;ll have worse to say to her. You tell her
that exactly. It will be worse.&rdquo; Let Nynaeve chew on that until
next time. Either she would be mild as a lamb&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Or else Egwene
would just have to carry through on her threat. Nynaeve might be
stronger in the Power, when she could channel, but here, Egwene
was. One way or another, she was finished with Nynaeve&rsquo;s
tantrums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell her,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;You have changed,
too. There seems to be something of Rand&rsquo;s attitude about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took Egwene a moment to realize what she meant,
helped by that amused little smile. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne laughed aloud and gave her another hug. &ldquo;Oh,
Egwene, you will be Amyrlin Seat one day, when I am Queen of
Andor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there is a Tower then,&rdquo; Egwene said soberly, and
Elayne&rsquo;s laughter faded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elaida cannot destroy the White Tower, Egwene.
Whatever she does, the Tower will remain. Perhaps she will not stay
Amyrlin. Once Nynaeve remembers the name of that town, I will wager
that we find a Tower in exile, with every Ajah but the Red.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo; Egwene knew she sounded sad. She wanted
Aes Sedai to support Rand and oppose Elaida, but that meant the
White Tower broken for sure, maybe never to be made whole
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must get back,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;Nynaeve insists that
whichever of us does not enter <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> remain
awake, and with her headache, she needs to drink one of her herb
teas and sleep. I do not know why she is so insistent. Whoever is
watching can do nothing to help, and we both know enough to be
perfectly safe here, now.&rdquo; Her green dress flickered to Birgitte&rsquo;s
white coat and voluminous yellow trousers for an instant, then
snapped back. &ldquo;She said I wasn&rsquo;t to tell you this, but she thinks
that Moghedien is trying to find us. Her and me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene did not ask the obvious question. Clearly it
was something that Birgitte had told them. Why did Elayne persist
in trying to keep that secret? <em>Because she promised to. Elayne
never broke a promise in her life</em>. &ldquo;You tell her to be
careful.&rdquo; Small chance that Nynaeve was sitting and waiting, if she
thought one of the Forsaken was after her. She would be remembering
that she had defeated the woman once, and she had always had more
courage than sense. &ldquo;The Forsaken are nothing to take lightly. And
neither are Seanchan, even if they are supposedly just animal
trainers. You tell her that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not suppose you would listen if I told you to
be careful, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave Elayne a startled look. &ldquo;I am always
careful. You know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; The last thing Egwene saw as the other
woman faded away was a very amused smile.</p>

<p>Egwene herself did not go. If Nynaeve could not
remember where that gathering of Blues was, perhaps she could
discover it here. It was hardly a new idea: this was not her first
trip to the Tower since her last meeting with Nynaeve. She put on a
copy of Enaila&rsquo;s face, with flame-colored hair to her shoulders,
and an Accepted&rsquo;s dress with its banded hem, then formed the image
of Elaida&rsquo;s ornately furnished study.</p>

<p>It was as it had been before, though on every visit
fewer of the vine-carved stools stood in that arc in front of the
wide writing table. The paintings still hung above the fireplace.
Egwene strode straight to the table, pushing aside that throne-like
chair with its inlaid ivory Flame of Tar Valon, so she could reach
the lacquered letterbox. Lifting the lid, all fighting hawks and
clouds, she began scanning parchments as fast as she could. Even
so, some melted away half-read, or changed. There was no way to
tell what was important and what insignificant beforehand.</p>

<p>Most seemed reports of failure. Still no word of
where the Lord of Bashere had taken his army, and a note of
frustration and worry tingeing the words. That name tickled the
back of her mind, but with no time to waste she pushed it firmly
away and snatched up another sheet. No word on Rand&rsquo;s whereabouts,
either, said a cringing report filled with near panic. That was
good to know, and worth the trip by itself. More than a month had
passed since the last news from Tanchico by any Ajah&rsquo;s
eyes-and-ears, and others in Tarabon had also gone silent; the
writer blamed the anarchy there; rumors that someone had taken
Tanchico could not be confirmed, but the writer suggested that Rand
himself was involved. Even better, if Elaida was looking in the
wrong place by a thousand leagues. A confused report said that a
Red sister in Caemlyn claimed to have seen Morgase at a public
audience, but various Ajahs&rsquo; agents in Caemlyn said the Queen had
been in seclusion for days. Fighting in the Borderlands, possibly
minor rebellions in Shienar and Arafel; the parchment was gone
before she reached the reason. Pedron Niall calling in Whitecloaks
to Amadicia, possibly to move against Altara. A good thing that
Elayne and Nynaeve had only another three days there.</p>

<p>The next parchment was about Elayne and Nynaeve.
First the writer advised against punishing the agent who had
allowed them to escape&mdash;Elaida had scratched that out in bold
strokes and written &ldquo;Make an example!&rdquo; in the margin&mdash;and
then, just when the woman began to detail the search for the pair
in Amadicia, the single sheet became a fistful, a sheaf of what
seemed to be builders&rsquo; and masons&rsquo; estimates for constructing a
private residence for the Amyrlin Seat on the Tower grounds. More
like a palace, by the number of pages.</p>

<p>She let the pages fall, and they vanished before they
finished scattering across the tabletop. The lacquered box was
closed again. She could spend the rest of her life here, she knew;
there would always be more documents in the box, and they would
always be changing. The more ephemeral something was in the waking
world&mdash;a letter, a piece of clothing, a bowl that might be
frequently moved&mdash;the less firm its reflection in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. She could not remain here too long; sleep
while in the World of Dreams was not as restful as sleep
undisturbed.</p>

<p>Hurrying out to the antechamber, she was about to
reach for the neat piles of scrolls and parchments, some with
seals, on the Keeper&rsquo;s writing table, when the room seemed to
flicker. Before she had time to even consider what that meant, the
door opened, and Galad stepped in, smiling, his brocaded blue coat
fitting his shoulders perfectly, snug breeches showing the shape of
his calves.</p>

<p>She took a deep breath, her stomach fluttering. It
just was not fair for a man to have a face so beautiful.</p>

<p>He stepped closer, dark eyes twinkling, and brushed
her cheek with his fingers. &ldquo;Will you walk with me in the Water
Garden?&rdquo; he said softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you two wish to canoodle,&rdquo; a brisk woman&rsquo;s voice
said, &ldquo;you will not do so here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene spun, wide-eyed, staring at Leane seated
behind the table with the Keeper&rsquo;s stole on her shoulders and a
fond smile on her copper-cheeked face. The door to the Amyrlin&rsquo;s
study was open, and inside Siuan stood beside her simple,
well-polished writing table, reading a long parchment, the striped
stole of office on her shoulders. This was madness.</p>

<p>She fled without thinking of what image she was
forming, and found herself gulping for breath on the Green in
Emond&rsquo;s Field, with the thatch-roofed houses all around, and the
Winespring gushing from the stone outcrop on the broad expanse of
grass. Near the swift, rapidly widening stream stood her father&rsquo;s
small inn, its lower floor stone, the overhanging upper
whitewashed. &ldquo;The only roof like it in the Two Rivers,&rdquo; Bran
al&rsquo;Vere had often said of his red tiles. The large stone foundation
near the Winespring Inn, a huge, spreading oak rising from its
center, was far older than the inn, but some said an inn of some
sort had stood there beside the Winespring Water for more than two
thousand years.</p>

<p><em>Fool</em>. After warning Nynaeve so firmly about
dreams in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, she had nearly let herself be
caught in one of her own. Though it was odd that it had been Galad.
She did dream of him, sometimes. Her face heated; she certainly did
not love him, or even like him very much, but he was beautiful, and
in those dreams he had been much more what she could have wished
him. It was his brother Gawyn that she dreamed of more often, but
that was just as silly. Whatever Elayne said, he had never made any
feelings known to her.</p>

<p>It was that fool book, with all those tales of
lovers. As soon as she woke in the morning she was going to give
the thing back to Aviendha. And tell her that she did not think
that she read it for the adventures at all.</p>

<p>She was reluctant to leave, though. Home. Emond&rsquo;s
Field. The last place that she had really felt safe. More than a
year and a half had passed since she last saw it, yet everything
seemed as she remembered. Not quite everything. On the Green stood
two tall poles with large banners, one a red eagle, the other an
equally red wolf&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>Had Perrin anything to do with those? She could not
imagine how. Yet he had come home, so Rand said, and she had
dreamed of him with wolves more than once.</p>

<p>Enough idle standing about. It was time to&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Flicker</em>.</p>

<p>Her mother stepped out of the inn, graying braid
pulled over one shoulder. Marin al&rsquo;Vere was a slim woman, still
handsome, and the best cook in the Two Rivers. Egwene could hear
her father laughing inside the common room, where he was meeting
with the rest of the Village Council.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you still out here, child?&rdquo; her mother said,
gently chiding and amused. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve certainly been married long
enough to know you shouldn&rsquo;t let your husband know you mope about
waiting on him.&rdquo; With a shake of her head, she laughed. &ldquo;Too late.
Here he comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene turned eagerly, eyes darting past the children
playing on the Green. The timbers of the low Wagon Bridge thrummed
as Gawyn galloped across and swung down from his saddle in front of
her. Tall and straight in his gold-embroidered red coat, he had his
sister&rsquo;s red-gold curls, and marvelous deep blue eyes. He was not
so handsome as his half-brother, of course, but her heart beat
faster for him than it had for Galad&mdash;for Galad? What?&mdash;and she had to press her hands to her stomach in a vain
attempt to still gigantic butterflies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you miss me?&rdquo; he said, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little.&rdquo; <em>Why did I think of Galad? As if I&rsquo;d
just seen him a moment ago</em>. &ldquo;Now and then, when there was
nothing interesting to occupy my time. Did you miss me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For answer, he pulled her off her feet and kissed
her. She was not aware of very much else until he set her back down
on unsteady legs. The banners were gone. <em>What banners?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Here he is,&rdquo; her mother said, approaching with a
babe wrapped in swaddling. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your son. He is a fine boy. He
never cries at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gawyn laughed as he took the child, held him aloft.
&ldquo;He does have your eyes, Egwene. He will be a fine one with the
girls one day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene backed away from them, shaking her head. There
<em>had</em> been banners, red eagle and red wolf&rsquo;s head. She <em>
had</em> seen Galad. In the Tower. &ldquo;N0000000!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She fled, leaping from <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> to her
own body. Awareness remained only long enough for her to wonder how
she could possibly have been fool enough to let her own fancies
nearly trap her, and then she was deep in her own safe dream. Gawyn
galloped across the Wagon Bridge, swinging down&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Stepping out from behind a thatch-roofed house,
Moghedien wondered idly where this little village was. Not the sort
of place she would expect to see banners flying. The girl had been
stronger than she had thought, to escape her weaving of <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. Even Lanfear could not improve on her
abilities here, whatever she claimed. Still, the girl had just been
of interest because she was speaking to Elayne Trakand, who might
lead her to Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara. The only reason to trap her had
simply been to rid <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> of one who could walk it
freely. It was bad enough that she must share it with Lanfear.</p>

<p>But Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara. That woman she meant to make
beg to be bound in her service. She would take her in the flesh,
perhaps ask the Great Lord to grant her immortality, so Nynaeve
could have forever to regret opposing Moghedien. She and Elayne
were scheming with Birgitte, were they? That was another she had
reason to punish. Birgitte had not even known who Moghedien was, so
long ago, in the Age of Legends, when she foiled Moghedien&rsquo;s finely
wrought plan to lay Lews Therin by his heels. But Moghedien had
known her. Only, Birgitte&mdash;Teadra, she had been then&mdash;had died before she could deal with her. Death was no punishment,
no end, not when it meant living on here.</p>

<p>Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara, Elayne Trakand, and Birgitte. Those
three she would find, and deal with. From the shadows<em>,</em> so
that they would not know until too late. All three, without
exception.</p>

<p>She vanished, and the banners waved on in the breeze
of <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.</p>
