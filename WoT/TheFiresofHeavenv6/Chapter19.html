<h4><em>Memories</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">M</span>y Queen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morgase looked up from the book on her lap. Sunlight
slanted through the window of the sitting room next to her
bedchamber. The day was already hot, with no breeze, and sweat
dampened her face. It would be noon before much longer, and she had
not stirred from the room. That was unlike her; she could not
remember why she had decided to laze the morning away with a book.
She seemed unable to concentrate on reading of late. By the golden
clock on the mantel above the marble fireplace, an hour had passed
since she last turned a page, and she could not recall its words.
It must be the heat.</p>

<p>The red-coated young officer of her Guards, kneeling
with one fist pressed to the red-and-gold carpet, looked vaguely
familiar. Once she had known the name of every Guard assigned to
the Palace. Perhaps it was all the new faces. &ldquo;Tallanvor,&rdquo; she
said, surprising herself. He was a tall, well-made young man, but
she could not tell why she remembered him in particular. Had he
brought someone to her once? Long ago? &ldquo;Guardsman Lieutenant Martyn
Tallanvor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He glanced at her, startlingly rough-eyed, before
putting his gaze back on the carpet. &ldquo;My Queen, forgive me, but I
am surprised that you remain here, given the morning&rsquo;s news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What news?&rdquo; It would be good to learn something
besides Alteima&rsquo;s gossip of the Tairen court. At times she felt
that there was something else she wanted to ask the woman, but all
they ever did was gossip, which she could never remember doing
before. Gaebril seemed to enjoy listening to them, sitting in that
tall chair in front of the fireplace with his ankles crossed,
smiling contentedly. Alteima had taken to wearing rather daring
dresses; Morgase would have to say something to her. Dimly she
seemed to remember thinking that before. <em>Nonsense. If I had, I
would have spoken to her already</em>. She shook her head,
realizing that she had drifted away from the young officer
entirely, that he had begun speaking and stopped when he saw she
was not listening. &ldquo;Tell me again. I was distracted. And
stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rose, face angry, eyes burning on her before they
dropped again. She looked where he had been staring and blushed;
her dress was cut extremely low. But Gaebril liked her to wear them
so. With that thought she ceased fretting about being nearly naked
in front of one of her officers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be brief,&rdquo; she said curtly. <em>How dare he look at
me in that manner? I should have him flogged</em>. &ldquo;What news is so
important that you think you can walk into my sitting room as if it
were a tavern?&rdquo; His face darkened, but whether from proper
embarrassment or increased anger she could not say. <em>How dare he
be angry with his queen! Does the man think all I have to do is
listen to him?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Rebellion, my Queen,&rdquo; he said in a flat tone, and
all thought of anger and stares vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Two Rivers, my Queen. Someone has raised the old
banner of Manetheren, the Red Eagle. A messenger came from
Whitebridge this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morgase drummed her fingers on the book, her thoughts
coming more clearly than it seemed they had in a very long time.
Something about the Two Rivers, some spark she could not quite fan
to life, tugged at her. The region was hardly part of Andor at all,
and had not been for generations. She and the last three queens
before her had been hard pressed to maintain a modicum of control
over the miners and smelters in the Mountains of Mist, and even
that modicum would have been lost had there been any way to get the
metals out save through the rest of Andor. A choice between holding
the mines&rsquo; gold and iron and other metals and keeping the Two
Rivers&rsquo; wool and tabac had not been difficult. But rebellion
unchecked, even rebellion in a part of her realm that she ruled
only on a map, could spread like wildfire, to places that were hers
in fact. And Manetheren, destroyed in the Trolloc Wars, Manetheren
of legend and story, still had a hold on some men&rsquo;s minds. Besides,
the Two Rivers was hers. If they had been left to go their own way
for far too long, they were still a part of her realm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Lord Gaebril been informed?&rdquo; Of course he had
not. He would have come to her with the news, and suggestions on
how to deal with it. His suggestions were always clearly right.
<em>Suggestions?</em> Somehow, it seemed that she could remember
him telling her what to do. That was impossible, of course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has, my Queen.&rdquo; Tallanvor&rsquo;s voice was still
bland, unlike his face, where slow anger yet smoldered. &ldquo;He
laughed. He said the Two Rivers seemed to throw up trouble, and he
would have to do something about it one day. He said this minor
annoyance would have to wait its turn behind more important
matters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The book fell as she sprang to her feet, and she
thought Tallanvor smiled in grim satisfaction as she swept by him.
A serving woman told her where Gaebril was to be found, and she
marched straight to the colonnaded court, with its marble fountain,
the basin full of lily pads and fish&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It was cooler there, and
shaded a little.</p>

<p>Gaebril sat on the broad white coping of the
fountain, lords and ladies gathered around him. She recognized
fewer than half. Dark square-faced Jarid of House Sarand, and his
shrewish honey-haired wife, Elenia. That simpering Arymilla of
House Marne, melting brown eyes always so wide in feigned interest,
and bony, goat-faced Nasin of House Caeren, who would tumble any
woman he could corner despite his thin white hair. Naean of House
Arawn, as usual with a sneer marring her pale beauty, and Lir of
House Baryn, a whip of a man, wearing a sword of all things, and
Karind of House Anshar, with the same flat-eyed stare that some
said had put three husbands under the ground. The others she did
not know at all, which was strange enough, but these she never
allowed into the Palace except on state occasions. Every one had
opposed her during the Succession. Elenia and Naean had wanted the
Lion Throne for themselves. What could Gaebril be thinking to
actually bring them here?</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the size of our estates in Cairhien, my Lord,&rdquo;
Arymilla was saying, leaning over Gaebril, as Morgase approached.
None of them more than glanced at her. As if she were a servant
with the wine!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to speak with you concerning the Two Rivers
Gaebril. In private.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been dealt with, my dear,&rdquo; he said idly,
dabbling his fingers in the water. &ldquo;Other matters concern me now. I
thought you were going to read during the heat of the day. You
should return to your room until the evening&rsquo;s coolness, such as it
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My dear. He had called her my dear in front of these
interlopers! As much as she thrilled to hear that on his lips when
they were alone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Elenia was hiding her mouth. &ldquo;I think not,
Lord Gaebril,&rdquo; Morgase said coldly. &ldquo;You will come with me now. And
these others will be out of the Palace before I return, or I will
exile them from Caemlyn completely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly he was on his feet, a big man, towering over
her. She seemed unable to look at anything but his dark eyes; her
skin tingled as if an icy wind were blowing through the courtyard.
&ldquo;You will go and wait for me, Morgase.&rdquo; His voice was a distant
roar filling her ears. &ldquo;I have dealt with all that needs dealing
with. I will come to you this evening. You will go now. You will
go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had one hand lifted to open the door of her
sitting room before she realized where she was. And what had
happened. He had told her to go, and she had gone. Staring at the
door in horror, she could see the smirks on the men&rsquo;s faces, open
laughter on some of the women&rsquo;s. <em>What has happened to me? How
could I become so besotted with any man?</em> She still felt the
urge to enter, and wait for him.</p>

<p>Dazed, she forced herself to turn and walk away. It
was an effort. Inside, she cringed at the idea of Gaebril&rsquo;s
disappointment in her when he did not find her where he expected,
and cringed further at recognizing the fawning thought.</p>

<p>At, first she had no notion of where she was going or
why, only that she would not wait obediently, not for Gaebril, not
for any man or woman in the world. The fountained courtyard kept
repeating in her head, him telling her to go, and those hateful,
amused faces watching. Her mind still seemed fogged. She could not
comprehend how or why she could have let it happen. She had to
think of something that she could understand, something she could
deal with. Jarid Sarand and the others.</p>

<p>When she assumed the throne she had pardoned them for
everything they had done during the Succession, as she had pardoned
everyone who opposed her. It had seemed best to bury all
animosities before they could fester into the sort of plotting and
scheming that infected so many lands. The Game of Houses it was
called&mdash;<em>Daes Dae&rsquo;mar</em>&mdash;or the Great Game, and
it led to endless, tangled feuds between Houses, to the toppling of
rulers; the Game was at the heart of the civil war in Cairhien, and
no doubt had done its part in the turmoil enveloping Arad Doman and
Tarabon. The pardons had had to go to all to stop <em>Daes
Dae&rsquo;mar</em> being born in Andor, but could she have left any
unsigned, they would have been the parchments with those seven&rsquo;s
names.</p>

<p>Gaebril knew that. Publicly she had shown no
disfavor, but in private she had been willing to speak of her
distrust. They had had to pry their jaws open to swear fealty, and
she could hear the lie on their tongues. Any one would leap at a
chance to pull her down, and all seven together&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There was only one conclusion she could reach.
Gaebril must be plotting against her. It could not be to put Elenia
or Naean on the throne. <em>Not when he has me already</em>, she
thought bitterly, <em>behaving like his lapdog</em>. He must mean
to supplant her himself. To become the first king that Andor had
ever had. And she still felt the desire to return to her book and
wait for him. She still ached for his touch.</p>

<p>It was not until she saw the aged faces in the
hallway around her, the creased cheeks and often bent backs, that
she became aware of where she was. The Pensioners&rsquo; Quarters. Some
servants returned to their families when they grew old, but others
had been so long in the Palace that they could think of no other
life. Here they had their own small apartments, their own shaded
garden and a spacious courtyard. Like every queen before her, she
supplemented their pensions by letting them buy food through the
Palace kitchens for less than its cost, and the infirmary treated
their ills. Creaky bows and unsteady curtsies followed her, and
murmurs of &ldquo;The Light shine upon you, my Queen,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Light
bless you, my Queen,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Light protect you, my Queen.&rdquo; She
acknowledged them absently. She knew where she was going now.</p>

<p>Lini&rsquo;s door was like all the others along the
green-tiled corridor, unadorned save for a carving of the rearing
Lion Of Andor. She never thought of knocking before entering; she
was the Queen, and this was her Palace. Her old nurse was not
there, though a teakettle steaming over a small fire in the brick
fireplace said she would not be long.</p>

<p>The two snug rooms were neatly furnished, the bed
made to perfection, the two chairs precisely aligned at the table,
where a blue vase in the exact center held a small fan of greenery.
Lini had always been a great one for neatness. Morgase was willing
to wager that within the wardrobe in the bedchamber every dress was
arranged just so with every other, and the same for pots in the
cupboard beside the fireplace in the other room.</p>

<p>Six painted ivory miniatures in small wooden stands
made a line on the mantelpiece. How Lini could have afforded them
on a nurse&rsquo;s stipend was more than Morgase had ever been able to
imagine; she could not ask such a question, of course. In pairs,
they showed three young women and the same three as babes. Elayne
was there, and herself. Taking down the portrait of herself at
fourteen, a slender filly of a girl, she could not believe that she
had ever looked so innocent. She had worn that ivory silk dress the
day she had gone to the White Tower, never dreaming at the time
that she would be Queen, only harboring the vain hope that she
might become Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>Absentmindedly she thumbed the Great Serpent ring on
her left hand. She had not earned that, precisely; women who could
not channel were not awarded the ring. But short of her sixteenth
nameday she had returned to contest the Rose Crown in the name of
House Trakand, and when she won the throne nearly two years later,
the ring had been presented to her. By tradition, the Daughter-Heir
of Andor always trained in the Tower, and in recognition of Andor&rsquo;s
long support of the Tower was given the ring whether or not she
could channel. She had only been the heir to House Trakand in the
Tower, but they gave it to her anyway once the Rose Crown was on
her head.</p>

<p>Replacing her own portrait, she took down her
mother&rsquo;s, taken at perhaps two years older. Lini had been nurse to
three generations of Trakand women. Maighdin Trakand had been
beautiful. Morgase could remember that smile, when it had become a
mother&rsquo;s loving beam. It was Maighdin who should have had the Lion
Throne. But a fever had carried her away, and a young girl had
found herself High Seat of House Trakand, in the middle of a
struggle for the throne with no more support in the beginning than
her House retainers and the House bard. <em>I won the Lion Throne.
I will not give it up, and I will not see a man take it. For a
thousand years a queen has ruled Andor, and I will not let that end
now!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Meddling in my things again, are you, child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That voice triggered long-forgotten reflexes. Morgase
had the miniature hidden behind her back before she knew it. With a
rueful shake of her head she put the portrait back on its stand. &ldquo;I
am not a girl in the nursery any longer, Lini. You must remember
that, or one day you will say something where I must do something
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My neck is scrawny and old,&rdquo; Lini said, setting a
net bag of carrots and turnips on the table. She looked frail in
her neat gray dress, her white hair drawn back in a bun from a
narrow face with skin like thin parchment, but her back was
straight, her voice clear and steady, and her dark eyes as sharp as
ever. &ldquo;If you want to give it to hangman or headsman, I am almost
done with it anyway. &lsquo;A gnarled old branch dulls the blade that
severs a sapling.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morgase sighed. Lini would never change. She would
not curtsy if the entire court were watching. &ldquo;You do grow tougher
as you grow older. I am not certain a headsman could find an axe
sharp enough for your neck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not been to see me in some time, so I suppose
there&rsquo;s something you need to work out in your mind. When you were
in the nursery&mdash;and later&mdash;you always used to come to
me when you couldn&rsquo;t work matters out. Shall I make a pot of
tea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some time, Lini? I visit you every week, and a
wonder I do, given how you speak to me. I would exile the highest
lady in Andor if she said half what you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lini gave her a level look. &ldquo;You have not darkened my
doorway since the spring. And I talk as I always have; I&rsquo;m too old
to change now. Do you want tea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Morgase put a hand to her head in confusion.
She did visit Lini every week. She could remember&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She could not
remember. Gaebril had filled her hours so completely that sometimes
it was hard to remember anything other than him. &ldquo;No, I do not
want tea. I do not know why I came. You cannot help me with the
problem I have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her old nurse snorted, though somehow she made it a
delicate sound. &ldquo;Your trouble is with Gaebril, isn&rsquo;t it? Only now
you&rsquo;re ashamed to tell me. Girl, I changed you in your cradle,
tended you when you were sick and heaving your stomach up, and told
you what you needed to know about men. You have never been too
shamed to discuss anything with me, and now is no time to
begin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gaebril?&rdquo; Morgase&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;You know? But
how?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, child,&rdquo; Lini said sadly, &ldquo;everyone knows, though
no one&rsquo;s had the courage to tell you. I might have, if you hadn&rsquo;t
stayed away, but it is hardly something I could go running to you
with, now is it? It is the kind of thing a woman won&rsquo;t believe
until she finds out for herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; Morgase demanded. &ldquo;It
was your duty to come to me if you knew, Lini. It was everyone&rsquo;s
duty! Light, I am the last to know, and now it may be too late to
stop it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too late?&rdquo; Lini said incredulously. &ldquo;Why should it
be too late? You bundle Gaebril out of the Palace, out of Andor,
and Alteima and the others with him, and it is done with. Too late,
indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Morgase could not speak. &ldquo;Alteima,&rdquo; she
said finally, &ldquo;and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the others?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lini stared at her, then shook her head in disgust.
&ldquo;I am an old fool; my wits are dry-rooted. Well, you know now.&nbsp;&lsquo;When the honey&rsquo;s out of the comb, there&rsquo;s no putting it back.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
Her voice became gentler and at the same time brisk, the voice she
had used for telling Morgase that her pony had broken a leg and had
to be put down. &ldquo;Gaebril spends most of his nights with you, but
Alteima has nearly as much of his time. He spreads himself thin
with the other six. Five have rooms in the Palace. One, a big-eyed
young thing, he sneaks in and out for some reason all swathed in a
cloak, even in this heat. Perhaps she has a husband. I&rsquo;m sorry,
girl, but truth is truth. &lsquo;Better to face the bear than run from
it.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

<p>Morgase&rsquo;s knees sagged, and if Lini had not hurriedly
pulled a chair from the table to shove under her, she would have
sat down on the floor. Alteima. Him watching the two of them as
they gossiped took on a new image, now. A man fondly watching two
of his pet cats at play. And <em>six</em> others! Rage boiled up in
her, a rage that had been lacking when she only thought he was
after her throne. That she had considered coldly, clearly; as
clearly as she could consider anything recently. That was a danger
that had to be looked at with cold reason. But this! The man had
ensconced his jades in her palace. He had made her just another of
his trulls. She wanted his head. She wanted him flayed alive. The
Light help her, she wanted his touch. <em>I must be going
mad!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be solved along with everything else,&rdquo; she
said coldly. Much depended on who was in Caemlyn, and who on their
country estates. &ldquo;Where is Lord Pelivar? Lord Abelle? Lady
Arathelle?&rdquo; They led strong Houses, and many retainers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exiled,&rdquo; Lini said slowly, giving her an odd look.
&ldquo;You exiled them from the city last spring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morgase stared back. She remembered none of that.
Except that now, dim and distant, she did. &ldquo;Lady Ellorien?&rdquo; she
said slowly. &ldquo;Lady Aemlyn, and Lord Luan?&rdquo; More strong Houses. More
Houses that had been behind her before she gained the throne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exiled,&rdquo; Lini replied just as slowly. &ldquo;You had
Ellorien flogged for demanding to know why.&rdquo; She bent to brush
Morgase&rsquo;s hair back, gnarled fingers lingering on her cheek as they
had when she checked for fever. &ldquo;Are you well, girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morgase nodded dully, but it was because she was
remembering, in a shadowy way. Ellorien, screaming in outrage as
her gown was ripped down the back. House Traemane had been the very
first to throw its support to Trakand, brought by a plumply pretty
woman only a few years older than Morgase. Brought by Ellorien, now
one of her closest friends. At least, she had been. Elayne had been
named after Ellorien&rsquo;s grandmother. Vaguely she could recall others
leaving the city; distancing themselves from her, it seemed obvious
now. And those who remained? Houses too weak to be of any use, or
else sycophants. She seemed to recall signing numerous documents
Gaebril had laid in front of her, creating new titles. Gaebril&rsquo;s
toad-eaters and her enemies; they were all she could count on being
strong in Caemlyn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not care what you say,&rdquo; Lini said firmly. &ldquo;You
have no fever, but there&rsquo;s something wrong. You need an Aes Sedai
Healer is what you need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No Aes Sedai.&rdquo; Morgase&rsquo;s voice was even harder. She
fingered her ring again, briefly. She knew that her animosity
toward the Tower had grown recently beyond what some might say was
reasonable, yet she could no longer make herself trust a White
Tower that seemed to be trying to hide her daughter from her. Her
letter to the new Amyrlin demanding Elayne&rsquo;s return&mdash;no one
<em>demanded</em> anything of an Amyrlin Seat, but she had&mdash;that letter was yet unanswered. It had barely had time to reach Tar
Valon. In any case, she knew for cold fact that she would not have
an Aes Sedai near her. And yet, right alongside that, she could not
think of Elayne without a swell of pride. Raised Accepted after so
short a time. Elayne might well be the first woman to sit on the
throne of Andor as full Aes Sedai, not just Tower trained. It made
no sense that she could feel both things at once, but very little
made any sense just now. And her daughter would never have the Lion
Throne if Morgase did not secure it for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said no Aes Sedai, Lini, so you might as well stop
looking at me like that. This is one time you will not make me
take bad-tasting medicine. Besides which, I doubt there is an Aes
Sedai of any stripe to be found in Caemlyn.&rdquo; Her old supporters
gone, exiled by her own signature, and maybe her enemies for good
over what she had done to Ellorien. New lords and ladies in their
places in the Palace. New faces in the Guards. What loyalty
remained there? &ldquo;Would you recognize a Guardsman Lieutenant named
Tallanvor, Lini?&rdquo; At the other woman&rsquo;s quick nod, she went on.
&ldquo;Find him for me, and bring him here. But do not let him know you
are bringing him to me. In fact, tell everyone in the Pensioners&rsquo;
Quarters that, should anyone ask, I am not here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is more to this than Gaebril and his women,
isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just go, Lini. And hurry. There is not much time.&rdquo;
By the shadows she could see in the tree-filled garden through the
window, the sun had passed its height. Evening would be there all
too soon. Evening, when Gaebril would be looking for her.</p>

<p>When Lini left, Morgase remained in the chair,
sitting rigidly. She dared not stand; her knees were stronger now,
but she feared that if she began moving she would not stop until
she was back in her sitting room, waiting for Gaebril. The urge was
that strong, especially now that she was alone. And once he looked
at her<em>,</em> once he touched her, she had no doubt that she
would forgive him everything. Forget everything, maybe, based on
how fuzzy and incomplete her memories were. Had she not known
better, she could have thought that he had used the One Power on
her in some way, but no man who could channel survived to his
age.</p>

<p>Lini had often told her that there was always one man
in the world for whom a woman would find herself behaving a
brainless fool, but she had never believed that she could succumb.
Still, her choices in men had never been good, however right they
seemed at the time.</p>

<p>Taringail Damodred she had wed for political reasons.
He had been married to Tigraine, the Daughter-Heir whose
disappearance had set off the Succession when Mordrellein died.
Marrying him had made a link with the old queen, smoothing the
doubts of most of her opponents, and more importantly, had
maintained the alliance that had ended the ceaseless wars with
Cairhien. In such ways did queens choose their husbands. Taringail
had been a cold, distant man, and there was never love, despite two
wonderful children; it had been almost a relief when he died in a
hunting accident.</p>

<p>Thomdril Merrilin, House bard and then Court-bard,
had been a joy at first, intelligent and witty, a laughing man who
used the tricks of the Game of Houses to aid her to the throne and
help strengthen Andor once she had it. He had been twice her age
then, yet she might have married him&mdash;marriages with
commoners were not unheard of in Andor&mdash;but he vanished
without a word, and her temper got the better of her. She never had
learned why he had gone, but it did not matter. When he finally
returned she would surely have rescinded the arrest order, but for
once instead of softly turning her anger aside he had met her harsh
word for harsh word, saying things she could never forgive. Her
ears still burned to remember being called a spoiled child and a
puppet of Tar Valon. He had actually shaken her, his queen!</p>

<p>Then there had been Gareth Bryne, strong and capable,
as bluff as his face and as stubborn as she; he had turned out to
be a treasonous fool. He was well out of her life. It seemed years
since she had seen him instead of little more than half of one.</p>

<p>And finally Gaebril. The crown to her list of bad
choices. At least the others had not tried to supplant her.</p>

<p>Not so many men for one woman&rsquo;s life, but in another
way, too many. Another thing that Lini sometimes said was that men
were only good for three things, though very good for those. She
had been on the throne before Lini had thought her old enough to
tell what the three things were. <em>Perhaps if I&rsquo;d kept just to
the dancing</em>, she thought wryly, <em>I&rsquo;d not have so much
trouble with them</em>.</p>

<p>The shadows in the garden beyond the window had
shifted an hour&rsquo;s worth before Lini returned with young Tallanvor,
who went to one knee while she was still shutting the door. &ldquo;He
didn&rsquo;t want to come with me at first,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Fifty years ago I
suppose I could have shown what you are displaying to the world,
and he&rsquo;d have followed quick enough, but now I must needs use sweet
reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tallanvor turned his head to look up at her sourly.
&ldquo;You threatened to harry me here with a stick if I did not come.
You are lucky I wondered what was so important to you, instead of
having somebody drag you to the infirmary.&rdquo; Her stern sniff did not
faze him. His acrid gaze turned angry as it shifted to Morgase. &ldquo;I
see your meeting with Gaebril did not go well, my Queen. I had
hoped for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was looking straight at her eyes, but Lini&rsquo;s
comment had made her aware of her dress again. She felt as though
glowing arrows were pointing to her exposed bosom. It was an effort
to keep her hands calmly in her lap. &ldquo;You are a sharp lad,
Tallanvor. And loyal, I believe, else you would not have come to me
with the news of the Two Rivers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a boy,&rdquo; he snapped, jerking upright where
he knelt. &ldquo;I am a man who has sworn his life in service to his
queen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She let her temper flare right back at him. &ldquo;If you
are a man, behave as one. Stand, and answer your queen&rsquo;s questions
truthfully. And remember that I <em>am</em> your queen, <em>
young</em> Tallanvor. Whatever you think may have happened, I am
Queen of Andor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, my Queen. I hear and obey.&rdquo; The words
were properly said, if not exactly contrite, but he stood, head
high, staring at her as defiantly as ever. Light, the man was as
stubborn as Gareth Bryne had ever been.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many loyal men are there among the Guards in the
Palace? How many will obey their oaths and follow me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he said quietly, and suddenly all of his
anger was gone, though he still stared intently at her face. &ldquo;For
the rest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;If you wish to find loyal men, you must look to the
outlying garrisons, perhaps as far as Whitebridge. Some who were in
Caemlyn were sent to Cairhien with the levies, but the rest in the
city are Gaebril&rsquo;s to a man. Their new&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Their new oath is to
throne and law, not the Queen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was worse than she had hoped for, but no more than
she had expected, really. Whatever he was, Gaebril was no fool.
&ldquo;Then I must go elsewhere to begin reestablishing my rule.&rdquo; The
Houses would be difficult to rally after the exiles, after
Ellorien, but it had to be done. &ldquo;Gaebril may try to stop me
leaving the Palace&rdquo;&mdash;she found a faint memory of trying to
leave, twice, and being halted by Gaebril&mdash;&ldquo;so you will
procure two horses and wait in the street behind the south stables.
I will meet you there, dressed for riding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too public,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And too close. Gaebril&rsquo;s men
might recognize you, however you disguised yourself. I know a man&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Could you find an inn called The Queen&rsquo;s Blessing, in the
western part of the New City?&rdquo; The New City was new only in
comparison with the Inner City it surrounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can.&rdquo; She did not like being opposed, even when it
made sense. Bryne had done that, too. It would be a pleasure to
show this young man just how well she could disguise herself. It
was her habit once a year, though she realized that she had not
done it so far this year, to dress as a commoner and walk the
streets to feel the pulse of the people. No one had ever recognized
her. &ldquo;But can this man be trusted, young Tallanvor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Basel Gill is as loyal to you as I am myself.&rdquo; He
hesitated, anguish crossing his face then being replaced by anger
once more. &ldquo;Why have you waited so long? You must have known, you
must have seen, yet you have waited while Gaebril tightened his
hands around Andor&rsquo;s neck. Why have you waited?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So. His anger was honestly come by, and it deserved
an honest answer. Only she had no answer, certainly not one she
could tell him. &ldquo;It is not your place to question your Queen, young
man,&rdquo; she said with a gentle firmness. &ldquo;A loyal man, as I know that
you are loyal, serves without question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He let out a long breath. &ldquo;I will await you in the
stable of The Queen&rsquo;s Blessing, my Queen.&rdquo; And with a bow suitable
for a state audience, he was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you keep calling him young?&rdquo; Lini demanded
once the door closed. &ldquo;It puts his back up. &lsquo;A fool puts a burr
under the saddle before she rides.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He <em>is</em> young, Lini. Young enough to be my
son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lini snorted, and this time there was nothing
delicate about it. &ldquo;He has a few years on Galad, and Galad is too
old to be yours. You were playing with dolls when Tallanvor was
born, and thinking babes came the same way as dolls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sighing, Morgase wondered if the woman had treated
her mother like this. Probably. And if Lini lived long enough to
see Elayne on the throne&mdash;which somehow she did not doubt,
Lini would last forever&mdash;she would probably treat Elayne no
differently. That was assuming that a throne remained for Elayne to
inherit. &ldquo;The question is, is he as loyal as he seems, Lini? One
faithful Guardsman, when every other loyal man in the Palace has
been sent away. Suddenly it seems too good to be true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He swore the new oath.&rdquo; Morgase opened her mouth,
but Lini forestalled her. &ldquo;I saw him afterwards, alone behind the
stables. That&rsquo;s how I knew who you meant; I found out his name. He
did not see me. He was on his knees, tears streaming down his face.
He alternated apologizing to you and repeating the old oath. Not
just to &lsquo;the Queen of Andor,&rsquo; but to &lsquo;Queen Morgase of Andor.&rsquo; He
swore in the old way, on his sword, slicing his arm to show he
would shed his last drop before breaking it. I know a thing or two
of men, girl. That one will follow you against an army with nothing
but his bare hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was good to know. If she could not trust him,
she would have to doubt Lini next. No, never Lini. He had sworn in
the old way? That was something for stories, now. And she was
letting her thoughts drift again. Surely Gaebril&rsquo;s clouding of her
mind was finished now, with all she knew. Then why did a part of
her still want to go back to her sitting room and wait? She had to
concentrate. &ldquo;I will need a simple dress, Lini. One that does not
fit too well. A little soot from the fireplace, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lini insisted on coming, too. Morgase would have had
to tie her to a chair to leave her behind, and she was not certain
that the old woman would have let herself be tied; she had always
seemed frail, and had always been far stronger than she seemed.</p>

<p>When they slipped out through a small side gate,
Morgase did not look very much like herself. A bit of soot had
darkened her red-gold hair, taken its sheen away and made it lank.
Sweat rolling down her face helped, as well. No one believed that
queens sweated. A shapeless dress of rough&mdash;very rough&mdash;gray wool, with divided skirts, completed her disguise. Even her
shift and stockings were coarse wool. She looked a farm woman who
had ridden the cart horse to market and now wanted to see a little
of the city. Lini looked herself, straight-backed and no-nonsense,
in a green woolen riding dress, well cut but ten years out of
fashion.</p>

<p>Wishing she could scratch, Morgase also wished that
the other woman had not taken her so to heart about the dress not
fitting very well. Stuffing the low-necked gown away under the bed,
her old nurse had muttered some saying about displaying wares you
did not mean to sell, and when Morgase claimed she had just made it
up, her reply was <em>At my age, if I make it up, it&rsquo;s still an old
saying</em>. Morgase more than half-suspected that her itchy,
ill-draped dress was punishment for that gown.</p>

<p>The Inner City was built on hills, streets following
the natural curve of the land and planned to give sudden views of
parks full of trees and monuments, or tile-covered towers
glittering a hundred colors in the sun. Sudden rises hurled the eye
across Caemlyn entire, to the rolling plains and forests beyond.
Morgase saw none of it as she hurried through the crowds thronging
the streets. Usually she would have tried to listen to the people,
to gauge their mood. This time she heard only the hum and babble of
a great city. She had no thought of trying to rouse them. Thousands
of men armed mainly with stones and rage could overwhelm the Guards
in the Royal Palace, but if she had not known it before, the riots
in the spring that had brought Gaebril to her attention, and the
near riots the year before, had shown what mobs could do. She meant
to rule again in Caemlyn, not see it burned.</p>

<p>Beyond the white walls of the Inner City, the New
City had its own beauties. Tall slender towers, and domes gleaming
white and gold, huge expanses of red-tiled roofs, and the great,
towered outer walls, pale gray streaked with silver and white.
Broad boulevards, split down the middle by wide expanses of trees
and grass, were jammed with people and carriages and wagons. Except
to notice in passing that the grass was dying for lack of rain,
Morgase kept her mind on what she was hunting.</p>

<p>From the experience of her annual forays, she chose
the people she questioned carefully. Men, mostly. She knew how she
looked, even with soot in her hair, and some women would give wrong
directions from jealousy. Men, on the other hand, racked their
brains to be right, to impress her. None with too smug a face, or
too rough. The first were often offended at being approached, as
though they were not afoot themselves, and the others were likely
to think a woman asking directions had something else on her
mind.</p>

<p>One fellow with a chin too big for his face, hawking
a tray of pins and needles, grinned at her and said, &ldquo;Did anyone
ever tell you you look a mite like the Queen? Whatever mess she&rsquo;s
made of us, she&rsquo;s a pretty one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave him a raucous laugh that earned a stern look
from Lini. &ldquo;You save your flattery for your wife. The second turn
to the left, you say? I thank you. And for the compliment,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she pushed on through the crowd, a frown settled
on her face. She had heard too much of that. Not that she looked
like the Queen, but that Morgase had made a mess of things. Gaebril
had raised taxes heavily to pay for his levies, it seemed, but she
took the blame, and rightly so. The responsibility was the Queen&rsquo;s.
Other laws had come out of the Palace, as well, laws that made
little sense, but did make people&rsquo;s lives more difficult. She heard
whispers about herself, that maybe Andor had had queens long
enough. Only murmurs, but what one man dared speak in a low voice,
ten thought. Perhaps it would not have been as easy as she had
thought to rouse mobs against Gaebril.</p>

<p>Eventually she found her goal, a broad stone inn, the
sign over the door bearing a man kneeling before a golden-haired
woman in the Rose Crown, one of her hands on his head. The Queen&rsquo;s
Blessing. If it was meant to be her, it was not a good likeness.
The cheeks were too fat.</p>

<p>Not until she stopped in front of the inn did she
realize that Lini was puffing. She had set a quick pace, and the
woman was far from young. &ldquo;Lini, I am sorry. I should not have
walked so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t keep up with you, girl, how will I be
able to tend Elayne&rsquo;s babes? Do you mean to stand there? &lsquo;Dragging
feet never finish a journey.&rsquo; He said he would be in the
stable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The white-haired woman stalked off, muttering to
herself, and Morgase followed her around the inn. Before stepping
into the stone stable, she shaded her eyes to look at the sun. No
more than two hours until dusk; Gaebril would be looking by then,
if he was not already.</p>

<p>Tallanvor was not alone in the stall-lined stable.
When he went to one knee on the straw-covered floor, in a green
wool coat with his sword belted over it, two men and a woman knelt
with him, if a bit hesitantly, unsure of her as she was. The stout
man, pink-faced and balding, must be Basel Gill, the innkeeper. An
old leather jerkin, studded with steel discs, strained around his
girth, and he wore a sword at his hip, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Queen,&rdquo; Gill said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not carried a sword in
years&mdash;not since the Aiel War&mdash;but I&rsquo;d count it an
honor if you allowed me to follow you.&rdquo; He should have looked
ridiculous, but he did not.</p>

<p>Morgase studied the other two, a hulking fellow in a
rough gray coat, with heavy-lidded eyes, an oft-broken nose, and
scars on his face, and a short, pretty woman approaching her middle
years. She seemed to be with the street tough, but her high-necked
blue wool dress appeared too finely woven for one like him to have
bought.</p>

<p>The fellow sensed her doubts, for all his lazy-eyed
appearance. &ldquo;I am Lamgwin, my Queen, and a good Queen&rsquo;s man.
&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t right, what&rsquo;s been done, and it has to be put straight. I
want to follow you, too. Me and Breane, both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rise,&rdquo; she told them. &ldquo;It may be some days yet
before it is safe for you to acknowledge me as your queen. I will
be glad of your company, Master Gill. And yours, Master Lamgwin,
but it will be safer for your woman if she remains in Caemlyn.
There are hard days ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brushing straw from her skirts, Breane gave her a
sharp look, and Lini a sharper. &ldquo;I have known hard days,&rdquo; she said
in a Cairhienin accent. Nobly born, unless Morgase missed her
guess; one of the refugees. &ldquo;And I never knew a good man until I
found Lamgwin. Or until he found me. The loyalty and love he bears
for you, I bear for him tenfold. He follows you, but I follow him.
I will not stay behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morgase drew breath, then nodded her acceptance. The
woman seemed to take it for granted in any case. A fine seed for
the army to retake her throne: One young soldier who scowled at her
as often as not, a balding innkeeper who looked as if he had not
been on a horse in twenty years, a street tough who appeared more
than half-asleep, and a refugee Cairhienin noblewoman who had made
it clear that her loyalties went only as far as the tough. And
Lini, of course. Lini, who treated her as though she were still in
the nursery. Oh, yes, a very fine seed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do we go, my Queen?&rdquo; Gill asked as he began
leading already saddled horses out of their stalls. Lamgwin moved
with surprising speed to throw another high-cantled saddle on a
horse for Lini.</p>

<p>Morgase realized that she had not considered that.
<em>Light, Gaebril can&rsquo;t still be fogging my mind</em>. She still
felt that urge to return to her sitting room, though. It was not
he. She had had to concentrate on getting out of the Palace and
reaching here. Once she would have gone to Ellorien first, but
Pelivar or Arathelle would do. Once she had reasoned out how to
explain away their exiles.</p>

<p>Before she could open her mouth, Tallanvor said, &ldquo;It
must be to Gareth Bryne. There is hard feeling against you among
the great Houses, my Queen, but with Bryne following you, they will
re-swear allegiance, if only because they know he will win every
battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She clamped her teeth shut to hold back instant
refusal. Bryne was a traitor. But he was also one of the finest
generals alive. His presence would be a convincing argument when
she had to make Pelivar and the rest forget that she had exiled
them. Very well. No doubt he would leap at the chance to be
Captain-General of the Queen&rsquo;s Guards once more. And if not, she
would manage well enough without him.</p>

<p>When the sun touched the horizon, they were five
miles out of Caemlyn and riding hard for Kore Springs.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Night was when Padan Fain felt most comfortable. As
he padded through the tapestry-bedecked corridors of the White
Tower, it seemed as though the darkness outside made a cloak to
hide him from his enemies, despite the stand-lamps, gilded and
mirrored, burning along his way. A false feeling, he knew; his
enemies were many and everywhere. Right that moment, as in every
waking hour, he could feel Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Not where he was, but that
he was still alive, somewhere. Still alive. It was a gift received
at Shayol Ghul, in the Pit of Doom, that awareness of al&rsquo;Thor.</p>

<p>His mind skittered away from memories of what had
been done to him in the Pit. He had been distilled there, remade.
But later, in Aridhol, he had been reborn. Reborn to smite old
enemies and new.</p>

<p>He could feel something else as he stalked the empty
night hallways of the Tower, a thing that was his, stolen from him.
A sharper desire drew him at this moment than his longing for
al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s death, or the Tower&rsquo;s destruction, or even revenge
against his ancient foe. A hunger to be whole.</p>

<p>The heavy paneled door had thick hinges and iron
straps, and a black iron lock set in it as big as his head. Few
doors in the Tower were ever locked&mdash;who would dare steal in
the midst of Aes Sedai?&mdash;yet some things the Tower accounted
too dangerous to be easily accessible. The most dangerous of all
they kept behind this door, guarded by a stout lock.</p>

<p>Giggling softly, he took two thin, curved metal rods
from his coat pocket, inserted them into the keyhole, probing and
pressing, twisting. With a slow snap, the bolt came back. For a
moment he sagged against the door, laughing hoarsely. Guarded by a
stout lock. Surrounded by Aes Sedai power, and guarded by simple
metal. Even the servants and novices should be done with their
chores at this hour, but someone still might be awake, might just
wander by. Occasional ripples of mirth still shook him as he
replaced the lock-picks in his pocket and took out a fat beeswax
candle, lighting the wick at a nearby stand-lamp.</p>

<p>He held the candle high as he closed the door behind
him, peering around. Shelves lined the walls, holding plain boxes
and inlaid chests of various sizes and shapes, small figures in
bone or ivory or darker material, things of metal and glass and
crystal that sparkled in the candlelight. Nothing that appeared
dangerous. Dust covered everything; even the Aes Sedai came here
seldom, and they allowed no one else in. What he was seeking pulled
him to it.</p>

<p>On a waist-high shelf stood a dark metal box. He
opened it, revealing lead walls two inches thick, with just enough
space inside for a curved dagger in a golden sheath, a large ruby
set in its hilt. Neither the gold nor the ruby, glittering dark as
blood, interested him. Hastily he spilled a little wax to hold the
candle beside the box and snatched up the dagger.</p>

<p>He sighed as soon as he touched it, stretched
languorously. He was whole again, one with what had bound him so
long ago, one with what in a very real way had given him life.</p>

<p>Iron hinges creaked faintly, and he darted for the
door, baring the curved blade. The pale young woman opening the
door had only time to gape, to try to leap back, before he slashed
her cheek; in the same motion he dropped the sheath and seized her
arm, jerked her past him into the storeroom. Putting his head out,
he peered up and down the hallway. Still empty.</p>

<p>He took his time about pulling his head back and
shutting the door again. He knew what he would find.</p>

<p>The young woman lay thrashing on the stone floor,
trying and failing to scream. Her hands clawed at a face already
black and bloated beyond recognition, the dark swelling oozing down
onto her shoulders like thick oil. Her snowy skirts, banded in
colors at the hem, flailed as her feet scrabbled uselessly. He
licked at a splash of blood on his hand and giggled as he picked up
the sheath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spun, dagger reaching, but the air around him
seemed to turn solid, encasing him from his neck to the sole of his
boots. He hung there, on the balls of his feet, dagger extended to
stab, staring at Alviarin as she shut the door behind her and
leaned against it to study him. There had been no creak this time.
The soft scraping of the dying girl&rsquo;s slippers on the floorstones
could never have masked it. He blinked away sweat that was suddenly
stinging his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you really think,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai went on, &ldquo;that
there would be no guard on this room, no watch kept? A ward was set
on that lock. That young fool&rsquo;s task tonight was to monitor it. Had
she done as she was supposed to, you would find a dozen Warders and
as many Aes Sedai outside this door now. She is paying the price of
her stupidity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The thrashing behind him stilled, and his eyes
narrowed. Alviarin was not Yellow Ajah, but even so she could have
made an attempt to Heal the young woman. And she had not raised the
alarm the Accepted should have, either, or she would not now be
here alone. &ldquo;You are Black Ajah,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dangerous accusation,&rdquo; she said calmly. It was not
clear to which of them it was dangerous. &ldquo;Siuan Sanche tried to
claim the Black Ajah was real when she was under the question. She
begged to tell us of them. Elaida would not hear it, and will not.
Tales of the Black Ajah are a vile slander against the Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are Black Ajah,&rdquo; he said in a louder voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to steal that?&rdquo; She sounded as though he
had not spoken. &ldquo;The ruby is not worth it, Fain. Or whatever your
name is. That blade is tainted so none but a fool would touch it
except with tongs, or be near it for a moment longer than
necessary. You can see what it did to Verine. So why did you come
here and go straight to what you should not have known was here?
You cannot have had time for any search.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could dispose of Elaida for you. One touch of
this, and even Healing will not save her.&rdquo; He tried to gesture with
the dagger, but could not budge it a hair, if he could have moved
it, Alviarin would be dead by now. &ldquo;You could be first in the
Tower, not second.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed at him, cool contemptuous chimes. &ldquo;Do you
think I would not be first if I had wished it? Second suits me. Let
Elaida claim credit for what she calls successes, and sweat for her
failures, too. I know where the power lies. Now, answer my
questions, or two corpses will be found here in the morning instead
of one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There would be two in any case, whether he answered
her with suitable lies or not; she did not mean to let him live. &ldquo;I
have seen Thakan&rsquo;dar.&rdquo; Saying that hurt; the memories it brought
were agony. He refused to whimper, forced the words out. &ldquo;The great
sea of fog, rolling and crashing in silence against the black
cliffs, the fires of the forges glowing red beneath, and lightning
stabbing up into a sky fit to drive men mad.&rdquo; He did not want to go
on, but he made himself. &ldquo;I have taken the path down to the belly
of Shayol Ghul, down the long way with stones like fangs brushing
my head, to the shore of a lake of fire and molten rock&mdash;&rdquo; <em>No, not again!</em> &ldquo;&mdash;that holds the Great Lord of the
Dark in its endless depths. The heavens above Shayol Ghul are
black at noon with his breath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alviarin was standing upright now, eyes wide. Not
fearful, but impressed. &ldquo;I have heard of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; she began softly,
then shook herself and stared at him piercingly. &ldquo;Who are you? Why
are you here? Did one of the For&mdash;the Chosen send you? Why was
I not informed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He threw back his head and laughed. &ldquo;Are the tasks
given to the likes of me for the likes of you to be knowing?&rdquo; The
accents of his native Lugard were strong again; in a way it was his
native city. &ldquo;Do the Chosen confide everything in you, then?&rdquo;
Something inside seemed to shout that this was not the way, but he
hated Aes Sedai, and that something inside him did, too. &ldquo;Be
careful, pretty little Aes Sedai, or they&rsquo;ll be giving you to a
Myrddraal for its sport.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her glare was icicles stabbing his eyes. &ldquo;We shall
see, Master Fain. I will clear away this mess you have made, and
then we shall see which of us stands higher with the Chosen.&rdquo;
Eyeing the dagger, she backed from the room. The air around him did
not soften until she had been gone a full minute.</p>

<p>Silently he snarled at himself. Fool. Playing the Aes
Sedai&rsquo;s game, groveling for them; then one moment of anger to ruin
all. Sheathing the dagger, he nicked himself, and licked the wound
before sticking the weapon under his coat. He was not at all what
she thought. He had been a Darkfriend once, but he was beyond that,
now. Beyond it, above it. Something different. Something more. If
she managed to communicate with one of the Forsaken before he could
dispose of her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Better not to try. No time to find the Horn of
Valere now. There were followers awaiting him outside the city.
They should still be waiting. He had put fear into them. He hoped
some of the humans were still alive.</p>

<p>Before the sun rose he was out of the Tower, off the
island of Tar Valon. al&rsquo;Thor was out there, somewhere. And he was
whole again.</p>
