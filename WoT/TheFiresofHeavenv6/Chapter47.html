<h4><em>The Price of a Ship</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">F</span>inishing
her morning wash, Nynaeve toweled herself
dry and pulled on a fresh silk shift reluctantly. Silk was not as
cool as linen, and even with the sun only just up, the heat in the
wagon foretold another scorching day. Besides which, the thing was
cut so she was half afraid it would fall in a puddle around her
ankles if she breathed wrong. At least it was not damp with
nightsweat, as her discarded one was.</p>

<p>Disturbing dreams had racked her sleep, dreams of
Moghedien that woke her bolt upright&mdash;and those better than
the ones she did not wake out of&mdash;dreams of Birgitte shooting
arrows at her and <em>not</em> missing, dreams of the Prophet&rsquo;s
followers rioting through the menagerie, of being stranded forever
in Samara because no vessel ever came, of reaching Salidar and
finding Elaida in charge. Or Moghedien again, there too. She had
wakened weeping from that one.</p>

<p>All just worry, of course, and natural enough. Three
nights camped here without a ship appearing, three sweltering days
of standing blindfolded against that cursed piece of wall. That was
enough to put anyone on edge, even without worrying whether
Moghedien was closing in. But then, just because the woman knew
they were with a menagerie did not mean she had to find them in
Samara. There were other traveling menageries in the world besides
those gathered here. Thinking up reasons not to worry was easier
than not worrying, though.</p>

<p><em>But why should I be anxious about Egwene?</em>
Dipping a split twig into a small dish of salt-and-soda on the
washstand, she began scrubbing her teeth vigorously. Egwene had
popped up in nearly every dream, yammering at her, but she could
not see how Egwene came into them.</p>

<p>In truth, anxiety and lack of sleep were only part of
what made her mood vile this morning. The others were such minor
things, but they were realities. A pebble in your shoe was small
compared to having your head cut off, but if the pebble was there
and the chopping block might never be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was not possible to avoid her own reflection, and
her hair hanging loose about her shoulders instead of decently
braided. Brush it how she would, the brassy red color never became
less loathsome. And she knew all too well that a blue dress was
laid out on the bed behind her. A blue to make even a Tinker woman
blink, and cut as low as the original red gown hanging on a peg.
That was why she had on this precariously clinging shift. One dress
like that was not enough, not according to Valan Luca. Clarine was
at work on another pair in a virulent yellow, and there was talk of
stripes. Nynaeve did not want to know about stripes.</p>

<p><em>At least the man could let me choose the
colors</em>, she thought, working the split twig furiously. Or
Clarine. But no, he had his own ideas, and he never asked. Not
Valan Luca. His color choices sometimes made her forget the
necklines. <em>I ought to throw it in his face!</em> Yet she knew
she would not. Birgitte flaunted herself in those dresses without
the hint of a blush. The woman was certainly <em>nothing</em> like
any of the stories about her! Not that she was going to wear the
fool dress without protest because Birgitte did. She was not
competing with the woman in any way. It was just that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;If you
have to do a thing,&rdquo; she growled around the twig, &ldquo;best you get
used it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; Elayne asked. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to
talk, please take that out of your mouth. The noise is disgusting
otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wiping her chin, Nynaeve glared over her shoulder.
Elayne was seated on her own narrow bed with her legs drawn up
beside her, braiding her black-dyed hair. She already had on her
white breeches, all sewn with spangles, and a snowy silk blouse
with ruffles at the neck that was much too sheer. Her
sequin-splattered white coat lay beside her. White. She also had
two suits of clothes for performing, with a third in the making,
all in white, if not exactly plain. &ldquo;If you are going to dress in
that fashion, Elayne, you should not sit so. It&rsquo;s indecent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other woman glowered sullenly, but she did put
her slippered feet on the floor. And raised her chin in that
haughty way she had. &ldquo;I think I may take a walk into the town this
morning,&rdquo; she said coolly, still working at the braid. &ldquo;This wagon
is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;confining.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rinsing her mouth, Nynaeve spat into the washbowl.
Loudly. The wagon certainly did seem smaller by the day. Maybe they
did need to keep out of sight as much as possible&mdash;it had
been her idea, one she was coming to regret&mdash;but this was
becoming ridiculous. Three days shut up with Elayne except when
they went to perform was beginning to feel like three weeks. Or
three months. She had never before realized what an acid tongue
Elayne had. A ship had to come. Any kind of ship. She would give
every last coin hidden in the brick stove, every last jewel,
anything, for a ship today. &ldquo;Well, that wouldn&rsquo;t attract any
attention, would it? But perhaps you could use the exercise. Or
maybe it&rsquo;s just the way those breeches fit your hips.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blue eyes flared, but Elayne&rsquo;s chin remained high and
her tone cold. &ldquo;I dreamed about Egwene last night, and between
going on about Rand and Cairhien&mdash;I worry about what is
happening there, even if you do not&mdash;in between, she said you
were turning into a screaming harridan. Not that I think so,
necessarily. I would have said a fishmonger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you listen to me, you ill-tempered little chit!
If you don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still glaring, Nynaeve snapped her mouth shut, then
drew breath slowly. With an effort she forced her voice to be
level. &ldquo;You dreamed about Egwene?&rdquo; Elayne nodded curtly. &ldquo;And she
talked of Rand and Cairhien?&rdquo; The younger woman rolled her eyes in
exaggerated exasperation and went on with her braid. Nynaeve made
her hand loose its fistful of brassy red hair, made herself stop
thinking of teaching the Daughter-Heir of bloody Andor some simple
common courtesy. If they did not find a ship soon&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;If you can
think of anything except how to show more of your legs than you
already are, it might interest you to know that she was in my
dreams, too. She said Rand won a great victory at Cairhien
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may be exposing my legs,&rdquo; Elayne barked, spots of
color rising in her cheeks, &ldquo;but at least I am not flashing my&mdash;You dreamed of her, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It did not take long to compare notes, though Elayne
continued to show a viperish tongue; Nynaeve had had a perfectly
good reason for screaming at Egwene, and Elayne probably <em>
had</em> been dreaming of parading in front of Rand in her sequined
costume, if not less. Saying so was simple honesty. Even so, it
quickly became clear that Egwene had said the same things in both
their dreams, and that left little room for doubt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She kept saying she was really there,&rdquo; Nynaeve
muttered, &ldquo;but I thought it was just part of the dream.&rdquo; Egwene had
told them often enough that it was possible, talking to someone in
her dreams, but she had never said that she could. &ldquo;Why should I
have believed? I mean, she said she&rsquo;d finally recognized some spear
he&rsquo;s taken to carrying as Seanchan work. That&rsquo;s preposterous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Elayne arched one eyebrow in an
irritating manner. &ldquo;Just as preposterous as finding Cerandin and
her <em>s&rsquo;redit</em>. There must be other Seanchan refugees,
Nynaeve, and spears are likely the <em>least</em> of what they left
behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why could the woman not say anything without a barb?
&ldquo;I notice how well <em>you</em> believed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne threw the finished braid over her shoulder,
then tossed her head again, superciliously, for good measure. &ldquo;I do
hope Rand is all right.&rdquo; Nynaeve sniffed; Egwene had said he would
need days of rest before he was on his feet again but he <em>
had</em> been Healed. The other woman continued, &ldquo;No one has ever
taught him he mustn&rsquo;t overextend himself. Doesn&rsquo;t he know the Power
can kill him if he draws too much, or weaves when tired? That much
is the same for him as for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she meant to change the subject, did she? &ldquo;Perhaps
he doesn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Nynaeve told her sweetly, &ldquo;since there isn&rsquo;t a
White Tower for men.&rdquo; That made her think of something else. &ldquo;Do
you think it really was Sammael?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caught with a retort on the tip of her tongue, Elayne
glowered at her sideways, then heaved a peevish sigh. &ldquo;It hardly
matters to us, does it? What we should be thinking about is using
the ring again. For more than meeting Egwene. There is so much to
learn. The more I do learn, the more I know how much I don&rsquo;t know
yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Nynaeve did not really expect the other woman
to take out the ring <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> then and there, but she
took a reflexive step toward the brick stove. &ldquo;No more trips to
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, for either of us, except to meet her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne went right on without appearing to notice.
Nynaeve could have been talking to herself. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as though we
need to channel. We won&rsquo;t give ourselves away that way.&rdquo; She did
not look at Nynaeve, but there was a hint of bite in her voice. She
maintained that they could use the Power, if they were careful. For
all Nynaeve knew, Elayne did just that behind her back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager
if one of us visited the Heart of the Stone tonight, Egwene would
be there. Think, if <em>we</em> could talk to <em>her</em> in her
dreams, we&rsquo;d not need to worry about encountering Moghedien in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think it&rsquo;s easy to learn, then?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked
dryly. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s so, why hasn&rsquo;t she taught us already? Why hasn&rsquo;t
she done it before this?&rdquo; Her heart was not in it, though. She was
the one worried about Moghedien. Elayne knew the woman was
dangerous, but it was like knowing a viper was dangerous; Elayne
knew, but Nynaeve had been bitten. And being able to communicate
without entering the World of Dreams would be valuable quite aside
from avoiding Moghedien.</p>

<p>In any case, Elayne still was paying no attention to
her. &ldquo;I wonder why she was so insistent we not tell anyone. That
makes no sense.&rdquo; For a moment she worried her underlip with her
teeth. &ldquo;There is another reason to talk to her as soon as we can.
It didn&rsquo;t mean anything to me then, but the last time she spoke to
me, she vanished in midsentence. What I remember now is that before
she did, she suddenly looked surprised, and frightened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve took a deep breath and pressed both hands
hard against her stomach in a vain effort to quiet sudden flutters.
She managed to keep her voice flat, though. &ldquo;Moghedien?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light, you do have cheerful thoughts! No. If
Moghedien could come into our dreams, I think we would know it by
now.&rdquo; Elayne gave a small shiver; she did have some idea of how
dangerous Moghedien was. &ldquo;Anyway, it wasn&rsquo;t that sort of look. She
was frightened, but not enough for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then maybe she isn&rsquo;t in any danger. Maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
Forcing her hands to her sides, Nynaeve compressed her lips
angrily. Only, she was not certain who she was angry with.</p>

<p>Putting the ring away, out of sight, except for
meetings with Egwene, had been a good idea. It had. Any venture
into the World of Dreams could have found Moghedien, and keeping
clear of her was better than a good idea. She already knew she was
overmatched. That thought rankled, worse every time she had it, but
it was the simple truth.</p>

<p>Yet now there was the chance that Egwene needed help.
A small chance. Just because she was properly wary of Moghedien did
not mean she was underrating the possibility. And it might be that
Rand had one of the Forsaken after him in the same personal way
that Moghedien was after her and Elayne. What Egwene reported, both
of Cairhien and of the mountains, smacked of one man daring another
to knock a chip off his shoulder. Not that she could see anything
to do about that. But Egwene&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sometimes it seemed to Nynaeve that she had forgotten
why she had left the Two Rivers in the first place. To protect
young people from her village who had been caught in Aes Sedai
webs. Not that much younger than herself&mdash;only a few years&mdash;yet the gap seemed wider when you were the village Wisdom.
Of course, the Women&rsquo;s Circle in Emond&rsquo;s Field had certainly chosen
a new Wisdom by now, but that did not make it less her village, or
them less her people. In her heart of hearts, it made her no less
the Wisdom. Somehow, though, protecting Rand and Egwene and Mat and
Perrin from Aes Sedai had become helping them survive, and finally,
without her quite realizing when or how, even that goal had been
submerged in other needs. Entering the White Tower to learn how
better to pull down Moiraine had become a burning desire to learn
how to Heal. Even her hatred for Aes Sedai meddling in people&rsquo;s
lives now coexisted with her desire to become one. Not that she
really wanted to, but it was the only way to learn what she wanted
to learn. Everything had become as tangled as one of those Aes
Sedai webs, herself included, and she did not know how to
escape.</p>

<p><em>I am still who I always have been. I</em> will
<em>help them, as much as I can</em>. &ldquo;Tonight,&rdquo; she said aloud, &ldquo;I
will use the ring.&rdquo; Sitting down on the bed, she began to pull on
her stockings. Stout wool was hardly comfortable in this heat, but
at least part of her would be decently clothed. Stout stockings,
and stout shoes. Birgitte wore brocaded slippers, and gossamer silk
stockings that surely looked cool. She put the thought firmly out
of her head. &ldquo;Just to see if Egwene <em>is</em> in the Stone. If
she isn&rsquo;t, I will come back, and we won&rsquo;t use the ring again until
the next scheduled meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne watched her, with an unblinking stare that
made her tug at her stockings in increasing discomfort. The woman
did not say a word, but her expressionless gaze implied that
Nynaeve might be lying. To Nynaeve it did. It did not help that the
thought had flittered on the edge of consciousness, that she could
easily make sure the ring was not touching her skin when she went
to sleep; there was no real reason to believe that Egwene would be
waiting in the Heart of the Stone tonight. She had never really
considered it&mdash;the thought had drifted up unbidden&mdash;but
it had been there, and made it hard to meet Elayne&rsquo;s eyes. What if
she was afraid of Moghedien? It was only good sense, however it
galled to admit it.</p>

<p><em>I will do what I must</em>. She clamped down
firmly on butterflies in the pit of her belly. By the time she
tossed the shift down over her stockings, she was eager to don the
blue dress and go out into the heat just to escape Elayne&rsquo;s
eyes.</p>

<p>Elayne was just finishing helping her with the rows
of small buttons up the back&mdash;and muttering that no one had
helped <em>her</em>, as if anyone needed help with breeches&mdash;when the wagon door banged open, letting in a wave of hot air.
Startled, Nynaeve jumped and covered her bosom with both hands
before she could stop herself. When Birgitte climbed in instead of
Valan Luca, she tried to pretend she was adjusting the
neckline.</p>

<p>Smoothing identical brilliant blue silk over her hip,
the taller woman pulled her thick black braid over one bare
shoulder with a self-pleased grin. &ldquo;If you want to draw attention;
don&rsquo;t bother fiddling. It is too obvious. Just breathe deeply.&rdquo; She
demonstrated, then laughed at Nynaeve&rsquo;s scowl.</p>

<p>Nynaeve made an effort to keep her temper. Though why
she should, she did not know. She could hardly imagine that she had
felt guilt over what had happened. Gaidal Cain was probably glad to
get away from the woman. And Birgitte got to wear her hair the way
she wanted. Not that that had anything to do with anything. &ldquo;I knew
someone like you in the Two Rivers, <em>Maerion</em>. Calle knew
every merchant&rsquo;s guard by his first name, and she certainly had no
secrets from any of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Birgitte&rsquo;s smile tightened. &ldquo;And I knew a woman like
you, once. Mathena looked down her nose at men, too, and even had a
poor fellow executed for coming on her by accident while she swam
naked. She had never even been kissed, until Zheres stole one from
her. You&rsquo;d have thought she had discovered men for the first time.
She became so besotted, Zheres had to go live on a mountain to
escape her. Watch out for the first man to kiss you. One has to
come along sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fists clenching, Nynaeve took a step toward her. Or
tried to. Somehow Elayne was in between them, hands upraised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both of you stop it this minute,&rdquo; she said, eyeing
them in turn with equal haughtiness. &ldquo;Lini always said &lsquo;Waiting
turns men into bears in a barn, and women into cats in a sack,&rsquo; but
you will stop clawing at one another right now! I will not put up
with it any longer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To Nynaeve&rsquo;s surprise, Birgitte actually blushed and
mumbled a sullen apology. To Elayne, of course, but the apology
itself was the surprise. Birgitte had chosen to stay close to
Elayne&mdash;there was no need for her to hide&mdash;but after
three days the heat was apparently affecting her as badly as it did
Elayne. For herself, Nynaeve gave the Daughter-Heir her frostiest
stare. She had managed to maintain an even disposition while they
waited, cooped up together&mdash;she had&mdash;but Elayne
certainly had no room to talk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Elayne said, still in that icy tone, &ldquo;did you
have some reason for barging in like a bull, or have you simply
forgotten how to knock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve opened her mouth to say something about cats&mdash;just a gentle reminder&mdash;but Birgitte forestalled her,
if in a tighter voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thom and Juilin are back from the town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Back!&rdquo; Nynaeve exclaimed, and Birgitte glanced at
her before returning to Elayne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not send them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; Elayne said grimly.</p>

<p>She was out of the door, Birgitte at her heels,
before Nynaeve could say a word. There was nothing for it but to
follow, grumbling to herself. Elayne had better not suddenly think
she was the one giving orders. Nynaeve had still not forgiven her
for revealing so much to the men.</p>

<p>The dry heat seemed even worse outside, for all the
sun still sat on the canvas wall around the menagerie. Sweat popped
out on her brow before she reached the foot of the ladder, but for
once she did not grimace.</p>

<p>The two men sat on three-legged stools beside the
cookfire, hair wild and coats looking as if they had rolled in the
dirt. A trickle of red ran from beneath a wadded cloth Thom was
pressing to his scalp, down across a fan of dried blood that
covered his cheek and stained one long white mustache. A purple
lump the size of a hen&rsquo;s egg stood out beside Juilin&rsquo;s eye, and he
held his thumb-thick staff of pale ridged wood in a hand roughly
wrapped with a bloody bandage. That ridiculous conical red cap,
sitting on the back of his head, appeared to have been
trampled.</p>

<p>From the noises inside the canvas walls, the horse
handlers were already at work cleaning cages, and no doubt Cerandin
was with her <em>s&rsquo;redit</em>&mdash;none of the men would go near
them&mdash;but there was relatively little stir around the wagons
as yet. Petra was smoking his long-stemmed pipe while he helped
Clarine prepare their breakfast. Two of the Chavanas were studying
some piece of apparatus with Muelin, the contortionist, while the
other pair were chatting with two of the six female acrobats Luca
had hired away from Sillia Cerano&rsquo;s show. They claimed to be
sisters named Murasaka, despite being even more disparate in looks
and coloring than the Chavanas. One of the pair lounging in
colorful silk robes with Brugh and Taeric had blue eyes and almost
white hair, the other skin nearly as dark as her eyes. Everyone
else was already garbed for the day&rsquo;s first performance, the men
bare-chested in colorful breeches, Muelin in gauzy red and a tight
matching vest, Clarine in high-necked green sequins.</p>

<p>Thom and Juilin attracted a few looks, but
fortunately no one thought it necessary to come inquire after their
health. Perhaps it was the hangdog way they sat, shoulders slumped,
eyes on the ground under their boots. Doubtless they knew they were
in for a tongue-lashing that would sear their hides. Nynaeve
certainly intended to give them one.</p>

<p>Elayne, though, gasped at the sight of them and went
running to kneel beside Thom, all the anger of a moment before
taking wing. &ldquo;What happened? Oh, Thom, your poor head. That must
hurt so. This is beyond my abilities. Nynaeve will take you inside
and see to it. Thom, you are too old to get yourself into scrapes
like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indignantly, he fended her off as best he could while
holding his compress in place. &ldquo;Leave over, child. I&rsquo;ve had worse
than this falling out of bed. Will you leave over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve was not about to do any Healing, despite
being angry enough. She planted herself in front of Juilin, fists
on her hips and a brook-no-nonsense, answer-me-right-now look on
her face. &ldquo;What do you mean, sneaking off without telling me?&rdquo; As
well to start letting Elayne know that <em>she</em> was not in
charge. &ldquo;If you had gotten your throat cut instead of a mouse on
your eye, how would we know what had happened to you? There was no
reason for you to go. None! Finding a ship has been seen to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juilin glared up at her, shoving his cap forward over
his forehead. &ldquo;Seen to, is it? Is that why the three of you have
taken to stalking about like&mdash;?&rdquo; He cut off as Thom groaned
loudly and swayed.</p>

<p>Once the old gleeman had quieted Elayne&rsquo;s concerned
flutters with protestations that it had just been a momentary pang,
that he was fit to attend a ball&mdash;and given Juilin a
significant glance he obviously hoped the women would not see&mdash;Nynaeve turned a dangerous eye back to the dark Tairen, to
learn just what it was he thought they had been stalking about
like.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good thing we did go,&rdquo; he told her instead in a
tight voice. &ldquo;Samara&rsquo;s a school of silverpike around a chunk of
bloody meat. There are mobs on every street hunting Darkfriends and
anybody else who isn&rsquo;t ready to hail the Prophet as the one true
voice of the Dragon Reborn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It started three hours or so ago, near the river,&rdquo;
Thom put in, giving in with a sigh to Elayne&rsquo;s bathing his face
with a damp cloth. He appeared to be ignoring her mutters, which
must have taken some doing, since Nynaeve could clearly hear
&ldquo;foolish old man&rdquo; and &ldquo;need someone to take care of you before you
get yourself killed&rdquo; among other things in a tone easily as
exasperated as it was fond. &ldquo;How it began, I don&rsquo;t know. I heard
Aes Sedai blamed, Whitecloaks, Trollocs, everybody but the
Seanchan, and if they knew the name, they&rsquo;d blame them, too.&rdquo; He
winced at Elayne&rsquo;s pressure. &ldquo;The last hour we were a little too
personally involved in getting clear to learn much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are fires,&rdquo; Birgitte said. Petra and his wife
noticed her pointing and stood to stare worriedly. Two dark plumes
of smoke rose above the canvas wall in the direction of the
town.</p>

<p>Juilin rose and looked Nynaeve in the eyes with a
hard gaze. &ldquo;It is time to go. Maybe we&rsquo;ll stand out enough for
Moghedien to find us, but I doubt it; there are people running
every direction they can run. In another two hours, it won&rsquo;t be a
pair of fires, it will be fifty, and avoiding her won&rsquo;t do much
good if we&rsquo;re torn to pieces by a mob. They&rsquo;ll turn to the shows
once they have smashed what can be smashed in the town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use that name,&rdquo; Nynaeve said sharply, with a
frown for Elayne that the younger woman did not see. Letting men
know too much was always a mistake. The trouble was, he was right,
but letting a man know that too quickly was a mistake, too. &ldquo;I will
consider your suggestion, Juilin. I would hate to run away for no
reason, and then learn that a ship had come right after we left.&rdquo;
He stared at her as if she were mad, and Thom shook his head
despite Elayne&rsquo;s holding it still for her washing, but a figure
making his way through the wagons brightened Nynaeve. &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s
come already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uno&rsquo;s painted eyepatch and scarred face, his topknot
and the sword on his back, attracted casual nods from Petra and the
various Chavanas and one shiver from Muelin. He had made each of
the evening visits himself, though with nothing to report. His
presence now had to mean there was something.</p>

<p>As usual he grinned at Birgitte as soon as he saw
her, and rolled his lone eye in an ostentatious stare at her
exposed bosom, and as usual she grinned back and eyed him up and
down lazily. For once, though, Nynaeve did not care how
reprehensibly they behaved. &ldquo;Is there a ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uno&rsquo;s grin faded. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bloo&mdash;a ship,&rdquo; he
said grimly, &ldquo;if I can get you to it whole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know all about the rioting. Surely fifteen
Shienarans can get us safely through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know about the rioting,&rdquo; he muttered, eyeing
Thom and Juilin. &ldquo;Do you fla&mdash;do you know Masema&rsquo;s people are
fighting Whitecloaks in the streets? Do you know he&rsquo;s bloo&mdash;he&rsquo;s ordered his people to take Amadicia with fire and sword? There
are thousands across the blo&mdash;aagh!&mdash;the river
already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may be,&rdquo; Nynaeve said firmly, &ldquo;but I
expect you to do as you said you would. You promised to obey <em>
me</em>, if you recall.&rdquo; She put just a slight emphasis on the
word, and gave Elayne a meaning look.</p>

<p>Pretending not to see, the woman stood, bloodied
washcloth in her hand, and directed her attention to Uno. &ldquo;I have
always been told that Shienarans are among the bravest soldiers in
the world.&rdquo; That razor edge to her voice had suddenly become regal
silk and honey. &ldquo;I heard many stories of Shienaran bravery when I
was a child.&rdquo; She rested a hand on Thom&rsquo;s shoulder, but her eyes
remained on Uno. &ldquo;I remember them still. I hope I shall always
remember them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Birgitte stepped closer and began massaging the back
of Uno&rsquo;s neck while she looked him straight in the eye. That
glaring red eye on his eyepatch did not seem to upset her at all.
&ldquo;Three thousand years guarding the Blight,&rdquo; she said gently.
Gently. It had been two days since she had spoken to Nynaeve like
that! &ldquo;Three thousand years, and never a step back not paid for ten
times over in blood. This may not be Enkara, or the Soralle Step,
but I know what you will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;read all the flaming
histories of the flaming Borderlands?&rdquo; Immediately he flinched and
glanced at Nynaeve. It had been necessary to tell him she expected
absolutely clean language out of him. He was not taking it well,
but there was no other way to prevent backsliding, and Birgitte
should not frown at her. &ldquo;Can you talk to them?&rdquo; he directed at
Thom and Juilin. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re fla&mdash;fools to try this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juilin flung up his hands, and Thom laughed out loud.
&ldquo;Did you ever know a woman who listened to sense when she didn&rsquo;t
want to?&rdquo; the gleeman replied. He grunted as Elayne pulled his
compress away and began dabbing at his split scalp with perhaps a
bit more force than was strictly necessary.</p>

<p>Uno shook his head. &ldquo;Well, if I&rsquo;m to be cozened, I
suppose I&rsquo;ll be cozened. But mark this. Masema&rsquo;s people found the
ship&mdash;<em>Riversnake</em>, or something like&mdash;not an
hour after it docked, but Whitecloaks seized it. That&rsquo;s what
started this little row. The bad news is the Whitecloaks still hold
the docks. The worse is, Masema may have forgotten the ship&mdash;I went to see him, and he wouldn&rsquo;t hear of ships; all he can talk
about is hanging Whitecloaks, and making Amadicia bend knee to the
Lord Dragon if he has to put the whole land to the torch&mdash;but
he hasn&rsquo;t bothered to tell all of his people. There&rsquo;s been fighting
near the river, and may still be. Getting you through the riots
will be bad enough, but if there&rsquo;s a battle at the docks, I make no
promises. And how I&rsquo;m to put you on a ship in Whitecloak hands, I
don&rsquo;t begin to know.&rdquo; Letting out a long breath, he scrubbed sweat
from his forehead with the back of a scarred hand. The strain of so
long a speech without cursing was plain on his face.</p>

<p>Nynaeve might have relented on his language at that
moment if she had not been too stunned to speak. It had to be
coincidence. <em>Light, I said anything for a ship, but I didn&rsquo;t
mean this. Not this!</em> She did not know why Elayne and Birgitte
were staring at her with such blank expressions. They had known
everything she had, and neither had brought up this possibility.
The three men exchanged frowns, obviously aware that something was
going on and just as obviously unaware what it was, for which thank
the Light. Much better when they did not know everything. It just
had to be coincidence.</p>

<p>In one way, she was more than happy to focus on
another man making his way through the wagons; it gave an excuse to
pull her eyes away from Elayne and Birgitte. In another way, the
sight of Galad made her stomach settle right to her shoes.</p>

<p>He wore plain brown and a flat velvet cap instead of
his white cloak and burnished mail, but his sword still rested on
his hip. He had not been to the wagons before, and the effect of
his face was dramatic. Muelin took an unconscious step toward him,
and the two slender acrobats leaned forward, mouths open. The
Chavanas were plainly forgotten, and scowling for it. Even Clarine
smoothed her dress as she watched him, until Petra took his pipe
from his mouth and said something. Then she went over to where he
sat, laughing, and snuggled his face to her plump bosom. But her
eyes still followed Galad over her husband&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>Nynaeve was in no mood to be affected by a handsome
face; her breath hardly quickened at all. &ldquo;It was you, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
she demanded before he even reached her. &ldquo;You seized the <em>
Riversnake</em>, didn&rsquo;t you? Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Riverserpent</em>,&rdquo; he corrected, eyeing her
incredulously. &ldquo;You did ask me to secure you passage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask you to start a riot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A riot?&rdquo; Elayne put in. &ldquo;A war. An invasion. All
begun over this vessel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Galad answered calmly. &ldquo;I gave Nynaeve my word,
sister. My first duty is to see you safely on your way to Caemlyn.
And Nynaeve, of course. The Children would have had to fight this
Prophet soon or late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you simply have let us know the ship was
here?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked wearily. Men and their word. It was all very
admirable, sometimes, but she should have listened when Elayne said
he did what he saw as right no matter who was hurt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what the Prophet wanted the ship for,
but I doubt it was so you could take passage downriver.&rdquo; Nynaeve
flinched. &ldquo;Besides which, I paid the captain your passage while he
was still unloading his cargo. An hour later, one of the two men I
left to make sure he did not sail without you came to tell me the
other man was dead and the Prophet had taken the ship. I don&rsquo;t
understand what you are so upset about. You wanted a ship, needed a
ship, and I got you one.&rdquo; Frowning, Galad addressed Thom and
Juilin. &ldquo;What is the matter with them? Why do they keep staring at
one another?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women,&rdquo; Juilin said simply, and got slapped on the
back of the head by Birgitte for his trouble. He glared at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Horseflies have a nasty bite,&rdquo; she grinned, and his
glower faded into uncertainty as he readjusted his cap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can sit here all day discussing right and wrong,&rdquo;
Thom said dryly, &ldquo;or we can take this vessel. Passage has been
paid, and there&rsquo;s no getting the price back now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve flinched again. However he meant it, she knew
how she heard it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There may be trouble reaching the river,&rdquo; Galad
said. &ldquo;I donned this clothing because the Children are not popular
in Samara at the moment, but the mobs can set on anyone.&rdquo; He eyed
Thom doubtfully, with his white hair and long white mustaches, and
Juilin a little less so&mdash;even disheveled, the Tairen looked
hard enough to pound posts&mdash;then turned to Uno. &ldquo;Where is
your friend? Another sword might be useful until we reach my
men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uno&rsquo;s smile was villainous. Clearly, there was no
more love between them than at their first meeting. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s about.
And maybe one or two more. I&rsquo;ll see them to the ship, if your
Whitecloaks can hold on to it. Or if they can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne opened her mouth, but Nynaeve spoke up
quickly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, both of you!&rdquo; Elayne would just have tried
honeyed words again. They might have worked, but she wanted to lash
out. At something, anything. &ldquo;We need to move quickly.&rdquo; She should
have considered, when she flung two madmen at the same target, what
might happen if they both hit at once. &ldquo;Uno, gather the rest of
your men, as fast as you can.&rdquo; He tried to tell her they were
already waiting on the other side of the menagerie, but she plowed
on. They <em>were</em> madmen, <em>both</em> of them. <em>All</em>
men were! &ldquo;Galad, you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rouse and rise!&rdquo; Luca&rsquo;s shout cut into her words as
he trotted between the wagons, limping, and with a bruise
discoloring the side of his face. His scarlet cape was soiled and
torn. It seemed Thom and Juilin were not the only ones to have
entered the town. &ldquo;Brugh, go tell the horse handlers to hitch the
teams! We&rsquo;ll have to abandon the canvas,&rdquo; he grimaced at the words,
&ldquo;but I mean to be on the road in under an hour! Andaya, Kuan, pull
your sisters out! Wake anybody still asleep, and if they&rsquo;re
washing, tell them to dress dirty or come naked! Hurry, unless
you&rsquo;re ready to proclaim the Prophet and march to Amadicia! Chin
Akima&rsquo;s lost his head already, along with half his performers, and
Sillia Cerano and a dozen of hers were flogged for being too slow!
Move!&rdquo; By that time, everybody except those around Nynaeve&rsquo;s wagon
were at the run.</p>

<p>Luca&rsquo;s limp slowed as he approached, eyeing Galad
warily. And Uno, for that matter, though he had seen the one-eyed
man twice before. &ldquo;Nana, I want to talk to you,&rdquo; he said, quietly.
&ldquo;Alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will not be going with you, Master Luca,&rdquo; she
told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alone,&rdquo; he said, and seized her arm, hauling her
away.</p>

<p>She looked back to tell the others not to interfere
and found there was no need. Elayne and Birgitte were hurrying off
toward the canvas wall that encompassed the menagerie, and except
for a few glances at her and Luca, the four men were engrossed in
conversation. She sniffed loudly. Fine men they were, to watch a
woman manhandled and do nothing.</p>

<p>Jerking her arm free, she strode along beside Luca,
silk skirts swishing her displeasure. &ldquo;I suppose you want your
money, now that we are going. Well, you shall have it. One hundred
gold marks. Though I think you should allow something for the wagon
and horses we&rsquo;re leaving behind. And for what we&rsquo;ve brought in. We
have certainly increased the number of your patrons. Morelin and
Juilin with their highwalking, me with the arrows, Thom&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I want the gold, woman?&rdquo; he demanded
rounding on her. &ldquo;If I did, I&rsquo;d have asked for it the day we
crossed the river! Have I asked? Did you ever think why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of herself, she took a step back, crossing
her arms beneath her breasts sternly. And immediately wished she
had not; that stance more than emphasized what she was exposing.
Stubbornness kept her arms where they were&mdash;she was not about
to let him think she was flustered, especially since she was&mdash;but surprisingly, his eyes remained on hers. Maybe he was ill. He
had never avoided looking at her bosom before, and if Valan Luca
was not interested in bosoms <em>or</em> gold&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;If not about
the gold, then why do you want to talk to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the way back here from the town,&rdquo; he said
slowly, following her, &ldquo;I kept thinking that now you would finally
go.&rdquo; She refused to back away again, even when he was standing over
her and staring down intently. At least he was still looking at her
face. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you are running from, Nana. Sometimes, I
almost believe your story. Morelin certainly has a noblewoman&rsquo;s
manner about her, at least. But you were never a lady&rsquo;s maid. The
last few days, I&rsquo;ve half expected to find the pair of you rolling
on the ground tearing one another&rsquo;s hair. And maybe Maerion in the
pile.&rdquo; He must have seen something on her face, because he cleared
his throat and hurried on. &ldquo;The point is, I can find someone else
for Maerion to shoot at. You do scream so beautifully, anyone would
think you were truly terrified, but&mdash;&rdquo; He cleared his throat
again, even more hastily, and drew back. &ldquo;What I am trying to say
is that I want you to stay. There&rsquo;s a wide world out there, a
thousand towns waiting for a show like mine, and whatever is
chasing you will never find you with me. A few of Akima&rsquo;s people,
and some of Sillia&rsquo;s who haven&rsquo;t been marched off across the river&mdash;they&rsquo;re joining me. Valan Luca&rsquo;s show will be the greatest
the world has ever seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay? Why should I stay? I told you from the first
we only wanted to reach Ghealdan, and nothing has changed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? Why, to have my children, of course.&rdquo; He took
one of her hands in both of his. &ldquo;Nana, your eyes drink my soul,
your lips inflame my heart, your shoulders make my pulse race, your&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She cut in hurriedly. &ldquo;You want to marry me?&rdquo; she
said incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marry?&rdquo; He blinked. &ldquo;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;yes. Yes,
of course.&rdquo; His voice picked up strength again, and he pressed her
fingers to his lips. &ldquo;We will be wed at the first town where I can
arrange it. I&rsquo;ve never asked another woman to marry me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can quite believe it,&rdquo; she said faintly. It took
some effort to pull her hand free. &ldquo;I am sensible of the honor,
Master Luca, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Valan, Nana. Valan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I must decline. I am betrothed to another.&rdquo;
Well, she was, in a way. Lan Mandragoran might think his signet
ring just a gift, but she saw it differently. &ldquo;And I am going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should bundle you up and carry you with me.&rdquo; Dirt
and rips somewhat spoiled the grandiloquent flourish of his cape as
he drew himself up. &ldquo;With time, you would forget the fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You try it, and I&rsquo;ll have Uno make you wish you had
been sliced for sausage.&rdquo; That barely deflated the fool man at all.
She drove a finger hard against his chest. &ldquo;You do not know me,
Valan Luca. You don&rsquo;t know anything about me. My enemies, the ones
you dismiss so easily, would make you take off your skin and dance
in your bones, and you would be grateful if that was all they did.
Now, I am going, and I don&rsquo;t have time to listen to your drivel.
No, don&rsquo;t say any more! My mind is set, and you will not change it,
so you might as well stop blathering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Luca sighed heavily. &ldquo;You are the only woman for me,
Nana. Let other men choose boring flutterers with their shy sighs.
A man would know he had to walk through fire and tame a lioness
with his bare hands every time he approached you. Every day an
adventure, and every night&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His smile almost earned him boxed
ears. &ldquo;I will find you again, Nana, and you will choose me. I know
it in here.&rdquo; Thumping his chest dramatically, he gave his cape an
even more pretentious swirl. &ldquo;And you know it, too, my dearest
Nana. In your fair heart, you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve did not know whether to shake her head or
gape. Men <em>were</em> mad. <em>All</em> of them.</p>

<p>He insisted on escorting her back to her wagon,
holding her arm as if they were at a ball.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Stalking though the turmoil of horse handlers rushing
to hitch teams, the din of men shouting, horses whickering, bears
growling, leopards coughing, Elayne found herself muttering under
her breath to match any of the animals. Nynaeve had no room to talk
about her showing her legs. She had seen the way the woman stood up
straighter when Valan Luca appeared. And breathed deeper, too. For
Galad as well, for that matter. It was not as if she <em>
enjoyed</em> wearing breeches. They <em>were</em> comfortable,
true, and cooler than skirts. She could see why Min chose to wear
men&rsquo;s clothes. Almost. There was the problem of getting past the
feeling that the coat was really a dress that barely covered your
hips. She had just managed that, so far. Not that she intended to
let Nynaeve know, her and her viperish tongue. The woman should
have realized Galad would ignore the cost of keeping his promise.
It was not as if Elayne had not told her about him often enough.
And involving the Prophet! Nynaeve just acted without thinking
about what she was doing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you say something?&rdquo; Birgitte asked. She had
gathered her skirts over one arm to keep up, unashamedly baring her
legs from blue brocaded slippers to well above her knees, and those
sheer silk stockings did not hide as much as breeches.</p>

<p>Elayne stopped dead. &ldquo;What do you think of how I am
dressed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It allows freedom of movement,&rdquo; the other woman said
judiciously. Elayne nodded. &ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s good that your bottom
isn&rsquo;t too big, as tight as those&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Striding on furiously, Elayne tugged the coat down
with sharp yanks. Nynaeve&rsquo;s tongue had nothing on Birgitte&rsquo;s. She
really should have required some oath of obedience, or at least
some show of proper respect. She would have to remember that once
it came time to bond Rand. When Birgitte caught up to her, wearing
a sour expression as if <em>she</em> were driven almost beyond
endurance, neither of them spoke.</p>

<p>Dressed in green sequins, the pale-haired Seanchan
woman was using her goad to guide the huge bull <em>s&rsquo;redit</em> as
his head pushed the heavy wagon holding the black-maned lion&rsquo;s
cage. A horse handler in a shabby leather vest held the wagon
tongue, steering the wagon around to where its horses could be
hitched more easily. The lion stalked back and forth, lashing his
tail and now and then giving a hoarse cough that sounded like the
beginning of a roar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cerandin,&rdquo; Elayne said, &ldquo;I must speak to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a moment, Morelin.&rdquo; Fixed on the tusked gray
animal as she was, her quick, slurred way of speaking made her
nearly unintelligible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Cerandin. We have little time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the woman did not halt the <em>s&rsquo;redit</em> and
turn until the horse handler called out that the wagon was in
position. Then she said impatiently, &ldquo;What do you need, Morelin? I
have much to do, yet. And I would like to change; this dress is not
for traveling.&rdquo; The animal stood waiting patiently behind her.</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s mouth tightened slightly. &ldquo;We are leaving,
Cerandin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. The riots. Such things should not be
allowed. If this Prophet thinks to harm us, he will learn what Mer
and Sanit can do.&rdquo; She twisted to scratch Mer&rsquo;s wrinkled shoulder
with her goad, and he touched her shoulder with his long nose. A
&ldquo;trunk,&rdquo; Cerandin called it. &ldquo;Some prefer <em>lopar</em> or <em>
grolm</em> for battle, but <em>s&rsquo;redit</em> properly used&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet and listen,&rdquo; Elayne said firmly. It was an
effort to maintain her dignity, with the Seanchan woman being
obtuse and Birgitte standing aside with her arms folded. She was
certain Birgitte was just waiting to say something else cutting. &ldquo;I
do not mean the show. I mean myself, and Nana, and you. We are
taking ship this morning. In a few hours, we will be beyond the
Prophet&rsquo;s reach forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cerandin shook her head slowly. &ldquo;Few river craft can
carry <em>s&rsquo;redit</em>, Morelin. Even if you&rsquo;ve found one that can,
what would they do? What would I do? I do not think I can earn as
much by myself as I can with Master Luca, not even with you
high-walking and Maerion shooting her bow. And I suppose Thom would
juggle. No. No, it is better if we all remain with the show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>s&rsquo;redit</em> will have to be left behind,&rdquo;
Elayne admitted, &ldquo;but I am sure that Master Luca will take care of
them. We will not be performing, Cerandin. There&rsquo;s no more need for
that. Where I am going, there are those who would like to learn
about&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She was conscious of the horse handler, a lanky fellow
with an incongruously bulbous nose, standing close enough to
listen. &ldquo;About where you came from. Much more than you&rsquo;ve told us
already.&rdquo; No, not listening. Leering. By turns at Birgitte&rsquo;s bosom
and at <em>her</em> legs. She looked at him until his insolent grin
turned sickly and he scuttled back to his duties.</p>

<p>Cerandin was shaking her head again. &ldquo;I am to leave
Mer and Sanit and Nerin to be cared for by men who are afraid to
come near them? No, Morelin. We will stay with Master Luca. You,
too. It is much better. Remember how bedraggled you were the day,
you came? You do not want to return to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drawing a deep breath, Elayne stepped closer. No one
but Birgitte was close enough to overhear, but she did not want to
take foolish chances. &ldquo;Cerandin, my true name is Elayne of House
Trakand, Daughter-Heir of Andor. One day, I will be Queen of
Andor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Based on the woman&rsquo;s behavior the first day, and even
more on what she had told them of Seanchan, that should have been
enough to quell any resistance. Instead, Cerandin looked her
straight in the eye. &ldquo;You claimed to be a lady the day you came,
but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Pursing her lips, she eyed Elayne&rsquo;s breeches. &ldquo;You are a
very good highwalker, Morelin. With practice, you may be good
enough to perform before the Empress one day. Everyone has a place,
and everyone belongs in their place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment, Elayne&rsquo;s mouth worked soundlessly.
Cerandin did not believe her! &ldquo;I have wasted quite enough time,
Cerandin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She reached for the woman&rsquo;s arm, to haul her along
bodily if necessary, but Cerandin caught her hand, twisted, and
with a wide-eyed yelp Elayne found herself on tiptoe, wondering
whether her wrist would break before her arm came out of her
shoulder. Birgitte just stood there, arms folded under her breasts,
and had the nerve to raise an eyebrow questioningly!</p>

<p>Elayne gritted her teeth. She <em>would</em> not ask
for help. &ldquo;Release me, Cerandin,&rdquo; she demanded, wishing she did not
sound quite so breathy. &ldquo;I said, release me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cerandin did, after a moment, and stepped back
warily. &ldquo;You are a friend, Morelin, and always will be. You could
be a lady, one day. You have the manner, and if you attract a lord,
he may take you for one of his <em>asa</em>. <em>Asa</em> sometimes become wives. Go
with the Light, Morelin. I must finish my work.&rdquo; She held out the
goad for Mer to curl his trunk around, and the big animal let her
lead him ponderously away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cerandin,&rdquo; Elayne said sharply. &ldquo;Cerandin!&rdquo; The
pale-haired woman did not look back. Elayne glared at Birgitte. &ldquo;A
great lot of help you were,&rdquo; she growled, and stalked off before
the other woman could reply.</p>

<p>Birgitte caught her up and fell in at her side. &ldquo;From
what I hear, and what I&rsquo;ve seen, you have spent considerable time
teaching the woman she has a backbone. Did you expect me to help
you take it away from her again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not trying to do any such thing,&rdquo; Elayne
muttered. &ldquo;I was trying to take care of her. She is a long way from
home, a stranger wherever she goes, and there are some who would
not treat her kindly if they learned where she came from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She seems well able to take care of herself,&rdquo;
Birgitte said dryly. &ldquo;But then, perhaps you taught her that, too?
Perhaps she was helpless before you found her.&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s stare
seemed to slide off her like ice sliding down warm steel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You just stood and watched her. You are supposed to
be my&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She glanced around; it was only a glance, but several
of the horse handlers ducked their heads away. &ldquo;My Warder. You are
supposed to help me defend myself when I cannot channel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Birgitte looked around, too, but unfortunately there
was no one close enough to make her hold her tongue. &ldquo;I will defend
you when you are in danger, but if the danger is only of being
turned over someone&rsquo;s knee because you&rsquo;ve behaved like a spoiled
child, I will have to decide whether it&rsquo;s better to let you learn a
lesson that might save you the same or worse another time. Telling
her you were heir to a throne! Really! If you are going to be Aes
Sedai, you had better start practicing how to bend the truth, not
break it into shards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne gaped. It was not until she stumbled over her
own feet that she managed to say, &ldquo;But I am!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you say so,&rdquo; Birgitte said, rolling her eyes at
the spangled breeches.</p>

<p>Elayne could not help herself. Nynaeve wielding her
tongue like a needle, Cerandin stubborn as two mules, and now this.
She threw back her head and screamed with frustration.</p>

<p>When the sound died, it seemed as if the animals had
quieted. Horse handlers stood about, staring at her. Coolly, she
ignored them. Nothing could worm its way under her skin now. She
was as calm as ice, perfectly in control of herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that a cry for help,&rdquo; Birgitte said, tilting her
head, &ldquo;or are you hungry? I suppose I could find a wet nurse in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne strode away with a snarl that would have done
any of the leopards proud.</p>
