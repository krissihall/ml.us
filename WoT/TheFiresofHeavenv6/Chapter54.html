hundred of the Maidens behind Sulin accompanied
Rand back to the Royal Palace, where Bael waited in the great court
inside the front gates with Thunder Walkers and Black Eyes and
Water Seekers and men from every other society, their numbers
filling the courtyard and crowding back into the palace through
every door down to the smallest servants&rsquo; way. Some watched from
lower windows, waiting their turn to come out. The surrounding
stone balconies were empty. In the entire courtyard only one man
waited who was not Aiel; Tairens and Cairhienin&mdash;especially
Cairhienin&mdash;stayed clear when Aiel gathered. The exception
stood above Bael on the wide gray steps leading into the place.
Pevin, with the crimson banner hanging limply from its staff, and
no more expression surrounded by Aiel than at any other time.</p>

<p>Aviendha, behind Rand&rsquo;s saddle, clung tightly to him,
breasts pressed against his back, until the very moment he
dismounted. There had been an exchange between her and some of the
Wise Ones back at the docks that he did not think he had been
supposed to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Go with the Light,&rdquo; Amys had said, touching
Aviendha&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;And guard him closely. You know how much depends
on him.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Much depends on you both,&rdquo; Bair told Aviendha,
almost at the same time that Melaine said irritably, &ldquo;It would be
easier if you had succeeded by now.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>Sorilea snorted. &ldquo;Even Maidens knew how to handle
men in my day.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>She has been more successful than you know,&rdquo; Amys told them. Aviendha shook her head; the roses-and-thorns
ivory bracelet slid down her arm as she raised a hand to forestall
the other woman, but Amys went on over her half-formed protests. &ldquo;I
have waited for her to tell us, but since she will not&mdash;&rdquo; She
saw him then, standing only ten fret away, with Jeade&rsquo;en&rsquo;s reins in
his hand, and cut oft sharply. Aviendha turned to see what Amys was
staring at; when her eyes found him, bright crimson suffused her
face, then drained away so suddenly that even her sun-dark cheeks
looked pale. The four Wise Ones fixed him with flat, unreadable
gazes.</em></p>

<p><em>Asmodean and Mat came up behind him, leading
their horses. &ldquo;Do women learn that look in the cradle?&rdquo; Mat
muttered &ldquo;Do their mothers teach them? I&rsquo;d say the mighty</em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn<em> will get his ears singed if he stays around here much
longer.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Shaking his head, Rand reached up as Aviendha swung a
leg over to slide down, and lifted her from the dapple&rsquo;s back. For
a moment he held her by the waist, looking down into her clear
blue-green eyes. She did not look away, and her expression never
changed, but her hands tightened slowly on his forearms. What
success was she supposed to have? He had thought she was set to spy
on him for the Wise Ones, but if she ever asked a question about
things he held back from the Wise Ones, it was in open anger at him
for keeping secrets from them. Never slyly, never trying to ferret
something out. Bludgeon, maybe, but never ferret. He had considered
the possibility that she was like one of Colavaere&rsquo;s young women,
but only for the brief moment it took to think of the notion.
Aviendha would never let herself be used in that way. Besides, even
if she had, giving him one taste of herself then denying him so
much as a kiss afterward, not to mention making him chase her
halfway around the world, was no way to go about it. If she was
more than casual about being naked in front of him, Aiel customs
were different. If his distress at it satisfied her, likely it was
because she thought it was a great joke to play on him. So what was
she supposed to be successful at? Plots all around him. Was
everyone scheming? He could see his face in her eyes. Who had given
her that silver necklace?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like canoodling as much as the next man,&rdquo; Mat
said, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t you think there are a few too many people
watching?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand released Aviendha&rsquo;s waist and stepped back, but
no more quickly than she. She bent her head, fussing with her
skirt, muttering about how riding had disarrayed it, but not before
he saw her cheeks redden. Well, he had not meant to embarrass
her.</p>

<p>Scowling around the courtyard, he said, &ldquo;I told you I
don&rsquo;t know how many I can take, Bael.&rdquo; With the Maidens spilling
back through the gates onto the ramp, there was barely room to move
in the courtyard. Five hundred from each society meant six thousand
Aiel; the hallways inside must be packed.</p>

<p>The towering Aiel chief shrugged. Like every other
Aiel there, he had his <em>shoufa</em> wrapped around his head,
ready to veil. No crimson headband, though it seemed at least half
the others wore the black-and-white disc on their foreheads. &ldquo;Every
spear that can follow you, will. Will the two Aes Sedai come
soon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; It was good that Aviendha kept her promise not
to let him touch her again. Lanfear had tried to kill her and
Egwene because she did not know which was Aviendha. How had Kadere
found out to tell her? No matter. Lan was right. Women found pain&mdash;or death&mdash;when they came too close to him. &ldquo;They will
not be coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are stories of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;trouble&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;by the
river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great victory, Bael,&rdquo; Rand said wearily. &ldquo;And much
honor earned.&rdquo; <em>But not by me</em>. Pevin came down past Bael to
stand behind Rand&rsquo;s shoulder with the banner, his narrow, scarred
face absolutely blank. &ldquo;Does the whole palace know about this,
then?&rdquo; Rand asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard,&rdquo; Pevin said. His jaw worked, chewing for
more words. Rand had found him a replacement for his patched
country coat, good red wool, and the man had had Dragons
embroidered on it, one climbing either side of his chest. &ldquo;That you
were going. Somewhere.&rdquo; That seemed to exhaust his store.</p>

<p>Rand nodded. Rumors grew in the palace like mushrooms
in the shade. But as long as Rahvin did not find out. He scanned
the tile roofs and tower-tops. No ravens. He had not seen a raven
in some time, though he heard of other men killing them. Perhaps
they avoided him now. &ldquo;Stand ready.&rdquo; He seized <em>saidin</em>,
floated in emptiness, emotionless.</p>

<p>The gateway appeared at the foot of the steps, first
a bright line that seemed to <em>turn</em>, opening into a square
hole into blackness four paces wide. Not a murmur came from the
Aiel. Those beyond would be able to see him as through a smoked
glass, a dusky shimmering in the air, but they could as well try
walking through one of the palace walls. From the side, the gateway
would be invisible except to the few close enough to see what might
seem a long, fine hair drawn tight.</p>

<p>Four paces was as large as Rand could make it. There
were limits for one man by himself, Asmodean claimed; it seemed
there were always limits. The amount of <em>saidin</em> you drew
did not matter. The One Power had little to do with gateways,
really; only the making. Beyond, was something else. A dream of a
dream, Asmodean called it.</p>

<p>He stepped through onto what appeared to be a paving
stone lifted from the courtyard, but here the gray square hung in
the midst of utter darkness, with a sense that in every direction
there was nothing. Nothing, forever. It was not like night. He
could see himself and the stone perfectly. But everything else,
everywhere else, was blackness.</p>

<p>It was time to see how large he could make a
platform. With the thought, more stones appeared all at once,
duplicating the courtyard to an inch. He imagined it larger still.
That quickly, gray stone stretched as far as he could see. With a
start, he realized that his boots were beginning to sink into the
stone under his feet; it looked no different, yet it yielded slowly
like mud, oozing up around his boots. Hastily, he brought
everything back to a square the size of what was outside&mdash;that much stayed solid&mdash;then began increasing it by one outer
row of stones at a time. It did not take long to realize he could
not make the platform much larger than his first attempt. The stone
still looked all right, it did not sink beneath his feet, but the
second added row felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;insubstantial, like a thin shell that
might crack at a wrong step. Was that because this was as large as
the thing could be made? Or because he had not thought of it larger
at first? <em>We all make our limits</em>. The thought slid up
surprisingly from somewhere. <em>And we set them further out than
we have any right</em>.</p>

<p>Rand felt himself shiver. In the Void, it seemed like
feeling someone else shiver. It was well to be reminded that Lews
Therin was still inside him. He had to be careful not to fall into
a battle for self while confronting Rahvin. If not for that, he
might have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;No. What had happened on the quay was done; he
would not make a hash of it for breakfast.</p>

<p>Reducing the platform by one outer ring of square
stones, he turned. Bael was waiting out there in what seemed a huge
square doorway into daylight with the steps beyond. At his side,
Pevin looked no more perturbed by what he saw than the Aiel chief,
which was to say not at all. Pevin would carry that banner wherever
Rand went, even the Pit of Doom, and never blink. Mat shoved back
his hat to scratch his head, then jerked it low again, muttering
something about dice in his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impressive,&rdquo; Asmodean said quietly. &ldquo;Quite
impressive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flatter him some other time, harper,&rdquo; Aviendha said.
She was the first to step through, watching Rand, not where she put
her feet. She walked all the way to him without once so much as
glancing at anything except his face. When she reached him, though,
it was to swing away abruptly, settling her shawl over her elbows,
and study the darkness. Sometimes women were stranger than anything
else the Creator could possibly have made.</p>

<p>Bael and Pevin came right behind her; then Asmodean,
one hand clutching the strap of his harpcase across his chest, the
other white-knuckled on his sword hilt; and Mat, swaggering, but a
trifle reluctant and grumbling as if arguing with himself. In the
Old Tongue. Sulin claimed the honor to be first else, but soon a
wide stream followed, not just Maidens of the Spear, but <em>Tain
Shari</em>, True Bloods, and <em>Far Aldazar Din</em>, Brothers of
the Eagle; Red Shields and Dawn Runners, Stone Dogs and Knife
Hands, representatives of every society, crowding through.</p>

<p>As the numbers increased, Rand moved to the far side
of the platform from the gateway. There was no need to see where he
was going, really, but he wanted to. In truth, he could have
remained at the other end, or gone to one side; direction here was
mutable; whatever way he chose to move would take him to Caemlyn if
done properly. And to the endless black of nowhere if done
wrong.</p>

<p>Except for Bael and Sulin&mdash;and Aviendha, of
course&mdash;the Aiel left a little space around him and Mat,
Asmodean and Pevin. &ldquo;Stay away from the edge,&rdquo; Rand said. The Aiel
nearest him moved back all of a foot. He could not see over the
forest of <em>shoufa</em>-shrouded heads. &ldquo;Is it full?&rdquo; he called.
The thing might hold half those who wanted to go, but not many
more. &ldquo;Is it full?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; a woman&rsquo;s voice called back finally,
reluctantly&mdash;he thought it sounded like Lamelle&mdash;but
there was still a milling in the gateway, Aiel sure there must be
room for one more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; Rand shouted. &ldquo;No more! Clear the gateway!
Everyone stand well clear!&rdquo; He did not want what had happened to
the Seanchan spear to happen here to living flesh.</p>

<p>A pause, and then, &ldquo;It is clear.&rdquo; It <em>was</em>
Lamelle. He would have bet his last copper that Enaila and Somara
were back there somewhere, too.</p>

<p>The gateway seemed to turn sideways, thinning until
it vanished with one final flash of light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood and ashes!&rdquo; Mat muttered, leaning disgustedly
on his spear. &ldquo;This is worse than the flaming Ways!&rdquo; Which earned
him a startled look from Asmodean, and a considering one from Bael.
Mat did not notice; he was too busy glaring at the blackness.</p>

<p>There was no sense of motion, no breeze to stir the
banner Pevin held. They could have been standing still. But Rand
knew better; he could almost feel the place they were approaching
draw nearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you come out too close to him, he will sense it.&rdquo;
Asmodean licked his lips and avoided looking at anyone. &ldquo;At least,
that is what I have heard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know where I am going,&rdquo; Rand said. Not too close.
But not too far. He remembered the spot well.</p>

<p>No movement. Endless black, and them hanging in it.
Motionless. Half an hour passed perhaps.</p>

<p>A slight stir ran through the Aiel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Rand asked.</p>

<p>Murmurs came across the platform. &ldquo;Someone fell,&rdquo; a
bulky man near him said at last. Rand recognized him. Meciar. He
was <em>Cor Darei</em>, a Night Spear. He wore the red
headband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not one of the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Rand began, then caught Sulin
looking at him, flat-eyed.</p>

<p>He turned to stare out into the darkness, anger a
stain clinging to the emotionless Void. So it was not supposed to
matter more to him if one of the Maidens had fallen, was it? It
did. Falling forever through endless black. Would sanity crack
before death came, from starvation or thirst or fear? In that fall,
even an Aiel must eventually find fear strong enough to stop a
heart. He almost hoped so; it must be more merciful than the
other.</p>

<p><em>Burn me, what happened to all that hardness I was
so proud of? A Maiden or a Stone Dog, a spear is a spear</em>.
Only, thinking it could not make it so. <em>I</em> will <em>be
hard</em>. He would let the Maidens dance the spears where they
wished. He would. And he knew he would search out the name of every
one who died, that every name would be another knife-cut on his
soul. <em>I will be hard. The Light help me, I will. The Light help
me</em>.</p>

<p>Seemingly motionless, hanging in blackness.</p>

<p>The platform stopped. It was hard to say how he knew,
when he could tell it was moving before, but he did.</p>

<p>He channeled, and a gateway opened in the same way it
had in the courtyard in Cairhien. The angle of the sun had hardly
changed, but here early-morning light shone on a paved street, and
a rising slope patched brown with drought-killed grass and
wildflowers, a slope topped by a stone wall two spans high or more,
the stones worked rough so it seemed something natural. Above that
wall he could see the golden domes of the Royal Palace of Andor, a
few of the pale spires topped with banners rippling the White Lion
on a breeze. On the other side of that wall was the garden where he
had first met Elayne.</p>

<p>Blue eyes floated accusingly outside the Void, the
darting memory of kisses stolen in Tear, the memory of a letter
laying her heart and soul at his feet, of messages borne by Egwene
professing love. What would she say if she ever learned about
Aviendha, about that night together in the snow hut? Memory of
another letter, icily spurning him, a queen condemning a swineherd
to outer darkness. It did not matter. Lan was right. But he wanted&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What? Who? Blue eyes, and green, and dark brown. Elayne, who
maybe loved him and maybe could not make up her mind? Aviendha, who
taunted him with what she would not let him touch? Min, who laughed
at him, thought him a wool-headed fool? All that flashed along the
boundaries of the Void. He tried to ignore it, to ignore anguished
memories of another blue-eyed woman, lying dead in a palace
corridor, so long ago.</p>

<p>He had to stand there, while Aiel dashed out behind
Bael, veiling themselves, spreading left and right. It was his
presence that maintained the platform; it would vanish as soon as
he stepped through the gateway. Aviendha waited almost as calmly as
Pevin, though she did occasionally put her head out to frown
faintly in one direction or the other down the street. Asmodean
fingered his sword and breathed too quickly; Rand wondered whether
the man knew how to use the thing. Not that he would have to. Mat
stared up the wall as though at a bad remembrance. He had entered
the palace this way once, too.</p>

<p>The last veiled Aiel went by, and Rand motioned the
others out, then followed. The gateway winked out of existence,
leaving him in the middle of a long circle of wary Maidens. Aiel
were running down the curving street&mdash;it followed the line of
the hill; all the streets of the Inner City flowed with the land&mdash;vanishing around winding corners as they hurried to find and
secure anyone who might give alarm. More were climbing the slope,
and some had even begun to scale the wall, using tiny knobs and
ridges for finger- and toe-holds.</p>

<p>Suddenly Rand stared. To his left the street bowed
downward and rounded out of sight, the decline giving a view past
tile-covered towers, sparkling in the morning sun with a hundred
changing colors, across tile roofs all the way to one of the Inner
City&rsquo;s many parks, its white walks and monuments forming a lion&rsquo;s
head when seen from this angle. To his right the street rose a
little before curving away, more towers topped by spires or domes
of various shapes glittering above the rooftops. Aiel filled the
street, fanning out quickly into side streets that spiraled away
from the palace. Aiel, and not a soul else. The sun was high enough
for people to be out and about their business, even this close to
the palace.</p>

<p>Like a nightmare the wall above toppled outward in
half a dozen places, Aiel and stones smashing down on those still
climbing. Before those bouncing, sliding chunks of masonry reached
the streets, Trollocs appeared in the openings, dropping the
tree-thick battering rams they had used and drawing scythe-curved
swords&mdash;more, with spiked axes and barbed spears, huge
man-shapes in black mail with spikes at shoulders and elbows, huge
man-faces distorted by snouts and muzzles, beaks and horns and
feathers, plunging down the slope with eyeless Myrddraal like
midnight serpents in their midst. All along the street howling
Trollocs and silent Myrddraal poured from doorways, leaped from
windows. Lightning stabbed from the cloudless sky.</p>

<p>Rand wove Fire and Air to meet Fire and Air, a
slow-spreading shield racing lightnings&rsquo; fall. Too slow. One bolt
struck the shield directly above his head, shattering in a blinding
glare, but others grounded themselves, and his hair lifted as the
air itself seemed to hammer him down. Almost he lost the weave,
almost the Void itself, but he wove what he could not see through
eyes still filled with coruscating light, spread the shield
against bolts from the heavens that he could at least feel
hammering at it. Hammering to reach him, but that could change.
Drawing <em>saidin</em> through the <em>angreal</em> in his pocket,
he wove the shield until he was sure it must cover half of the
Inner City, then tied it off. As he pushed himself to his feet,
sight began to return, watery and painful at first. He had to move
fast. Rahvin knew he was here. He had to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Surprisingly little time had passed, seemingly.
Rahvin had not cared how many of his own he took. Stunned Trollocs
and Myrddraal on the slope were falling to spears in the hands of
Maidens, many of whom moved unsteadily themselves. Some Maidens,
those nearest Rand, were only now pulling themselves up from where
they had been flung, and Pevin stood spraddle-legged, holding
himself upright with the red banner&rsquo;s staff, his scarred face still
blank as slate. More Trollocs boiled through the gaps in the wall
above, and the din of battle filled the streets in all directions,
but it might as well have been in another country so far as Rand
was concerned.</p>

<p>There had been more than one bolt in that first
volley, but not all had been aimed at him. Mat&rsquo;s smoking boots lay
a dozen paces from where Mat himself sprawled on his back. Tendrils
of smoke rose from the black haft of his spear, too, from his coat,
even from the silver foxhead, hanging out of his shirt, that had
not saved him from a man&rsquo;s channeling. Asmodean was a twisted shape
of char, recognizable only from the blackened harpcase still
strapped to his back. And Aviendha&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Unmarked, she could have
laid down to rest&mdash;if she could have rested staring
unblinking at the sun.</p>

<p>Rand bent to touch her cheek. Cooling already. It
felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Not like flesh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;RAAAAHVIIIIN!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It startled him a little, that sound coming from his
throat: He seemed to be sitting somewhere deep in the back of his
own head, the Void around him vaster, emptier, than it had ever
been before. <em>Saidin</em> raged through him. He did not care if
it scoured him away. The taint seeped through everything, tarnished
everything. He did not care.</p>

<p>Three Trollocs broke past the Maidens, great spiked,
axes and oddly hooked spears in hairy hands, all-too human eyes
fixing on him, standing there apparently unarmed. The one with a
boar&rsquo;s tusked snout went down with Enaila&rsquo;s spear through its
spine. Eagle&rsquo;s beak and bear&rsquo;s muzzle raced on toward him, one on
booted feet, the other on paws.</p>

<p>Rand felt himself smile.</p>

<p>Fire burst from the two Trollocs, a flame at every
pore, bursting through black mail. Even as their mouths opened to
scream, a gateway opened right where they stood. Bloody halves of
burning, cleanly sliced Trolloc fell, but Rand was staring through
the opening. Not into blackness, but a great columned hall with
lion-carved stone panels, where a large man with wings of white in
his dark hair started up in surprise from a gilded throne. A dozen
men, some dressed as lords, some in breastplates, turned to see
what their master was looking at.</p>

<p>Rand barely noticed them. &ldquo;Rahvin,&rdquo; he said. Or
someone did. He was not sure who.</p>

<p>Sending fire and lightning ahead of him, he stepped
through and let the gateway close behind him. He was death.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Nynaeve was having no trouble maintaining the temper
that allowed her to channel a flow of Spirit to the amber sleeping
woman in her pouch. Even the feel of unseen eyes could not touch
her through her anger this morning. Siuan stood in front of her on
a Salidar street in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, a street empty save
for them, a few flies, and one fox that paused to look at them
curiously before trotting on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must concentrate,&rdquo; Nynaeve barked. &ldquo;You had more
control than this the first time. Concentrate!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>am</em> concentrating, you fool girl!&rdquo; Siuan&rsquo;s
plain blue wool dress was suddenly silk. The seven-striped stole of
the Amyrlin Seat hung around her neck, and a golden serpent bit its
own tail on her finger. Frowning at Nynaeve, she did not seem aware
of the change, though she had already worn the same five times
today. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any difficulty, it lies in that foul-tasting
brew you fed me! Faagh! I can still taste it. Like flatfish gall.&rdquo;
Stole and ring vanished; the silk dress&rsquo;s high neck plunged low
enough to show the twisted stone ring, dangling between her breasts
on a fine gold chain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t insist on me teaching you when you
needed something to help you sleep, you wouldn&rsquo;t need it.&rdquo; So there
had been a little sheepstongue root and a few other things that
were not really necessary in the mix. The woman deserved to have
her tongue curdled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can hardly teach me when you&rsquo;re teaching Sheriam
and the others.&rdquo; The silk paled; the neck was high again,
surrounded by a white lace ruff, and a cap of pearls fitted close
on Siuan&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;Or would you rather I came after them? You claim
you need <em>some</em> sleep undisturbed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve quivered, fists clenched at her sides.
Sheriam and the others were not the worst thing stoking her anger.
She and Elayne took turns bringing them to <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>
two at a time, sometimes all six in one night, and even if she was
the teacher they never let her forget she was Accepted and they Aes
Sedai. One sharp word when they made a foolish mistake&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Elayne
had only been sent to scrub pots once, but Nynaeve&rsquo;s hands were
shriveled from hot, soapy water; back where her body lay sleeping
they were, anyway.</p>

<p>But they were not the worst. Nor was the fact that
she barely had a moment to spare for investigating what, if
anything, could be done about stilling and gentling. Logain was
more cooperative than Siuan and Leane in any case, or at least more
eager. Thank the Light he understood about keeping it secret. Or
thought he did; he probably believed she would Heal him eventually.
No, worse than that was that Faolain had been tested and raised&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;not Aes Sedai&mdash;not without the Oath Rod, which was tight in
the Tower&mdash;but to something more than Accepted. Faolain wore
any dress she chose now, and if she could not wear the shawl or
choose an Ajah, she had been given other authority. Nynaeve thought
she had fetched more cups of water, more books&mdash;left
deliberately, she, was sure!&mdash;more pins and ink-jars and
other useless things in the last four days than she had her entire
stay in the Tower. Yet even Faolain was not the worst of all. She
did not even want to remember that. Her anger could have heated a
house in winter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s put a hook in your gills today, girl?&rdquo; Siuan
had on a gown like those Leane wore, only more sheer than even
Leane would ever wear in public, so thin it was hard to tell what
color it was. Not the first time she had had that on today, either.
What was perking around in the back of the woman&rsquo;s mind? In the
World of Dreams, things like these changes of clothing betrayed
thoughts you might not even know you had. &ldquo;You have been almost
decent company until today,&rdquo; Siuan continued irritably, then
paused. &ldquo;Until today. I see it now. Yesterday afternoon Sheriam
assigned Theodrin to begin helping you break down that block you&rsquo;ve
built up. Is that what has your shift in a twist? You don&rsquo;t like
Theodrin telling you what to do? She&rsquo;s a wilder, too, girl. If
anyone can help you learn to channel without eating nettles first,
she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what has you so jittery you can&rsquo;t hold your
dress still?&rdquo; Theodrin&mdash;that was what really hurt. The
failure. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s something I heard last night?&rdquo; Theodrin was
even-tempered, good-humored, patient; she said it could not be done
in one session; her own block had taken months to demolish, and she
had finally realized she was channeling long before going to the
Tower. Still, failure hurt, and worst of all, if anyone ever
discovered that she had cried like a baby in Theodrin&rsquo;s comforting
arms when she knew she was failing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;I heard you heaved Gareth
Bryne&rsquo;s boots at his head when he told you to sit down and polish
them properly&mdash;he still doesn&rsquo;t know Min does the polishing,
does he?&mdash;so he turned you upside down and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan&rsquo;s full-armed slap rung her ears. For an instant
she could only stare at the other woman, eyes going wider and
wider. With a wordless shriek, she tried to punch Siuan in the eye.
Tried, because somehow Siuan had tangled a fist in her hair. A
moment later they were down in the dirt of the street, rolling
about and screaming, flailing wildly.</p>

<p>Grunting, Nynaeve thought she was getting the better
of it even if she did not know whether she was on the top or the
bottom half the time. Siuan was trying to yank her braid out by the
roots with one hand while the other pounded at her ribs or anything
else it could find, but she had the other woman the same way, and
Siuan&rsquo;s yanking and punching were definitely growing weaker, and
she herself was going to pound Siuan senseless in another minute,
then snatch her bald. Nynaeve yelped as a toe caught her hard on
the shin. The woman kicked! Nynaeve tried to knee her, but it was
not easy in skirts. Kicking was not fighting fair!</p>

<p>Suddenly Nynaeve realized that Siuan was shaking. At
first she thought the woman was crying. Then she realized it was
laughter. Pushing herself up, she brushed strands of hair out of
her face&mdash;her braid was all but undone&mdash;and glared down
at the other woman. &ldquo;What are you laughing at? Me? If you are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at you. At us.&rdquo; Still quivering with mirth,
Siuan shoved Nynaeve off her. Siuan&rsquo;s hair was in wild disarray,
and dust covered the plain wool dress she wore now, worn-looking
and neatly darned in several places. She was barefoot, too. &ldquo;Two
grown women, rolling around like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I haven&rsquo;t done that since I
was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;twelve, I think. I started thinking that all we needed
would be fat Cian snatching me up by an ear to tell me girls don&rsquo;t
fight. I heard she once knocked down a drunken printer, I don&rsquo;t
know why.&rdquo; Something very like giggles took her for a moment, then
she quieted them and stood, brushing dust from her clothes. &ldquo;If we
have a disagreement, we can settle it like adult women.&rdquo; And in a
careful tone, &ldquo;Still, it might be a good idea not to discuss Gareth
Bryne.&rdquo; She gave a start as the worn dress became a gown, red with
black-and-gold embroidery around hem and swooping neckline.</p>

<p>Nynaeve sat there staring at her. What would she have
done as Wisdom if she found two women rolling around in the dirt
that way? If anything, the answer kept her anger at a simmer. Siuan
still did not seem to realize that there was no need to brush away
dust with your hands in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. Snatching away
fingers that had been repairing her braid, Nynaeve got up quickly;
before she was on her feet again, her braid hung perfect over her
shoulder and her good Two Rivers woolens might have just been
laundered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; she said. She would have made any two
women she caught like that sorry they had been born even before she
hauled them before the Women&rsquo;s Circle. What was she doing lashing
out with her fists like some fool man? First Cerandin&mdash;she
did not want to think about that episode, but there it was&mdash;then Latelle, and now this. Was she going to get around her block
by being angry all the time? Unfortunately&mdash;or perhaps
fortunately&mdash;that thought did nothing for her temper. &ldquo;If we
have disagreements, we can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;discuss them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which I suppose means we&rsquo;ll shout at one another,&rdquo;
Siuan said dryly. &ldquo;Well, better that than the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We would not have to shout if you&mdash;!&rdquo; Drawing a
deep breath, Nynaeve jerked her eyes away; this was no way to begin
anew. That breath caught in her throat, and she turned her head
back to Siuan so quickly it seemed she had been shaking it. She
hoped it did. Just for an instant, there had been a face in a
window across the Street. And there was a flutter in her belly, a
bubble of fear, a burn of anger at being afraid. &ldquo;I think we should
go back now,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go back! You said that vile concoction would put me
to sleep for a good two hours, and we haven&rsquo;t been here much more
than half that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time works differently here.&rdquo; Had it been Moghedien?
The face had vanished so quickly it could have been someone
dreaming herself here for an instant. If it was Moghedien, they
must not&mdash;must not on any account&mdash;let her know she had
been seen. They had to get away. Bubble of fear, burn of anger. &ldquo;I
told you. A day in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> can be an hour in the
waking world, or the other way round. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve dipped better out of the bilge in a bucket,
girl. You needn&rsquo;t think you can get away with shortchanging me.
You&rsquo;ll teach me everything you teach the others, as agreed. We can
go when I wake up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no time. If it had been Moghedien. Siuan&rsquo;s
dress was green silk now, and the Amyrlin&rsquo;s stole and her Great
Serpent ring were back, but for a wonder the neckline was almost as
low as anything she had worn before. The ring <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>
hung above her breasts, somehow part of a necklace of square
emeralds.</p>

<p>Nynaeve moved without thinking. Her hand lashed out,
snatched the necklace so hard it tore free from Siuan&rsquo;s neck.
Siuan&rsquo;s eyes widened, but as soon as the clasp broke, she vanished,
and necklace and ring melted from Nynaeve&rsquo;s hand. For an instant
she stared at her empty fingers. What happened to someone sent out
of <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> like that? Had she sent Siuan back to
her sleeping body? Or to somewhere else? To nowhere?</p>

<p>Panic seized her. She was just standing there. Quick
as thought she fled, the World of Dreams seeming to change around
her.</p>

<p>She stood on a dirt street in a small village of
wooden houses, none more than a single story. The White Lion of
Andor waved from a tall staff, and a single stone dock stuck out
into a broad river where a flock of long-billed birds flapped south
low over the water. It all looked vaguely familiar, but it took her
a moment to know where she was. Jurene. In Cairhien. And that river
was the Erinin. It had been here that she and Egwene and Elayne had
boarded the <em>Darter</em>, as badly misnamed as the <em>
Riverserpent</em>, to continue their journey to Tear. That time
seemed like something read in a book long ago.</p>

<p>Why had she jumped to Jurene? That was simple, and
answered as soon as she thought of it. Jurene was the one place she
knew well enough to leap to in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> that she
could be sure Moghedien did not know. They had been there for an
hour, before Moghedien knew she existed, and she was sure neither
she nor Elayne had ever mentioned it again, in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> or awake.</p>

<p>But that left another question. The same one, in a
way. Why Jurene? Why not step out of the Dream, wake up in her own
bed, such as it was, if washing dishes and scrubbing floors on top
of everything had not left her so weary she slept right on? <em>I
can still step out</em>. Moghedien had seen her in Salidar, if that
had been Moghedien. Moghedien knew Salidar now. <em>I can tell
Sheriam</em>. How? Admit she was teaching Siuan? She was not
supposed to have her hands on those <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> except
with Sheriam and the other Aes Sedai. How Siuan got hold of them
when she wanted, Nynaeve did not know. No, she was not afraid of
more hours up to her elbows in hot water. She was afraid of
Moghedien. Anger burned in her belly fiercely. She wished she had
some goosemint out of her scrip of herbs. <em>I am so</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>so</em> bloody <em>tired of being afraid</em>.</p>

<p>There was a bench in front of one of the houses,
overlooking dock and river. She sat down and considered her
situation from every angle. It was ridiculous. The True Source was
a pale thing. She channeled a flame dancing in air above her hand.
<em>She</em> might look solid&mdash;to herself, anyway&mdash;but
she could see the river through that scrap of fire. She tied it
off, and it faded away like mist as soon as the knot was done. How
could she face Moghedien when the weakest novice in Salidar could
match or better her strength? That was why she had fled here
instead of leaving <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. Afraid and angry at
being afraid, too angry to think straight, to consider her own
weakness.</p>

<p>She would step out of the Dream. Whatever Siuan&rsquo;s
scheme had been, it was done; she would have to take her chances
right along with Nynaeve. The thought of more hours scrubbing
floors tightened her hand on her braid. Days more likely, and maybe
Sheriam&rsquo;s switch besides. They might never let her near one of the
dream <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> again, or any <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. They
would set Faolain over her instead of Theodrin. A finish to
studying Siuan and Leane, much less Logain; maybe a finish to
studying Healing.</p>

<p>In a fury she channeled another flame. If it was a
whit stronger, she could not see it. So much for trying to crank
her anger in hope it would help. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing for it but to
just tell them I saw Moghedien,&rdquo; she muttered, yanking her braid
hard enough to hurt. &ldquo;Light, they <em>will</em> give me to Faolain.
I&rsquo;d almost rather die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you seem to enjoy running little errands for
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That mocking voice pulled Nynaeve up off the bench
like hands on her shoulders. Moghedien stood in the street all in
black, shaking her head at what she saw. With all her strength
Nynaeve wove a shield of Spirit and hurled it between the other
woman and <em>saidar</em>. Tried to hurl it between; it was like
chopping at a tree with a paper hatchet. Moghedien actually smiled
before she bothered to slice Nynaeve&rsquo;s weave, and that as casually
as brushing a biteme away from her face. Nynaeve stared at her as
though poleaxed. After everything it came down to this. The One
Power, useless. All the anger bubbling inside her, useless. All her
plans, her hopes, useless. Moghedien did not bother to strike back.
She did not even bother to channel a shield of her own. That was
how much contempt she had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was afraid you had seen me. I grew careless when
you and Siuan started trying to kill each other. With your hands.&rdquo;
Moghedien gave a belittling laugh. She was weaving something,
lazily because there was no reason to hurry. Nynaeve did not know
what it was, yet she wanted to scream. Fury seethed inside her, but
fear dulled her wits, rooted her feet to the ground. &ldquo;Sometimes I
think you are all too ignorant even to train, you and the former
<em>Amyrlin Seat</em> and all the rest. But I cannot allow you to
betray me.&rdquo; That weave was reaching out for her. &ldquo;It is time to
collect you at last, it seems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold, Moghedien!&rdquo; Birgitte shouted.</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s mouth dropped open. It <em>was</em>
Birgitte, as she had been, in her short white coat and wide yellow
trousers, intricate golden braid pulled over her shoulder, silver
arrow drawn on silver bow. It was impossible. Birgitte was no
longer part of <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, she was back in Salidar,
making sure no one discovered Nynaeve and Siuan asleep with the sun
up and began asking questions.</p>

<p>Moghedien was so shocked, the flows she had woven
vanished. Shock lasted less than a moment, though. The gleaming
arrow flew from Birgitte&rsquo;s bow&mdash;and evaporated. The bow evaporated.
Something seemed to seize the archer, jerking her arms straight up,
pulling her clear of the ground. Almost immediately she was snubbed
short, pulled tight between wrists and ankles a foot above the
ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have considered the possibility of you.&rdquo;
Moghedien turned her back on Nynaeve to move closer to Birgitte.
&ldquo;Do you enjoy your flesh? Without Gaidal Cain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve thought of channeling. But what? A dagger
that might not even penetrate the woman&rsquo;s skin? Fire that would not
singe her skirts? Moghedien knew how useless she was; she was not
even looking at her. If she stopped the flow of Spirit to the
sleeping woman in amber, she would wake in Salidar, she could give
warning. Her face twisted near to tears as she looked at Birgitte.
The golden-haired woman hung there, staring defiantly at Moghedien.
Moghedien contemplated her in return as a woodcarver would a block
of wood.</p>

<p><em>There&rsquo;s only me</em>, Nynaeve thought. <em>I
might as well not be able to channel at all. There&rsquo;s only
me</em>.</p>

<p>Lifting that first foot was like pulling it out of
knee-deep mud, the second staggering step no easier. Toward
Moghedien. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt me,&rdquo; Nynaeve cried. &ldquo;Please. Don&rsquo;t hurt me.&rdquo;
A chill ran through her. Birgitte was gone. A child of perhaps
three or four, in short white coat and wide yellow trousers, stood
there playing with a toy-sized silver bow. Flipping her golden
braid back, the child aimed the bow at Nynaeve and giggled, then
stuck a finger in her mouth as though unsure whether she had done
something wrong. Nynaeve sagged to her knees. It was hard work
crawling in skirts, but she did not think she could have remained
standing. Somehow she managed, reaching out a pleading hand and
whimpering. &ldquo;Please. Don&rsquo;t hurt me. Please. Don&rsquo;t hurt me.&rdquo; Over
and over as she dragged toward the Forsaken, a broken beetle
scrabbling in the dirt.</p>

<p>Moghedien watched silently, until at last she said,
&ldquo;Once I thought you were stronger than this. Now I find I truly
like the sight of you on your knees. That is close enough, girl.
Not that I think you have courage enough to try tearing <em>my</em>
hair out&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She seemed amused by the notion.</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s hand wavered a span from Moghedien. It had
to be close enough. There was only her. And <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. The image formed in her head, and there it
was, silver bracelet on her outstretched wrist, silver leash
linking it to the silver collar around Moghedien&rsquo;s neck. It was not
just the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> she fixed in her head, but Moghedien
wearing it, Moghedien and the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>, a part of <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> that she held in the form she wanted. She knew
something of what to expect; she had worn an <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>&rsquo;s
bracelet briefly once, in Falme. In a strange way she was aware of
Moghedien in the same way she was aware of her own body, her own
emotions, two sets, each distinct, but each in her own head. One
thing she had only hoped, because Elayne insisted it was so. The
thing was indeed a link; she could feel the Source <em>through</em>
the other woman.</p>

<p>Moghedien&rsquo;s hand leaped to the collar, shock rounding
her eyes. Rage and horror. Rage more than horror, at first. Nynaeve
felt them almost as if they were her own. Moghedien had to know
what the leash-and-collar was, yet she tried to channel anyway; at
the same time Nynaeve felt a slight shifting in herself, in the
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em>, as the other woman tried to bend <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> to herself. Suppressing Moghedien&rsquo;s attempt was
simple; the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> was a link, with her in control. Knowing
that made it easy. Nynaeve did not want to channel those flows, so
they were not channeled. Moghedien might as well have tried to pick
up a mountain with her bare hands. Horror overwhelmed rage.</p>

<p>Getting to her feet, Nynaeve fastened the proper
image in her mind. She did not just imagine Moghedien leashed in
the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>, she <em>knew</em> Moghedien was leashed, as
firmly as she knew her own name. The sense of shifting, of her skin
trying to crawl, did not go away, though. &ldquo;Stop that,&rdquo; she said
sharply. The <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> did not move, but it seemed to tremble
unseen. She thought of blackwasp nettles lightly brushing the other
woman from shoulders to knees. Moghedien shuddered, exhaled
convulsively. &ldquo;Stop it, I said, or I&rsquo;ll do worse.&rdquo; The shifting
ceased. Moghedien watched her warily, still clutching the silver
collar around her neck and with an air of being poised on her toes
for flight.</p>

<p>Birgitte&mdash;the child who was, or had been,
Birgitte&mdash;stood eyeing them curiously. Nynaeve formed the
image of her as a grown woman, concentrated. The little girl put
her finger back in her mouth and began studying the toy bow.
Nynaeve breathed angrily. It was hard changing what someone else
was already maintaining. And on top of that, Moghedien had claimed
she could make changes permanent. But what she could do, she could
undo. &ldquo;Restore her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you release me, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve thought of nettles again, and not a light
brush this time. Moghedien sucked air through clenched teeth, shook
like a bedsheet in a high wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Birgitte said, &ldquo;was the most frightening
thing that has ever happened to me.&rdquo; Herself once more, she wore
the short coat and wide trousers, but she had no bow or quiver. &ldquo;I
<em>was</em> a child, but at the same time, what was me&mdash;really me&mdash;was just some fancy floating in the back of that
child&rsquo;s mind. And I knew it. I knew I was just going to watch what
happened and play&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Flipping her golden braid back over her
shoulder, she gave Moghedien a hard look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked. &ldquo;I am
grateful, you understand, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;how?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Birgitte gave Moghedien a final stony stare, then
opened her coat to fish in the neck of her blouse, pulling up the
twisted stone ring on a leather thong. &ldquo;Siuan woke up. Just for a
moment, and not all the way. Long enough to grumble about you
snatching this from her. When you didn&rsquo;t wake right behind her, I
knew something must be wrong, so I took the ring and the last of
what you mixed for Siuan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was hardly any left. Only the dregs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough to put me to sleep. It tastes horrible, by
the way. After that, it was as easy as finding feather-dancers in
Shiota. In some ways this is almost as if I were still&mdash;&rdquo;
Birgitte cut off with another glare for Moghedien. The silver bow
reappeared in her hand, and a quiver of silver arrows at her hip,
yet after one moment they vanished again. &ldquo;Past is past, and the
future is ahead,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;I was not truly surprised to
realize there were two of you who knew they were in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. I knew the other must be her, and when I
arrived and saw the pair of you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It seemed as if she had
already captured you, but I hoped that if I distracted her, you
might come up with something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve felt a stab of shame. She had considered
abandoning Birgitte. That was what she had almost come up with. The
thought had only been there for a moment, rejected as soon as it
came, but it had come. What a coward she was. Surely Birgitte never
had even moments when fear almost took control of her. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; A
faint taste of boiled catfern and powdered mavinsleaf. &ldquo;I almost
ran away,&rdquo; she said faintly. &ldquo;I was so frightened my tongue stuck
to the roof of my mouth. I almost ran away and left you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Nynaeve writhed inside as Birgitte considered
her. &ldquo;But you did not, did you? I should have loosed before I
called out, but I&rsquo;ve never felt comfortable shooting anyone from
behind. Even her. Still, it all worked out. But what do we do with
her now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moghedien certainly seemed to have overcome her fear.
Ignoring the silver collar around her throat, she watched Nynaeve
and Birgitte as though they were the prisoners, not she, and she
was deliberating what to do with them. Except for an occasional
twitch of her hands, as if she wanted to scratch where her skin
held the memory of nettles, she appeared black-clad serenity. Only
the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> let Nynaeve know there was fear in the woman,
almost a gibbering, but pushed down to a muted buzz. She wished the
thing let her know what Moghedien was thinking as well as feeling.
Then again, she was just as glad not to be inside the mind behind
those cold dark eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before you consider anything&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;drastic,&rdquo;
Moghedien said, &ldquo;remember that I know much that would be useful to
you. I have observed the other Chosen, peeked into their schemes.
Is that not worth something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, and I will consider whether it&rsquo;s worth
anything,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. What could she do with the woman?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lanfear, Graendal, Rahvin and Sammael are plotting
together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave the leash a short tug, staggering her.
&ldquo;I know that. Tell me something new.&rdquo; The woman was captive here,
but the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> only existed so long as they were in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know they are drawing Rand al&rsquo;Thor to attack
Sammael? But when he does, he will find the others as well, waiting
to trap him between them. At least, he will find Graendal and
Rahvin. I think Lanfear plays another game, one the others know
nothing about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve exchanged worried glances with Birgitte. Rand
must learn of this. He would, as soon as she and Elayne could speak
to Egwene tonight. If they could manage to put their hands on the
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> long enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is,&rdquo; Moghedien murmured, &ldquo;if he lives long
enough to find them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve took hold of the silvery leash where it
joined the collar and pulled the Forsaken&rsquo;s face close to hers.
Dark eyes met her gaze flatly, but she could feel anger through the
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em>, and fear wriggling up and being stamped down. &ldquo;You
listen to me. Do you think I don&rsquo;t know why you are pretending to
be so cooperative? You think if you keep talking long enough, I
will make some slip, and you can escape. You think the longer we
talk, the harder I&rsquo;ll find it to kill you.&rdquo; That much was true
enough. To kill somebody in cold blood, even one of the Forsaken,
would be hard, maybe harder than she could manage. What was she
going to do with the woman? &ldquo;But you understand this. I won&rsquo;t allow
hinting at things. If you try keeping anything back from me, I will
do to you everything you ever thought of doing to me.&rdquo; Dread,
creeping through the leash, like bone-chilling shrieks deep in
Moghedien&rsquo;s mind. Maybe she did not know as much about <em>
a&rsquo;dam</em> as Nynaeve thought. Maybe she believed Nynaeve could
read her thoughts if she tried. &ldquo;Now if you know of some threat to
Rand, something ahead of Sammael and the others, you tell me.
Now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Words spilled from Moghedien&rsquo;s mouth, and her tongue
flickered out to wet her lips continually. &ldquo;Al&rsquo;Thor means to go
after Rahvin. Today. This morning. Because he thinks Rahvin killed
Morgase. I don&rsquo;t know whether he did or not, but al&rsquo;Thor believes
it. But Rahvin never trusted Lanfear. He never trusted any of them.
Why should he? He thought it all might be some trap set for him, so
he has laid a trap of his own. He has set Wards through Caemlyn so
if a man channels a spark he will know. Al&rsquo;Thor will walk right
into it. He almost certainly already has. I think he meant to leave
Cairhien right after sunrise. I had no part of it. It was none of
it my doing. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve wanted to shut her up; the fear sweat
glistening on the woman&rsquo;s face made her sick, but if she had to
listen to that pleading voice, too&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She started to channel,
wondering whether she would be strong enough to hold Moghedien&rsquo;s
tongue, then smiled. She was linked to Moghedien, and in control.
Moghedien&rsquo;s eyes bulged as she wove flows to stop her own mouth and
tied them. Nynaeve added plugs for her ears too, before turning to
Birgitte. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne&rsquo;s heart will break. She loves her
mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that!&rdquo; Nynaeve took a breath. &ldquo;I will cry
with her and mean every tear, but right now I must worry about
Rand. I think she was telling the truth. I could almost feel it.&rdquo;
She caught the silver leash just below her bracelet and shook it.
&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s this, and maybe it was imagination. What do you
believe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That it&rsquo;s the truth. She was never very brave unless
she clearly had the upper hand, or thought she could get it. And
you certainly put the fear of the Light into her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve grimaced. Birgitte&rsquo;s every word put another
bubble of anger in her belly. She was never very brave except when
she clearly had the upper hand. That could describe herself. She
had put the fear of the Light into Moghedien. She had, and she had
meant every word when she said it. Boxing somebody&rsquo;s ears when they
needed it was one thing; threatening torture, wanting to torture,
even Moghedien, was something else again. And here she was trying
to avoid what she knew she had to do. Never very brave except when
she clearly had the upper hand. This time the bubble of anger was
seeded by herself. &ldquo;We have to go to Caemlyn. I do, at least. With
her. I may not be able to channel strongly enough to tear paper as
I am, but with the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> I can use her strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be able to affect anything in the waking
world from <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>,&rdquo; Birgitte said quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know! I know, but I have to do something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Birgitte threw back her head and laughed. &ldquo;Oh,
Nynaeve, it is such an embarrassment being associated with such a
coward as you.&rdquo; Abruptly her eyes widened in surprise. &ldquo;There
wasn&rsquo;t much of your potion left. I think I am wak&mdash;&rdquo; In
mid-word, she was simply no longer there.</p>

<p>Taking a deep breath, Nynaeve untied the flows around
Moghedien. Or made her do it; with the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> it was hard
to tell which, really. She wished Birgitte was still there. Another
pair of eyes. Someone who probably knew <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>
better than she ever could. Someone who was brave. &ldquo;We are taking a
trip, Moghedien, and you are going to help me with every last scrap
of you. If anything takes me by surprise&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Suffice it to say,
anything that happens to the one wearing this bracelet happens to
the one wearing the collar. Only about tenfold.&rdquo; The sickly look on
Moghedien&rsquo;s face said she believed. Which was just as well, since
it was true.</p>

<p>Another deep breath, and Nynaeve began forming the
image of the one place in Caemlyn she knew well enough to remember.
The Royal Palace, where Elayne had taken her. Rahvin must be there.
But in the waking world, not the World of Dreams. Still, she had to
do something. <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> changed around her.</p>
