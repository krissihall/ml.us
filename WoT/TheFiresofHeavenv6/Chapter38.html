<h4><em>An Old Acquaintance</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ith
the crowds, it took Nynaeve some little time to
catch up, muttering every time she was jostled by a man gaping at
everything in sight or a woman dragging a child with either hand,
children usually trying to drag <em>her</em> to two different
attractions at once. The one-eyed man barely paused to look at
anything except the big snake and the lions, until he reached the
boar-horses. He had to have seen them earlier, situated as they
were near the patrons&rsquo; entrance. Every time the <em>s&rsquo;redit</em>
stood on their hind legs, as they were doing now, the great tusked
heads of the adults could be seen by those outside the canvas
fence, and the press to enter intensified a little more.</p>

<p>Beneath a wide red sign that said <span class="smallcaps">valan luca</span>
in ornate gold script on both sides, two of the horse handlers
collected admission from people funneled between two thick ropes,
taking the money in clear blown-glass pitchers&mdash;both thick
and flawed; Luca would never lay out coin for better&mdash;so they
could see that the coins were right without touching them. They
dumped the money straight from the pitchers through a hole in the
top of an iron-strapped box so wrapped about with chain that Petra
had to have put it in place before the first silver penny went in.
Another pair of horse handlers&mdash;thick-shouldered,
broken-nosed men with the sunken knuckles of brawlers&mdash;stood
nearby with cudgels to make sure that the crowd remained orderly.
And to keep an eye on the men taking the money, Nynaeve suspected.
Luca was not a trusting man, especially when it came to coin. In
fact, he was as tight as the skin on an apple. She had never met
anyone so stingy.</p>

<p>Slowly she elbowed close to the man with the
gray-streaked topknot. <em>He</em> had had no trouble reaching the
front rank before the <em>s&rsquo;redit</em>, of course; his scar and
painted eye-patch would have seen to that, even without the sword
on his back. At the moment he was watching the big gray animals
with a grin, and what she supposed was wonder on that stony
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uno?&rdquo; She thought that was the right name.</p>

<p>His head turned to stare at her. Once she had the
shawl back in place, he raised the stare to her face, but no
recognition lit in his dark eye. The other, the painted red glaring
one, made her a little queasy.</p>

<p>Cerandin waved her goad, shouting something slurred
beyond intelligibility, and the <em>s&rsquo;redit</em> turned, Sanit, the
cow, placing her feet, on Mer&rsquo;s broad, rounded back while he
remained upright. Nerin, the calf, put her feet low on Sanit&rsquo;s
back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw you in Fal Dara,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;And again on
Toman Head, briefly. After Falme. You were with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She did not
know how much she could say with people cheek-by-jowl around her,
rumors of the Dragon Reborn had circulated all through Amadicia,
and some even had his name right. &ldquo;With Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uno&rsquo;s real eye narrowed&mdash;she tried not to see
the other&mdash;and after a moment he nodded. &ldquo;I remember the
face. I never forget a flaming pretty face. But the hair was bloody
well different. Nyna?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve,&rdquo; she told him sharply.</p>

<p>He shook his head, eyeing her up and down, and before
she could say another word, he had seized her arm and was all but
dragging her out through the entrance. The horse handlers there
recognized her, of course, and the broken-nosed fellows started
forward hefting their cudgels. She waved them away furiously even
as she was yanking her arm free; it took three tries, and still it
was more a matter of his letting go. The man had a grip like iron.
The men with the clubs hesitated, then drifted back to their places
when they saw Uno drop his grip. Apparently they knew what Valan
Luca would prefer them to be guarding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think you are doing?&rdquo; she demanded, but
Uno only motioned her to follow, watching to see that she did so
without more than slowing his stride through the crowd waiting to
get in. He had slightly bowed legs, and moved like a man more used
to the back of a horse than his own feet. Growling to herself, she
picked up her skirts and stalked after him toward the town.</p>

<p>Two other menageries were set up behind brown canvas
walls not far off, and beyond them more lay scattered among the
crowded shanty villages. None too close to the city walls, though.
Apparently the governor, as they called the woman Nynaeve would
have named mayor&mdash;though she had never heard of a woman mayor&mdash;had decreed half a mile as the distance, to protect the town in
case any of the animals got loose.</p>

<p>The sign over the entrance to the nearest show said
<span class="smallcaps">mairin gome</span> in florid green and gold. Two women were
clearly visible above the sign, clinging to a rope hanging from a
tall framework of poles that had not been there when Luca&rsquo;s walls
went up. Apparently the boar-horses&rsquo; rearing high enough to be seen
was having an effect. The women contorted themselves into positions
that made Nynaeve think uncomfortably of what Moghedien had done,
and somehow even managed to hold themselves out in horizontal
handstands to either side of the rope. The crowd waiting
impatiently in front of Mistress Gome&rsquo;s sign was almost as large as
the one in front of Luca&rsquo;s. None of the other shows had anything
visible that she could see, and their crowds were much smaller.</p>

<p>Uno refused to answer her questions or say a word or
do more than give her dire frowns until they were out of the jam of
people and onto a cart path of hard-packed dirt. &ldquo;What I am flaming
trying to do,&rdquo; he growled then, &ldquo;is to take you where we can
flaming well talk without you being torn to flaming bits by flaming
folk trying to kiss your flaming hem when they find out you flaming
know the Lord Dragon.&rdquo; There was no one within thirty paces of
them, but he still stared around for anyone who might hear. &ldquo;Blood
and bloody ashes, woman! Don&rsquo;t you know what these flaming
goat-heads are like? Half of them think the Creator talks to him
over bloody supper every night, and the other half think he <em>is</em> the
bloody Creator!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will thank you to moderate your language, Master
Uno. And I will thank you to slow down, too. We are not running a
footrace. Where are you going, and why should I stir another step
with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rolled his eye toward her, chuckling wryly. &ldquo;Oh, I
do remember you. The one with the fla&mdash;the mouth. Ragan
thought you could skin and butcher a blo&mdash;a bull at ten paces
with your tongue. Chaena and Nangu thought fifty.&rdquo; At least he did
shorten his stride.</p>

<p>Nynaeve stopped dead. &ldquo;Where and why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Into the town.&rdquo; He did not stop. He strode right on,
flipping a hand for her to follow. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re
flam&mdash;what you&rsquo;re doing here, but I remember you were mixed up
with that <em>blue</em> woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Snarling under her breath, she gathered her skirts
and hurried after him again; it was the only way to hear. He
continued as if she had been beside him the whole time. &ldquo;This is no
blood&mdash;no place for you to be. I can scrape together enough
blo&mdash;aagh!&mdash;enough coin to get you to Tear, I think.
Rumor says that&rsquo;s where the Lord Dragon is.&rdquo; Again he looked around
warily. &ldquo;Unless you want to go to the island instead.&rdquo; He must have
meant Tar Valon. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s blo&mdash;there&rsquo;s odd rumors floating
around about that, too. Peace, if there aren&rsquo;t!&rdquo; He came from a
land that had not known peace in three thousand years; Shienarans
used the word as talisman and oath both. &ldquo;They say the old
Amyrlin&rsquo;s been deposed. Executed maybe. Some say they fought&mdash;and burned the whole&mdash;&rdquo; He paused, taking a deep breath and
grimacing horribly &ldquo;the whole city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walking along, she studied him in amazement. She had
not seen him in nearly a year, had never spoken more than two words
together to him, and yet he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Why did men always think a woman
needed a man to look after her? Men could not lace up their own
shirts without a woman to help! &ldquo;We are doing quite well as we are,
thank you. Unless you know when a river trader will dock on his way
downriver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We? Is the blue woman with you, or the brown?&rdquo; That
had to be Moiraine and Verin. He was certainly being cautious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Do you remember Elayne?&rdquo; He gave a blunt nod,
and a mischievous impulse seized her; nothing seemed to faze the
man, and he obviously expected to just take charge of her welfare.
&ldquo;You saw her again just now. You said she had a&rdquo;&mdash;she made
her voice gruff in imitation of his&mdash;&ldquo;face like a bloody
queen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stumbled in a quite satisfactory way, and glared
around him so fiercely that even two Whitecloaks riding by skirted
wide around him, though they tried to pretend he had nothing to do
with it, of course. &ldquo;Her?&rdquo; he growled incredulously. &ldquo;But her
bloody hair was black as a raven&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He glanced at hers, and
the next minute he was pacing up the cart path again, muttering
half to himself, &ldquo;The flaming woman is daughter to a queen. A
bloody queen! Showing her bloody legs that way.&rdquo; Nynaeve nodded in
agreement. Until he added, &ldquo;You bloody southlanders are bloody
strange! No flaming decency at all!&rdquo; He had fine room to talk.
Shienarans might dress properly, but she still blushed to remember
that in Shienar men and women bathed together as often as not, and
thought no more of it than of eating together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did your mother never teach you to talk decently,
man?&rdquo; His real eye frowned at her almost as darkly as the painted
one, and he rolled his shoulders. In Fal Dara he and everyone else
had treated her as nobly born, or the next thing to. Of course, it
was hard to pass herself off as a lady in that dress, and with her
hair a shade that nature never made. She arranged her shawl more
snugly and folded her arms to hold it in place. The gray wool was
terribly uncomfortable in that dry heat, and she herself was not
feeling very dry at all; she had never heard of anyone who died of
sweating, but she thought she might well be the first. &ldquo;What are
you doing here, Uno?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked around before answering. Not that he had
need; there was little traffic on the path&mdash;an occasional
ox-drawn cart, a few folk in farm clothes or rougher, here and
there a man on a horse&mdash;and no one seemed willing to come any
closer to him than they had to. He appeared a man who might cut
somebody&rsquo;s throat on a whim. &ldquo;The blue woman gave us a name in
Jehannah, and said we were to wait there until she sent
instructions, but the woman in Jehannah was dead and buried when we
arrived. An old woman. Died in her sleep, and none of her relatives
had ever heard the blue woman&rsquo;s name. Then Masema started talking
to people, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, there was no point staying there for
orders we&rsquo;d never hear if they did come. We stay close to Masema
because he slips us enough to live on, though none except Bartu and
Nengar listen to his trash.&rdquo; The grizzled topknot swung as he shook
his head in irritation.</p>

<p>Suddenly Nynaeve realized that there had not been a
single obscene word in that. He looked about to swallow his tongue.
&ldquo;Perhaps if you cursed only occasionally?&rdquo; She sighed. &ldquo;Maybe once
every other sentence?&rdquo; The man smiled at her so gratefully that she
wanted to throw up her hands in exasperation. &ldquo;How is it that
Masema has money when the rest of you do not?&rdquo; She remembered
Masema: a dark sour man who liked no one and nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s the bloody Prophet they&rsquo;ve all come to
hear. Would you like to meet him?&rdquo; He gave the impression of
counting his sentences. Nynaeve breathed deeply; the man was going
to take her literally. &ldquo;He might find you a flaming boat, if you
want one. In Ghealdan, what the Prophet wants, the Prophet usually
gets. No, he always flaming gets it in the end, one way or another.
The man was a good soldier, but who&rsquo;d have ever thought he would
turn out like this?&rdquo; His frown took in all the rude villages and
the people, even the shows and the city ahead.</p>

<p>Nynaeve hesitated. The dreaded Prophet, rousing mobs
and riots, was Masema? But he <em>did</em> preach the coming of the
Dragon Reborn. They were almost to the town gate, and there was
time yet before she must stand up and let Birgitte shoot arrows at
her. Luca had been more than disappointed that the woman insisted
on being called Maerion. If Masema <em>could</em> find a boat
heading downriver&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Today, maybe. On the other hand, there <em>
were</em> the riots. If rumor inflated them tenfold, then only
hundreds had died in towns and cities farther north. Only
hundreds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t remind him that you have anything to do
with that bloody island,&rdquo; Uno went on, eyeing her thoughtfully. Now
that she thought of it, she realized that he very likely did not
know what her connection to Tar Valon actually was. Women did go
there without becoming Aes Sedai, after all, to seek help or
answers. He was aware that she was involved in some way, but no
more than that. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t much friendlier to women from there than
the Whitecloaks are. If you just keep your mouth bloody well shut
about it, he&rsquo;ll likely pass it over. For somebody who comes from
the same village as the Lord Dragon, Masema will probably have a
flaming boat <em>built</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crowds were thicker at the city gates, flanked by
squat gray towers, men and women streaming in and out, afoot and
mounted, in every sort of garb from rags to embroidered silk coats
and dresses. The gates themselves, thick and iron-bound, stood open
under the guard of a dozen spearmen in scaled tunics and round
steel caps with flat rims. Actually, the guards paid more attention
to half their number of Whitecloaks lounging nearby than to
anything else. It was the men in snowy cloaks and burnished mail
who watched the flow of people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do the Whitecloaks cause much trouble?&rdquo; she asked
quietly.</p>

<p>Uno pursed his lips as if to spit, glanced at her,
and did not. &ldquo;Where do they bloody not? There was a woman with one
of these traveling shows who did tricks, sleight of hand. Four days
ago a flaming mob of pigeon-gutted sheep-heads tore the show
apart.&rdquo; Valan Luca had certainly never mentioned that! &ldquo;Peace!
What they wanted was the woman. Claimed she was&rdquo;&mdash;he glowered
at the folk hurrying by, and lowered his voice&mdash;&ldquo;Aes Sedai.
And a Darkfriend. Broke her bloody neck getting her to a rope, so I
hear, but they hung her corpse anyway. Masema had the ringleaders
beheaded, but it was Whitecloaks whipped up the bloody mob.&rdquo; His
scowl matched the-red eye painted on his patch. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been too
many flaming hangings and beheadings, if you bloody well ask me.
Bloody Masema&rsquo;s as bad as the bloody Whitecloaks when it comes to
finding a Darkfriend under every flaming rock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once every other sentence,&rdquo; she murmured, and the
man actually blushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo; he grumped, coming to
a stop. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t take you in there. It&rsquo;s half festival and half riot,
with a cutpurse every third step and a woman not safe out-of-doors
after dark.&rdquo; He sounded more scandalized about the last than the
rest; in Shienar, a woman was safe anywhere, any time&mdash;except
from Trollocs and Myrddraal, of course&mdash;and any man would die
to see it so. &ldquo;Not safe. I&rsquo;ll take you back. When I find a way,
I&rsquo;ll come for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That settled it for her. Pulling her arm loose before
he could get a grip on it, she quickened her pace toward the gates.
&ldquo;Come along, Uno, and do not dawdle. If you dawdle, I will leave
you behind.&rdquo; He caught up to her, grumbling under his breath about
the stubbornness of women. Once she understood that that was his
subject, and that apparently he did not think her injunction
against cursing held when talking to himself, she stopped
listening.</p>
