<h4><em>Sallie Daera</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
halo of greatness, blue and gold, flickered
fitfully around Logain&rsquo;s head, though he rode slumped in his
saddle. Min did not understand why it had appeared more often of
late. He no longer even bothered to lift his eyes from the weeds in
front of his black stallion to the low, wooded hills rolling by all
around them.</p>

<p>The other two women rode together a little ahead,
Siuan as awkward on shaggy Bela as she had ever been, Leane guiding
her gray mare deftly, with knees more than reins. Only an
unnaturally straight ribbon of ferns, poking through the
leaf-covered forest floor, hinted that there had ever been a road
here. The lacy ferns were withering, and the leaf mold rustled and
crackled dryly under the horses&rsquo; hooves. Thickly woven branches
gave a little shelter from the noonday sun, but it was hardly
cool. Sweat rolled down Min&rsquo;s face, despite an occasional breeze
that stirred from behind them.</p>

<p>Fifteen days now they had ridden west and south from
Lugard, guided only by Siuan&rsquo;s insistence that she knew exactly
where they were heading. Not that she shared her destination, of
course; Siuan and Leane were as closemouthed as sprung bear traps.
Min was not even sure that Leane actually knew. Fifteen days, while
towns and villages grew fewer and farther between, until finally
there were none. Day by day Logain&rsquo;s shoulders had sagged a little
more, and day by day the halo appeared more often. At first he had
only begun muttering that they were chasing Jak o&rsquo; the Mists, but
Siuan had regained her leadership without opposition as he turned
more and more inward. For the past six days he had not seemed to
have the energy to care where they were going or whether they would
ever get there.</p>

<p>Siuan and Leane talked quietly up ahead, now. All Min
could hear was a barely audible murmur that might as well have been
the wind in the leaves. And if she tried to ride closer, they would
tell her to keep an eye on Logain, or simply stare at her until
only a stone-blind fool could keep her nose where it did not
belong. They had done both often enough. From time to time, though,
Leane twisted in her saddle to look at Logain.</p>

<p>Finally Leane let Moonflower fall back beside his
black stallion. The heat did not seem to be bothering her; not so
much as a sheen of perspiration marred her coppery face. Min reined
Wildrose aside to give her room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be long now,&rdquo; Leane told him in a sultry
voice. He did not look up from the weeds in front of his horse. She
leaned closer, holding his arm for balance. Pressing against it,
really. &ldquo;A little while longer, Dalyn. You will have your revenge.&rdquo;
His eyes stayed dully on the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dead man would pay more notice,&rdquo; Min said, and
meant it. She had been taking notes in her head of everything Leane
did, and talking with her of an evening, though trying not to let
on why. She would never be able to behave the way that Leane did&mdash;<em>not unless I had enough wine in me that I couldn&rsquo;t think
at all</em>&mdash;yet a few pointers might come in handy. &ldquo;Maybe
if you kissed him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leane shot her a glare that could have frozen a
rushing stream, but Min merely looked back. She had never had the
problems with Leane that she did with Siuan&mdash;well, not as
many, anyway&mdash;and the few difficulties had grown less since
the other woman had left the Tower. Much fewer since they had begun
discussing men. How could you be intimidated by a woman who had
told you in dead seriousness that there were one hundred and seven
different kisses, and ninety-three ways to touch a man&rsquo;s face with
your hand? Leane actually seemed to believe these things.</p>

<p>Min had not meant it as a jibe, really, the
suggestion of a kiss. Leane had been cooing at him, giving him
smiles that should have made steam rise from his ears, since the
day he had had to be hauled out of his blankets instead of rising
first to chivvy the rest of them. Min did not know whether Leane
actually felt something for the man, though she did find it hard to
credit even the possibility, or was just trying to keep him from
giving up and dying, to keep him alive for whatever Siuan had
planned.</p>

<p>Leane certainly had not given up flirting with others
besides him. She and Siuan had apparently worked out that Siuan
would deal with women, Leane with men, and so it had been ever
since Lugard. Her smiles and glances had twice gotten them rooms
where the innkeeper had said there were none, lowered the bill at
those and three more, and on two nights earned barns instead of
bushes for sleeping. They had also gotten the four of them chased
off by one farmwife with a pitchfork, and a breakfast of cold
porridge <em>thrown</em> at them by another, but Leane had thought
the incidents funny, if no one else did. The last few days,
however, Logain had stopped reacting like every other man who saw
her for more than two minutes. He had stopped reacting to her or
anything else.</p>

<p>Siuan pulled Bela back stiffly, elbows out and
managing to look on the point of falling off any moment. The heat
was not touching her, either. &ldquo;Have you viewed him today?&rdquo; She
hardly glanced at Logain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is still the same,&rdquo; Min said patiently. Siuan
refused to understand or believe, however many times she told her,
and so did Leane. It would not have mattered if she had not seen
the aura since her first viewing of it in Tar Valon. Had Logain
been lying in the road, rasping his death tattle, she would have
wagered all she had and more on a miraculous recovery, somehow. The
appearance of an Aes Sedai to Heal him. Something. What she saw was
always true. It always happened. She knew the same way that she had
known the first time she saw Rand al&rsquo;Thor that she would fall
desperately, helplessly in love with him, the same way she had
known she would have to share him with two other women. Logain was
destined for glory such as few men had dreamed of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you take that tone with me,&rdquo; Siuan said, that
blue-eyed gaze sharpening. &ldquo;It is bad enough we have to spoon-feed
this great hairy carp to make him eat, without you going sulky as a
fisher-bird in winter. I may have to put up with him, girl, but if
you start giving me trouble too, you will regret it in short order.
Do I make myself clear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mara.&rdquo; <em>At least you could have put a touch
of sarcasm in it</em>, she thought scornfully. <em>You don&rsquo;t have
to be meek as a goose. You&rsquo;ve told Leane off to her face</em>. The
Domani woman had suggested that she practice what they had been
discussing on a farrier in the last village. A tall, handsome man,
with strong-looking hands and a slow smile, but still&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;I will
try not to be sulky.&rdquo; The worst part was that she realized she had
tried to sound sincere. Siuan had that effect. Min could not even
begin to imagine Siuan discussing how to smile at a man. Siuan
would look a man in the eye, tell him what to do, and expect to see
it done promptly. Just the way she did with everyone else. If she
did anything else, as she had with Logain, it would only be because
the point did not matter enough to press.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not much farther, is it?&rdquo; Leane said briskly.
She saved the other voice for men. &ldquo;I do not like the look of him,
and if we have to stop for another night&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, if he helps
any less than he did this morning, I don&rsquo;t know that we will be
able to get him into his saddle again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much, if those last directions I had are right.&rdquo;
Siuan sounded irritated. She had asked questions at that last
village, two days ago&mdash;not letting Min hear, of course;
Logain had showed no interest&mdash;and she did not like to be
reminded of them. Min could not understand why. Siuan could hardly
expect Elaida to be behind them.</p>

<p>She herself hoped it was not much farther. It was
hard to be sure how far south they had drifted since leaving the
highway to Jehannah. Most villagers had only vague notions of where
their village actually was in relation to anything except the
nearest towns, but when they crossed the Manetherendrelle into
Altara, just before Siuan took them away from the well-traveled
road, the grizzled old ferryman had been studying a tattered map
for some reason, a map that stretched as far as the Mountains of
Mist. Unless her estimate was off, they were going to reach another
wide river in not many miles. Either the Boern, which meant they
were already into Ghealdan, where the Prophet and his mobs were, or
else the Eldar, with Amadicia and Whitecloaks on the far side.</p>

<p>She was betting on Ghealdan, Prophet or no Prophet,
and even that was a surprise if they really were close. Only a fool
would think to find a gathering of Aes Sedai any nearer to Amadicia
than they had to be, and Siuan was anything but that. Whether they
were in Ghealdan or Altara, Amadicia had to be not many miles
distant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentling would have to catch up to him now,&rdquo; Siuan
muttered. &ldquo;If he can only hang on a few more days&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Min kept
her mouth shut; if the woman would not listen, there was no use in
speaking.</p>

<p>Shaking her head, Siuan heeled Bela back into the
lead, gripping her reins as though expecting the stout mare to
bolt, and Leane returned to silken-voiced cajoling of Logain. Maybe
she did have feelings for him; it would be no odder a choice than
Min&rsquo;s own.</p>

<p>Forested hills slid on by with never a sign of
change, all trees and tangles of weeds and brambles. The ferns that
marked the old road ran on, arrow-straight; Leane had said the soil
was different where the road had been, as if Min should have known
that. Squirrels with tufted ears sometimes chattered at them from a
branch, and occasionally birds called. Which birds, Min could not
begin to guess. Baerlon might not be a city when compared to
Caemlyn or Illian or Tear, but she thought of herself as a city
woman; a bird was a bird. And she did not care what kind of dirt a
fern grew in.</p>

<p>Her doubts began to surface again. They had oozed up
more than once after Kore Springs, but back then it had been easier
to push them down. Since Lugard they had bubbled to the top more
often, and she found herself considering Siuan in ways she would
never have dared, once. Not that she had the nerve to actually
confront Siuan with any of them, of course; it galled her to admit
that, even to herself. But maybe Siuan did not know where she was
going. She could lie, since stilling broke her away from the Three
Oaths. Maybe she was still just hoping that if she continued
searching she would find some trace of what she needed desperately
to find. In a small way, a peculiar way surely, Leane had begun
making a life for herself apart from concerns of power and the
Power and Rand. Not that she had abandoned them entirely, but Min
did not think there was anything else for Siuan. The White Tower
and the Dragon Reborn were the whole of her life, and she would
hold to them even if she had to lie to herself.</p>

<p>Woodland gave way to a large village so quickly that
Min stared. Sweetgum and oak and scrubby pine&mdash;those were
trees she could recognize&mdash;running to within fifty paces of
thatch-roofed houses made of rounded river stones and clinging to
low hills. She was willing to wager that not so long ago the forest
had grown right through. A good many trees actually stood in narrow
little thickets among some of the houses, crowding against the
walls, and here and there unweathered stumps stood close by the
front of a house. The streets still had a look of new-turned earth,
not the hard-packed surface that came from generations of feet. Men
in their shirtsleeves were up laying new thatch atop three large
stone cubes that had to have been inns&mdash;one actually had the
remains of a faded, weathered sign dangling above the door&mdash;yet no old thatch lay anywhere that she could see. There were far
too many women out and about for the number of men in sight, and
far too few children playing for the number of women. The smells of
midday cooking in the air were the only normal things about the
place.</p>

<p>If the first glimpse startled Min, when she really
saw what lay in front of her she nearly fell out of her saddle. The
younger women, shaking blankets from a window or hurrying on some
errand, wore plain woolen dresses, but no village of any size had
ever contained so many women in riding dresses of silk or fine
wool, in every color and cut. Around those women, and around most
of the men, auras and images floated before her eyes, changing and
flickering; most people rarely had anything for her viewing, but
Aes Sedai and Warders seldom lacked an aura for as much as an hour.
The children must have belonged to Tower servants. Aes Sedai who
married were few and far between, but knowing them, they would have
made every effort to bring their servants, with their families, out
of any place they felt that they must flee themselves. Siuan had
found her gathering.</p>

<p>There was an eerie stillness as they rode into the
village. No one spoke. Aes Sedai stood without moving, watching
them, and so did younger women and girls who must be Accepted or
even novices. Men who a moment before had been moving with wolfish
grace were frozen, one hand hidden in thatch, or reaching into a
doorway, doubtless where weapons were hidden. The children
vanished, hurriedly herded away by the adults who had to be
servants. Under all those unwinking stares, the hair on the back of
Min&rsquo;s neck tried to stand up.</p>

<p>Leane appeared uneasy, casting sidelong glances at
the people they rode past, but Siuan stayed smooth-faced and calm
as she led the way straight to the largest inn, the one with the
unreadable sign, and scrambled down to tie Bela to the iron ring of
one of the stone hitching posts that appeared to have been only
recently set upright. Helping Leane help Logain to the ground&mdash;Siuan never offered a hand in getting him up or down&mdash;Min found her eyes darting around. Everyone staring, no one
moving. &ldquo;I never expected to be greeted like a long-lost daughter,&rdquo;
she murmured to the other woman, &ldquo;but why isn&rsquo;t anyone at least
saying hello?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Leane could answer&mdash;if she meant to&mdash;Siuan said, &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t stop pulling oar with the shore in
reach. Bring him on in.&rdquo; She disappeared inside while Min and Leane
were still guiding Logain to the door. He went easily, but when
they ceased to urge him he took only one step before stopping.</p>

<p>The common room looked like none Min had ever seen
before. The wide fireplaces were cold, of course, and had gaps
where stones had fallen out; the plaster ceiling looked rotten,
with holes in it as big as her head where the lathing showed.
Mismatched tables of every size and shape stood about on an
age-roughened floor that several girls were sweeping. Women with
ageless faces sat examining parchments, giving orders to Warders, a
few of whom wore their color-shifting cloaks, or to other women,
some of whom had to be Accepted or novices. Others were too old for
that, perhaps half of them graying and clearly showing their years,
and there were men who were not Warders, too, most either darting
off as though carrying messages or else fetching parchments or cups
of wine to the Aes Sedai. The bustle had a satisfying air of
something being done. Auras and images danced around the room,
wreathing heads, so many that she had to try to ignore them before
they overwhelmed her. It was not easy, but it was a trick she had
had to learn when around more than a handful of Aes Sedai at
once.</p>

<p>Four Aes Sedai glided forward to meet the newcomers,
all grace and cool serenity in their divided skirts. For Min,
seeing their familiar features was like reaching home after being
lost.</p>

<p>Sheriam&rsquo;s tilted green eyes fixed immediately on
Min&rsquo;s face. Rays of silver and blue flashed about her fiery hair,
and a soft golden light; Min could not say what it meant. Slightly
plump in her dark blue silk, at the moment she was sternness
itself. &ldquo;I would be happier to see you, child, if I knew how you
discovered our presence here, and if I had some inkling of why you
conceived the crack-brained idea of bringing him.&rdquo; Half a dozen
Warders had drifted near, hands resting on swords, eyes sharp on
Logain; he did not seem to see them at all.</p>

<p>Min gaped. Why were they asking <em>her</em>?
&ldquo;<em>My</em> crackbr&mdash;?&rdquo; She had no chance to say more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be far better,&rdquo; pale-cheeked Carlinya cut
in icily, &ldquo;if he had died as the rumors say.&rdquo; It was not the ice of
anger, but of cold reason. She was White Ajah. Her ivory-colored
dress looked as if it had had hard wear. For an instant Min saw an
image of a raven floating beside her dark hair; more a drawing of
the bird than the bird itself. She thought it was a tattoo, but she
did not know its meaning. She concentrated on faces, tried not to
see anything else. &ldquo;He looks nearly dead in any event,&rdquo; Carlinya
continued, hardly taking breath. &ldquo;Whatever you thought, you have
wasted your effort. But I, too, would like to know how you came to
Salidar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan and Leane stood there exchanging smugly amused
glances, while the onslaught went on. No one even <em>looked</em>
at them.</p>

<p>Myrelle, darkly beautiful in green silk embroidered
on the bodice with slanting lines of gold, her face a perfect oval,
usually wore a knowing smile that at times could rival Leane&rsquo;s new
tricks. She was not smiling now as she jumped in right behind the
White sister. &ldquo;Speak up, Min. Don&rsquo;t stand there gaping like a
dolt.&rdquo; She was noted for her fiery temper, even among the
Greens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must tell us,&rdquo; Anaiya added in a more kindly
voice. Exasperation tinged it, though. A blunt-featured woman, and
motherly despite Aes Sedai smoothness to her face, at the moment
stroking her pale gray skirts, she looked like a mother who was
trying not to reach for a switch. &ldquo;We will find a place for you and
these other two girls, but you must tell us how you came here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min shook herself, and closed her mouth. Of course.
These other two girls. She had grown so used to them as they were
that she no longer thought of how much they had changed. She
doubted whether any of these women had seen either since they were
hauled off to the dungeons beneath the White Tower. Leane looked
ready to laugh, and Siuan all but shook her head in disgust at the
Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not the one you want to talk to,&rdquo; Min told
Sheriam. <em>Let &ldquo;these other two girls&rdquo; have those stares on them
for a change</em>. &ldquo;Ask Siuan, or Leane.&rdquo; They stared at her as if
she were mad, until she nodded to her two companions.</p>

<p>Four sets of Aes Sedai eyes shifted to the others,
but there was no instant recognition. They studied and frowned and
passed glances between them. None of the Warders took their eyes
from Logain or their hands from their swords.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stilling might produce this effect,&rdquo; Myrelle
murmured finally. &ldquo;I have read accounts that imply as much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The faces are close, in many ways,&rdquo; Sheriam said
slowly. &ldquo;Someone could have found women who look much like them,
but why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan and Leane did not look smug any longer. &ldquo;We are
who we are,&rdquo; Leane said crisply. &ldquo;Question us. No impostor could
know what we know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan did not wait for questions. &ldquo;My face may be
changed, yet at least I know what I am doing and why. That is more
than I can say for you, I&rsquo;ll wager.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min groaned at her steely tone, but Myrelle nodded,
saying, &ldquo;That is Siuan Sanche&rsquo;s voice. It is she.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Voices can be trained,&rdquo; Carlinya said, still coolly
calm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how far can memories be taught?&rdquo; Anaiya frowned
sternly. &ldquo;Siuan&mdash;if that is who you are&mdash;on your
twenty-second nameday we had an argument, you and I. Where did it
occur, and what was the outcome?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan smiled confidently at the motherly woman.
&ldquo;During your lecture to the Accepted on why so many of the nations
carved out of Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s empire after his death failed to
survive. I still disagree with you on some points, by the way. The
outcome was that I spent two months working three hours a day in
the kitchens. &lsquo;In the hope that the heat will overpower and
diminish your ardor,&rsquo; I think you said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If she had thought that one answer would be
sufficient, she was wrong. Anaiya had more questions, for both
women, and so did Carlinya and Sheriam, who apparently had been
novices and Accepted with the pair. They were all about the sort of
thing no impostor would be able to learn, scrapes gotten into,
pranks successful and not, opinions generally held of various Aes
Sedai teachers. Min could not believe that the women who would
become the Amyrlin Seat and the Keeper of the Chronicles could have
dropped themselves into the soup so often, but she had the
impression that this was only the tip of a buried mountain, and it
appeared that Sheriam herself might not have been far behind them.
Myrelle, the youngest by years, confined herself to amused
comments, until Siuan said something about a trout put into Saroiya
Sedai&rsquo;s bath and a novice taught to mind her ways for half a year.
Not that Siuan had much room to talk of anyone minding her ways.
Washing a disliked Accepted&rsquo;s shifts with itchweed when she was a
novice? Sneaking out of the Tower to go fishing? Even Accepted
needed permission to leave the Tower grounds except during certain
hours. Siuan and Leane together had even chilled a bucket of water
to near freezing and set it so it would douse an Aes Sedai who had
had them switched, unfairly as they saw it. From the glint in
Anaiya&rsquo;s eyes, it was a good thing for them that they had not been
found out that time. From what Min knew of novice training, and
Accepted for that matter, these women were lucky that they had been
allowed to remain long enough to become Aes Sedai, much less that
they still had whole hides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am satisfied,&rdquo; the motherly woman said at last,
glancing at the others.</p>

<p>Myrelle nodded after Sheriam did, but Carlinya said,
&ldquo;There is still the question of what to do with her.&rdquo; She stared
right at Siuan, unblinking, and the others suddenly seemed uneasy.
Myrelle pursed her lips, and Anaiya studied the floor. Smoothing
her dress, Sheriam seemed to avoid looking at the newcomers at
all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We still know everything we knew before,&rdquo; Leane told
them, her sudden frown at least half-worry. &ldquo;We can be of use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan was dark-faced&mdash;Leane had seemed amused
if anything at her recounted girlhood misdeeds and penalties, but
Siuan had not liked the telling one bit&mdash;yet in contrast to
her near-glare, her voice was only a little tight. &ldquo;You wanted to
know how we found you. I made contact with one of my agents who
also works for the Blue, and she told me of Sallie Daera.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min did not understand that about Sallie Daera at all&mdash;who was she?&mdash;but Sheriam and the others nodded at one
another. Siuan had done something other than tell them how, Min
realized; she had let them know that she still had access to the
eyes-and-ears who had served her as Amyrlin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sit over there, Min,&rdquo; Sheriam told Min, pointing
to the one table not in use, in a corner. &ldquo;Or are you still
Elmindreda? And keep Logain with you.&rdquo; She and the other three
gathered Siuan and Leane, herding them toward the back of the
common room. Two more women in riding dresses joined them before
they vanished through a new-made door of uncured boards.</p>

<p>Sighing, Min took Logain&rsquo;s arm and led him to the
table, sat him down on a rough bench and took a shaky ladder-back
chair herself. Two of the Warders positioned themselves nearby,
leaning against the wall. They did not appear to be watching
Logain, but Min knew the Gaidin; they saw everything, and they
could have their swords out in less than a heartbeat while
sleeping.</p>

<p>So there were to be no open arms in welcome, even
with Siuan and Leane recognized. Well, what did she expect? Siuan
and Leane had been the two most powerful women in the White Tower;
now they were not even Aes Sedai. The others very likely did not
know how to behave toward them. And appearing with a gentled false
Dragon. Siuan had better not be lying or wishing about having a
plan for him. Min did not think Sheriam and the others would be as
patient as Logain had been.</p>

<p>And Sheriam, at least, had recognized her. She stood
again, long enough to peer through a crack-paned window into the
street. Their horses were still at the hitching posts, but one of
those Warders who were not watching would have her before she had
Wildrose&rsquo;s reins untied. This last time in the Tower, Siuan had
gone to great lengths to disguise her. To no end, it seemed. She
did not think any of them knew about her viewings, though. Siuan
and Leane had held that tightly to themselves. Min would be just as
glad if it remained that way. If these Aes Sedai learned of it,
they would entangle her just as Siuan had, and she would never
reach Rand. She was not going to be able to show off what she had
learned from Leane if they kept her on a leash here.</p>

<p>Helping Siuan find this gathering, helping bring Aes
Sedai to Rand&rsquo;s Aiel, was all very well and important, but she
still had a personal goal. Making a man who had never looked at her
twice fall in love with her before he went mad. Maybe she was as
mad as he was fated to be. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll make a matched pair,&rdquo; she
muttered to herself.</p>

<p>A freckled, green-eyed girl who had to be a novice
stopped at her table. &ldquo;Would you like something to eat or drink?
There is venison stew, and wild pears. There might be some cheese,
too.&rdquo; She put so much effort into not looking at Logain that she
might as well have stared pop-eyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pears and cheese sound very good,&rdquo; Min told her. The
last two days had been hungry; Siuan had managed to catch some fish
in a stream, but Logain had done all the hunting when they had not
eaten at an inn or a farm. Dried beans did not make a meal, in her
opinion. &ldquo;And some wine, if you have it. But first, I would like
some information. Where are we, if it isn&rsquo;t a secret here too? This
village is called Salidar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Altara. The Eldar is about a mile to the west.
Amadicia is on the other side.&rdquo; The girl put on a poor imitation of
Aes Sedai mystery. &ldquo;Where better to hide Aes Sedai than where they
would never be looked for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should not have to hide,&rdquo; a dark, curly-haired
young woman snapped, stopping. Min recognized her, an Accepted
named Faolain; she would have expected her to be in the Tower
still. Faolain had never liked anyone or anything as far as Min
knew, and had often spoken of choosing the Red Ajah when she was
raised. A perfect follower for Elaida. &ldquo;Why did you come here? With
<em>him</em>! Why did <em>she</em> come?&rdquo; There was no doubt in
Min&rsquo;s mind who she meant. &ldquo;It is her fault we have to hide. I did
not believe she helped Mazrim Taim escape, but if she appears here
with <em>him</em>, maybe she did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be enough, Faolain,&rdquo; a slender woman with
black hair spilling down her back to her waist told the round-faced
Accepted. Min thought she knew the woman in the dark golden
silk riding dress. Edesina. A Yellow, she believed. &ldquo;Go about your
duties,&rdquo; Edesina said. &ldquo;And if you mean to bring food, Tabiya, do
it.&rdquo; Edesina did not watch Faolain&rsquo;s sullen curtsy&mdash;the
novice gave a better and scurried away&mdash;but put a hand on
Logain&rsquo;s head instead. Eyes on the table, he did not seem to
notice.</p>

<p>To Min&rsquo;s eyes, a silvery collar suddenly appeared,
snug around the woman&rsquo;s neck, and as suddenly seemed to shatter.
Min shivered. She did not like viewings connected to the Seanchan.
At least Edesina would escape somehow. Even if Min had been willing
to expose herself, there was no point in warning the woman; it
would not change anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the gentling,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai said after a
moment. &ldquo;He has given up on wanting to live, I suppose. There is
nothing I can do for him. Not that I am sure I should if I could.&rdquo;
The look she gave Min before leaving was far from friendly.</p>

<p>An elegant, statuesque woman in russet silk paused a
few feet away, coolly examining Min and Logain with expressionless
eyes. Kiruna was a Green, and regal in her manner; she was a sister
of the King of Arafel, so Min had heard, but she had been friendly
to Min in the Tower. Min smiled, but those large dark eyes swept
over her without recognition, and Kiruna glided out of the inn,
four Warders, disparate men but all with that deadly-seeming way of
moving, suddenly heeling her.</p>

<p>Waiting for her food, Min hoped that Siuan and Leane
were finding a warmer reception.</p>
