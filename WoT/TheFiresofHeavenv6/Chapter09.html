<h4><em>A Signal</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ynaeve
had to admit that Thom and Juilin between
them had chosen a good campsite, in a sparse thicket growing on an
eastern slope, covered with dead leaves, a scant mile from
Mardecin. Scattered sourgums and some sort of small,
droopy-branched willow screened the wagon from the road and the
town, and a two-foot-wide rivulet ran from a stone outcrop near the
top of the rise, down a bed of dried mud twice as broad. Enough
water for their purposes. It was even a little cooler under the
trees, with a small and welcome breeze.</p>

<p>Once the two men had watered the team and hobbled
them where the horses could feed on the sparse grass upslope, they
tossed a coin to decide which should take the lanky gelding into
Mardecin to purchase what they needed. The coin flipping was a
ritual that they had developed. Thom, whose nimble fingers were
used to performing sleight-of-hand, never lost when he flipped the
coin, so Juilin always did it now.</p>

<p>Thom won anyway, and while he was stripping the
saddle from Skulker, Nynaeve put her head under the wagon seat and
levered up a floorboard with her belt knife. Besides two small
gilded coffers containing Amathera&rsquo;s presents of jewelry, several
leather purses bulging with coin lay in the recess. The panarch had
been more than generous in her desire to see their backs. The other
things looked trifling by comparison; a small dark wooden box,
polished but plain and uncarved, and a washleather purse lying flat
and showing the impression of a disc inside. The box held the two
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> they had recovered from the Black Ajah, both
linked to dreams, and the purse&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;That was their prize from
Tanchico. One of the seals on the Dark One&rsquo;s prison.</p>

<p>As much as she wanted to find out where Siuan Sanche
wanted them to chase the Black Ajah next, the seal was the source
of her haste to reach Tar Valon. Digging coins from one of the fat
purses, she avoided touching the flat purse; the longer it remained
in her possession, the more she wanted to hand it to the Amyrlin
and be done with it. Sometimes she thought she could feel the Dark
One, trying to break through, when she was near the thing.</p>

<p>She saw Thom off with a pocketful of silver and a
strong admonition to search out some fruit and green vegetables;
either man was likely as not to buy nothing but meat and beans,
left to himself. Thom&rsquo;s limp as he led the horse off toward the
road made her grimace; an old injury, and nothing to be done for it
now, so Moiraine said. That rankled as much as the limp itself.
Nothing to be done.</p>

<p>When she had left the Two Rivers, it had been to
protect young people from her village, snatched away in the night
by an Aes Sedai. She had gone to the Tower still with the hope that
she could somehow shelter them, and the added ambition of bringing
down Moiraine for what she had done. The world had changed since
then. Or maybe she only saw the world differently. <em>No, it is
not me that&rsquo;s changed. I&rsquo;m the same; it is everything else that&rsquo;s
different</em>.</p>

<p>Now it was all she could do to protect herself. Rand
was what he was, and no turning back, and Egwene eagerly went her
own way, not letting anyone or anything hold her back even if her
way led over a cliff, and Mat had learned to think of nothing but
women, carousing and gambling. She even found herself sympathizing
with Moiraine sometimes, to her disgust. At least Perrin had gone
back home, or so she had heard through Egwene, secondhand from
Rand; perhaps Perrin was safe.</p>

<p>Hunting the Black Ajah was good and right and
satisfying&mdash;and also terrifying, though she tried to hide
that part; she was a grown woman, not a girl who needed to hide in
her mother&rsquo;s apron&mdash;yet that was not the main reason she was
willing to keep on bashing her head against a wall, keep on trying
to learn to use the Power when most of the time she could not
channel any more than Thom. That reason was the Talent called
Healing. As Wisdom of Emond&rsquo;s Field it had been gratifying to bring
the Women&rsquo;s Circle around to her way of thinking&mdash;especially
since most were old enough to be her mother; with not many years on
Elayne, she had been the youngest Wisdom ever in the Two Rivers&mdash;and even more so to see that the Village Council did what
they should, stubborn men that they were. The most satisfaction,
though, had always come from finding the right combination of herbs
to cure an illness. To Heal with the One Power&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She had done
it, fumbling, curing what her other skills never could. The joy of
it was enough to bring tears. One day she meant to Heal Thom and
watch him dance. One day she would even Heal that wound in Rand&rsquo;s
side. Surely there was nothing that could not be Healed, not if the
woman wielding the Power was determined enough.</p>

<p>When she turned from watching Thom go, she found that
Elayne had filled the bucket that normally hung beneath the wagon
and was kneeling to wash her hands and face, a towel around her
shoulders to keep her dress dry. That was something she
particularly wanted to do herself. In this heat it was pleasant
sometimes to wash in water cool from a stream. Often enough there
had been no water but what was in the barrels strapped to the
wagon, and that was needed for drinking and cooking more than
washing.</p>

<p>Juilin was sitting with his back against one of the
wagon wheels, his thumb-thick staff of pale ridged wood leaning
next to him. His head was down, that silly hat tipped precariously
over his eyes, but she was not willing to bet on even a man
sleeping at this time of the morning. There were things he and Thom
did not know, things it was best they did not know.</p>

<p>The thick carpet of dead sourgum leaves crackled as
she seated herself near Elayne. &ldquo;Do you think Tanchico really has
fallen?&rdquo; Rubbing a soapy cloth slowly across her face, the other
woman did not reply. She tried again. &ldquo;I think that Whitecloak&rsquo;s
Aes Sedai were us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s voice was cool, a pronouncement
from the throne. Her eyes were blue ice. She did not look at
Nynaeve. &ldquo;And perhaps reports of what we did got tangled with other
rumors. Tarabon could have a new king, and a new panarch, very
easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve kept her temper in check and her hands away
from her braid. They clutched her knees instead. <em>You are trying
to put her at ease with you. Watch your tongue</em>. &ldquo;Amathera was
difficult, but I do not wish her any harm. Do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pretty woman,&rdquo; Juilin said, &ldquo;especially in one of
those Taraboner serving girl&rsquo;s dresses, with a pretty smile. I
thought she&mdash;&rdquo; He saw Elayne and her looking at him
and quickly pulled his hat back down, pretending to sleep again.
She and Elayne shared a glance, and she knew the other&rsquo;s thought
was the same as hers. <em>Men</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever has happened to Amathera, Nynaeve, she is
behind us, now.&rdquo; Elayne sounded more normal. Her washcloth slowed.
&ldquo;I wish her well, but mainly I hope the Black Ajah is not behind
us. Not following, I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juilin stirred uneasily without raising his head; he
was still uncomfortable with the knowledge that Black Aes Sedai
were real and not simply a tale in the streets.</p>

<p><em>He should be happy he doesn&rsquo;t have our
knowledge</em>. Nynaeve had to admit that the thought was not
entirely logical, but if he had known about the Forsaken being
loose, even Rand&rsquo;s foolish instruction to look after her and Elayne
would not have kept him from running. Still, he was useful at
times. He and Thom both. It had been Moiraine who had fastened Thom
to them, and the man knew a great deal about the world for an
ordinary gleeman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they were following, they&rsquo;d have caught up by
now.&rdquo; That was surely true, considering the usual lumbering speed
of the wagon. &ldquo;With any luck, they still do not know who we
are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne nodded, grim but her old self again, and began
rinsing her face. She could be almost as determined as a Two Rivers
woman. &ldquo;Liandrin and most of her cronies surely escaped from
Tanchico. Maybe all of them. And we still don&rsquo;t know who is giving
orders for the Black Ajah in the Tower. As Rand would say, we still
have it to do, Nynaeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite herself, Nynaeve winced. True, they had a
list of eleven names, but once they were back in the Tower, almost
any Aes Sedai they spoke to might be Black Ajah. Or any women they
encountered on the road. For that matter, anyone they met <em>
might</em> be a Darkfriend, but that was hardly the same thing, not
by a wide degree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than the Black Ajah,&rdquo; Elayne continued, &ldquo;I
worry about Mo&mdash;&rdquo; Nynaeve put a quick hand on her arm and
nodded slightly toward Juilin. Elayne coughed and went on as though
that was what had stopped her. &ldquo;About mother. She has no reason to
like you, Nynaeve. Quite the opposite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is far away from here.&rdquo; Nynaeve was glad her
voice was steady. They were not talking about Elayne&rsquo;s mother, but
the Forsaken she had defeated. Part of her hoped fervently that
Moghedien was far away. Very far.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if she was not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is,&rdquo; Nynaeve said firmly, but she still hitched
her shoulders uncomfortably. A part of her remembered humiliations
suffered at Moghedien&rsquo;s hands and desired nothing more than to face
the woman again, to defeat her again, for good this time. Only,
what if Moghedien took her by surprise, came at her when she was
not angry enough to channel? The same was true of any of the
Forsaken, of course, or of any Black sister for that matter, but
after her rout in Tanchico, Moghedien had reason to hate her
personally. Not pleasant at all to think that one of the Forsaken
knew your name and likely wanted your head. <em>That is just rank
cowardice</em>, she told herself sharply. <em>You are not a coward, and you
will not be!</em> That did not stop the itch between her shoulder
blades every time Moghedien came to mind, as if the woman was
staring at her back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose looking over my shoulder for bandits has
made me nervous,&rdquo; Elayne said casually, patting her face with the
towel. &ldquo;Why, sometimes when I dream of late, I have the feeling
that someone is watching me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave a start at what seemed an echo of her
own thoughts, but then she realized there had been a slight
emphasis on &ldquo;dream.&rdquo; Not any dreams, but <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.
Another thing the men did not know about. She had had the same
sensation, but then there was often a feel of unseen eyes in the
World of Dreams. It could be uncomfortable, but they had discussed
the sensation before.</p>

<p>She made her voice light. &ldquo;Well, your mother is not
in our dreams, Elayne, or she would probably snatch us both up by
an ear.&rdquo; Moghedien would probably torture them until they begged
for death. Or arrange a circle of thirteen Black sisters and
thirteen Myrddraal; they could turn you to the Shadow against your
will that way, bind you to the Dark One. Maybe Moghedien could even
do it by herself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous, woman! If she could
have, she would have. You beat her, remember?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;I do hope not,&rdquo; the other woman replied soberly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to give me a chance to wash?&rdquo; Nynaeve
asked irritably. Putting the girl at ease was all very well, but
she could do with less talk of Moghedien. The Forsaken had to be
somewhere distant; she would not have let them come this far
peacefully if she knew where they were. <em>Light send that that&rsquo;s
true!</em></p>

<p>Elayne emptied and refilled the bucket herself. She
was a very nice girl usually, when she remembered that she was not
in the Royal Palace in Caemlyn. And when she was not acting the
fool. That, Nynaeve would take care of when Thom came back.</p>

<p>Once Nynaeve had enjoyed a slow, cooling wash of face
and hands, she set about making the camp ready, and put Juilin to
breaking dead branches from the trees for a fire. By the time Thom
returned with two wicker hampers slung across the gelding&rsquo;s back,
her and Elayne&rsquo;s blankets were laid out under the wagon and the two
men&rsquo;s under the hanging branches of one of the twenty-foot willows,
a good supply of firewood had been stacked, the teakettle stood
cooling beside the ashes of a fire in a circle cleared of leaves,
and the thick pottery cups had been washed. Juilin was grumbling to
himself as he caught water in the tiny stream to refill the water
barrels. From the snatches Nynaeve heard, she was glad he kept most
of it to an inaudible mutter. From her perch on one of the wagon
shafts, Elayne hardly tried to hide her interested attempt to make
out what he was saying. Both she and Nynaeve had put on clean
dresses on the other side of the wagon, switching colors as it
happened.</p>

<p>After fastening hobbles between the gelding&rsquo;s
forelegs, Thom lifted the heavy hampers down easily and began
unpacking them. &ldquo;Mardecin&rsquo;s not as prosperous as it looks from a
distance.&rdquo; He set a net bag of small apples on the ground, and
another of some dark green leafy vegetable. &ldquo;With no trade into
Tarabon, the town is withering.&rdquo; The rest seemed to be all sacks of
dried beans and turnips, plus pepper-cured beef and salt-cured
hams. And a gray pottery bottle sealed with wax that Nynaeve was
sure held brandy; both men had complained of not having a bit of
something with their pipes of an evening. &ldquo;You can hardly take six
steps without seeing a Whitecloak or two. The garrison is about
fifty men or so, with barracks over the hill from the town on the
far side of the bridge. It was considerably larger, but it seems
Pedron Niall is pulling Whitecloaks from everywhere into Amador.&rdquo;
Knuckling his long mustaches, he looked thoughtful for a moment. &ldquo;I
cannot see what he is up to.&rdquo; Thom was not a man who liked that;
usually a few hours in a place was enough for him to begin
ferreting out the currents between noble and merchant Houses, the
alliances and schemes and counter-plots that made up the so-called
Game of Houses. &ldquo;The rumors are all about Niall trying to stop a
war between Illian and Altara, or maybe Illian and Murandy. No
reason there for him to be gathering in soldiers. I&rsquo;ll tell you one
thing, though. Whatever that lieutenant said, it is a King&rsquo;s Tax
that buys the food being sent into Tarabon, and the people are not
happy with it. Not to feed Taraboners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;King Ailron and the Lord Captain Commander are not
our concern,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, studying what he had brought. <em>
Three</em> salted hams! &ldquo;We will pass through Amadicia as quickly
and unobtrusively as we can. Perhaps Elayne and I will have more
luck finding vegetables than you did. Would you care for a walk,
Elayne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne got up immediately, smoothing her gray skirts
and lifting her hat from the wagon. &ldquo;That would be very nice, after
that wagon seat. It might be different if Thom and Juilin let me
take a turn riding Skulker more often.&rdquo; For once she did not give
the old gleeman a coquettish look, which was something.</p>

<p>Thom and Juilin exchanged glances, and the Tairen
thief-catcher pulled a coin from his coat pocket, but Nynaeve gave
him no chance to flip it. &ldquo;We will be quite all right by ourselves.
We could hardly expect trouble of any sort with so many Whitecloaks
to keep order.&rdquo; Planting her hat on her head, she tied the scarf
under her chin and gave them a firm look. &ldquo;Besides, all those
things Thom bought need to be put away.&rdquo; Both men nodded; slowly,
reluctantly, but they did it. Sometimes they took their roles as
supposed protectors entirely too seriously.</p>

<p>She and Elayne had reached the empty road and were
walking down the verge, on the thin grass so as not to kick up
dust, before she had it settled in her mind how to bring up what
she wanted to say. Before she could speak, though, Elayne said,
&ldquo;You obviously want to talk to me alone, Nynaeve. Is it about
Moghedien?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve blinked, and looked at the other woman
sideways. It was well to remember that Elayne was no fool. She had
only been acting like one. Nynaeve resolved to keep a tight hold on
her temper; this was going to be difficult enough without letting
it dissolve into a shouting match. &ldquo;Not that, Elayne.&rdquo; The girl
thought they should add Moghedien to their hunt; she could not seem
to realize the difference between one of the Forsaken and, say,
Liandrin, or Chesmal. &ldquo;I thought we should discuss how you&rsquo;ve been
behaving toward Thom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know what you mean,&rdquo; Elayne said, staring
straight ahead toward the town, but sudden spots of color in her
cheeks gave her the lie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not only is he old enough to be your father twice
over, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is <em>not</em> my father!&rdquo; Elayne snapped. &ldquo;My
father was Taringail Damodred, a Prince of Cairhien and First
Prince of the Sword of Andor!&rdquo; Straightening her hat needlessly,
she went on in a milder tone, though not by much. &ldquo;I am sorry,
Nynaeve. I did not mean to shout.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Temper</em>, Nynaeve reminded herself. &ldquo;I thought
you were in love with Rand,&rdquo; she said, making her voice gentle. It
was not easy. &ldquo;The messages you have me give to Egwene for him
certainly say so. I expect you tell her the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The color in the other woman&rsquo;s face heightened. &ldquo;I do
love him, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He is very far away, Nynaeve. In the Waste,
surrounded by a thousand Maidens of the Spear who jump to do his
bidding. I cannot see him, or speak to him, or touch him.&rdquo; She was
whispering by the end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll turn to a Maiden,&rdquo; Nynaeve
said incredulously. &ldquo;He is a man, but he isn&rsquo;t as fickle as that,
and besides, one of them would put a spear in him if he looked at
her crossways, even if he is this Dawn whatever. Anyway, Egwene
says Aviendha is keeping an eye on him for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I should have made <em>sure</em>
that he knew I love him.&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s voice was determined. And
worried. &ldquo;I should have told him so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve had hardly looked at a man before Lan, at
least not seriously, but she had seen and learned much as Wisdom;
from her observations, there was no quicker way to send a man
running for his life, unless he said it first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Min had a viewing,&rdquo; Elayne went on. &ldquo;About
me, and about Rand. She always used to joke about having to share
him, but I think it wasn&rsquo;t a joke and she could not bring herself
to say what it really was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is ridiculous.&rdquo; It certainly was. Though in
Tear, Aviendha had told her of a vile Aiel custom&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>You
share Lan with Moiraine</em>, a small voice whispered. <em>That
isn&rsquo;t the same thing at all!</em> she told it briskly. &ldquo;Are you
certain Min had one of her visions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I wasn&rsquo;t at first, but the more I think on it,
the more sure I become. She joked about it too often to mean
anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, whatever Min had seen, Rand was no Aiel. Oh,
his blood might be Aiel as the Wise Ones claimed, but he had grown
up in the Two Rivers, and she would not stand by and let him take
up wicked Aiel ways. She doubted very much that Elayne would,
either. &ldquo;Is that why you&rsquo;ve been&mdash;&rdquo; She would not say <em>
throwing yourself at</em> &ldquo;&mdash;teasing Thom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne gave her a sidelong glance, the crimson back
in her cheeks. &ldquo;There are a thousand leagues between us, Nynaeve.
Do you think Rand is refraining from looking at other women? &lsquo;A man
is a man, on a throne or in a pigsty.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; She had a stock of homely
sayings from her childhood nurse, a clearheaded woman named Lini
whom Nynaeve wished she would meet one day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see why you have to flirt just because
you think Rand might.&rdquo; She refrained from bringing up Thom&rsquo;s age
again. <em>Lan is old enough so be</em> your <em>father</em>, that
small voice murmured. <em>I</em> love <em>Lan. If I can only reason
out how to get him free of Moiraine</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>That is not the
matter at hand!</em> &ldquo;Thom is a man with secrets, Elayne. Remember
that Moiraine sent him with us. Whatever he is, he is no simple
country gleeman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a great man,&rdquo; Elayne said softly. &ldquo;He could
have been greater, except for love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that, Nynaeve&rsquo;s temper snapped. She rounded on
the other woman, seizing her by the shoulders. &ldquo;The man doesn&rsquo;t
know whether to turn you over his knee or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;climb a
tree!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Elayne gave a frustrated sigh. &ldquo;But I do
not know what else to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve ground her teeth in the effort not to shake
her until her skull rattled. &ldquo;If your mother heard of this, she&rsquo;d
send Lini to haul you back to the nursery!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a child any longer, Nynaeve.&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s
voice was strained, and now the flush in her cheeks was not
embarrassment. &ldquo;I am as much a woman as my mother is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve stalked on toward Mardecin, gripping her
braid so hard that her knuckles hurt.</p>

<p>After a few strides, Elayne caught up. &ldquo;Are we really
going to buy vegetables?&rdquo; Her face was composed, her tone
light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see what Thom brought back?&rdquo; Nynaeve said
tightly.</p>

<p>Elayne shuddered elaborately. &ldquo;Three hams. And that
awful peppered beef! Do men ever eat anything but meat if it isn&rsquo;t
set before them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s temper faded as they walked on talking
about the foibles of the weaker sex&mdash;men, of course&mdash;and such simple matters as that. Not completely away, of course.
She liked Elayne, and enjoyed her company; at times it seemed as if
the girl really was Egwene&rsquo;s sister, as they sometimes called each
other. When Elayne was not acting the twitch-skirt. Thom could put
a stop to it, of course, but the old fool indulged Elayne like a
fond father with his favorite daughter, even when he did not know
whether to say boo or faint. One way or another, she meant to get
to the bottom of it. Not for Rand&rsquo;s sake, but because Elayne was
better than this. It was as if she had contracted a strange fever.
Nynaeve intended to cure it.</p>

<p>Granite slabs paved the streets of Mardecin, worn by
generations of feet and wagon wheels, and the buildings were all
brick or stone. A number of them were empty though, both shops and
houses, sometimes with the front door standing open so Nynaeve
could see the bare interior. She saw three blacksmith&rsquo;s shops, two
abandoned, and in the third the smith was halfheartedly rubbing his
tools with oil and the forges were cold. One slate-roofed inn, with
men sitting morosely on benches out front, had a number of broken
windows, and at another the adjoining stable had its doors half-off
the hinges and a dusty coach squatting in the stableyard, one
forlorn hen nesting on the driver&rsquo;s high seat. Somebody in that one
was playing the bittern; &ldquo;Heron on the Wing,&rdquo; it sounded like, but
the tune was dispirited. The door of a third inn was barred by two
splintery planks nailed across it.</p>

<p>People thronged the streets, but they moved
lethargically, weighted down by the heat; dull faces said they had
no real reason to stir at all, beyond habit. Many women, in large
deep bonnets that almost hid their faces, had on dresses worn at
the hem, and more than one man had a frayed collar or cuffs on his
knee-length coat.</p>

<p>There were indeed Whitecloaks scattered through the
streets; if not so many as Thom had made out, still enough.
Nynaeve&rsquo;s breath caught every time she saw a man in a pristine
cloak and shining armor look at her. She knew she had not worked
with the Power nearly long enough to take on Aes Sedai agelessness,
but those men might well try to kill her&mdash;a Tar Valon witch,
and outlawed in Amadicia&mdash;if they even suspected a connection
to the White Tower. They strode through the crowds, seemingly
oblivious of the apparent poverty around them. People moved out of
their way respectfully, receiving perhaps a nod, if that, and often
a sternly pious &ldquo;Walk in the Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ignoring the Children of the Light as best she could,
she set herself to finding fresh vegetables, but by the time the
sun reached its peak, a blazing ball of gold that burned through
the thin clouds, she and Elayne had wandered both sides of the low
bridge and between them had managed to garner one small bunch of
honeypeas, some tiny radishes, a few hard pears, and a basket to
carry them in. Perhaps Thom really had looked. This time of year,
the barrows and stalls should have been full of the summer&rsquo;s
produce, but most of what they saw was heaped potatoes and turnips
that had known better days. Thinking of all those empty farms
approaching the town, Nynaeve wondered how these people were going
to make it through the winter. She walked on.</p>

<p>Hanging upside down beside the door of a
thatch-roofed seamstress&rsquo; shop was a bunch of what looked almost
like broomweed, with tiny yellow flowers, the stalks wrapped their
whole length in a white ribbon, then tied with a dangling yellow
one. It might have been some woman&rsquo;s feeble attempt at a festive
decoration in the midst of hard times. But she was sure it was
not.</p>

<p>Stopping beside an empty shop with a carving knife
incised on the sign still hanging over the door, she pretended to
search for a stone in her shoe while furtively studying the
seamstress&rsquo; shop. The door was open, and colorful bolts of cloth
stood in the small-paned windows, but no one went in or out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you not find it, Nynaeve? Take off your
shoe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s head jerked; she had almost forgotten that
Elayne was there. No one else was paying any attention to them, and
no one looked close enough to overhear. She still lowered her
voice. &ldquo;That bunch of broomweed by that shop door. It is a Yellow
Ajah signal, an emergency signal from one of the Yellow&rsquo;s
eyes-and-ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not have to tell Elayne not to stare; the
girl&rsquo;s eyes barely moved toward the shop. &ldquo;Are you certain?&rdquo; she
asked quietly. &ldquo;And how do you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I am certain. It&rsquo;s exact; the hanging bit
of yellow ribbon is even split in three.&rdquo; She paused to take a deep
breath. Unless she was completely mistaken, that insignificant
fistful of weeds held a dire meaning. If she was wrong, she was
making a fool of herself, and she did hate to do that. &ldquo;I spent a
good deal of time talking with Yellows in the Tower.&rdquo; Healing was
the main purpose of the Yellows; they did not care much for her
herbs, but you did not need herbs when you could Heal with the
Power. &ldquo;One of them told me. She did not think it too great a
transgression, since she was sure I&rsquo;ll choose Yellow. Besides, it
has not been used in nearly three hundred years. Elayne, only a few
women in each Ajah actually know who the Ajah&rsquo;s eyes-and-ears are,
but a bunch of yellow flowers tied and hung like that tells any
Yellow sister that here one is, and with a message urgent enough to
risk uncovering herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are we going to find out what it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve liked that. Not &ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo;
The girl had backbone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow my lead,&rdquo; she said, gripping the basket
tighter as she straightened. She hoped she remembered everything
Shemerin had told her. She hoped Shemerin had told her everything.
The plump Yellow could be fluttery for an Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>The interior of the shop was not large, and every
scrap of wall was taken up by shelves holding bolts of silk or
finely woven wool, spools of piping and binding, and ribbon and
lace of every width and description. Dressmaker&rsquo;s dummies stood
about the floor wearing garments ranging from half-made to
complete, from something suitable for a dance in embroidered green
wool to a pearly gray silk gown that could have done very well at
court. At first glance the shop had a look of prosperity and
activity, but Nynaeve&rsquo;s sharp eye caught a hint of dust in one high
neck of frothy Solinde lace, and on a large black velvet bow at the
waist of another gown.</p>

<p>There were two dark-haired women in the shop. One,
young and thin and trying to wipe her nose surreptitiously with the
back of her hand, held a bolt of pale red silk clutched anxiously
to her bosom. Her hair was a mass of long curls to her shoulders,
in the Amadician fashion, but it seemed a tangle beside the other
woman&rsquo;s neat array. The other, handsome and in her middle years,
was assuredly the seamstress, as proclaimed by the large bristling
pincushion fastened to her wrist. Her dress was of a good green
wool, well cut and well made to show her skill, but only lightly
worked with white flowers around the high neck so as not to
overshadow her patrons.</p>

<p>When Nynaeve and Elayne walked in, both women gaped
as if none had entered in a year. The seamstress recovered first,
regarding them with careful dignity as she made a slight curtsy.
&ldquo;May I serve you? I am Ronde Macura. My shop is yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want a dress embroidered with yellow roses on the
bodice,&rdquo; Nynaeve told her. &ldquo;But no thorns, mind,&rdquo; she added with a
laugh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t heal very fast.&rdquo; What she said did not matter, so
long as she included &ldquo;yellow&rdquo; and &ldquo;heal&rdquo; in it. Now, if only that
bunch of flowers was not happenstance. If that was the case, she
would have to find some reason not to buy a dress with roses. And a
way to keep Elayne from recounting the whole miserable experience
to Thom and Juilin.</p>

<p>Mistress Macura stared at her for a moment with dark
eyes, then turned to the thin girl, pushing her toward the back of
the shop. &ldquo;Go on to the kitchen, Luci, and make a pot of tea for
these good ladies. From the blue canister. The water&rsquo;s hot, thank
the Light. Go on, girl. Put that down and stop gawking. Quickly,
quickly. The blue canister, mind. My best tea,&rdquo; she said, turning
back to Nynaeve as the girl vanished through a door at the rear. &ldquo;I
live over the shop, you see, and my kitchen is in the back.&rdquo; She
was smoothing her skirts nervously, thumb and forefinger of her
right hand forming a circle. For the Great Serpent ring. There
would be no need for an excuse about the dress, it seemed.</p>

<p>Nynaeve repeated the sign, and after a moment Elayne
did, too. &ldquo;I am Nynaeve, and this is Elayne. We saw your
signal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman fluttered as if she might fly away. &ldquo;The
signal? Ah. Yes. Of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;What is the urgent
message?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should not talk about that out here&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Mistress Nynaeve. Anyone might walk in.&rdquo; Nynaeve doubted that. &ldquo;I
will tell you over a nice cup of tea. My best tea, did I say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve exchanged looks with Elayne. If Mistress
Macura was this reluctant to speak her news, it must be appalling
indeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we may just step into the back,&rdquo; Elayne said, &ldquo;no
one will hear but us.&rdquo; Her regal tone made the seamstress stare.
For a moment, Nynaeve thought it might cut through her nervousness,
but the next instant the fool woman was babbling again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tea will be ready in a moment. The water&rsquo;s
already hot. We used to get Taraboner tea through here. That is why
I am here, I suppose. Not the tea, of course. All the trade that
used to be, and all the news that came both ways with the wagons.
They&mdash;you are mainly interested in outbreaks of disease, or a
new kind of illness, but I find that interesting myself. I dabble a
little with&mdash;&rdquo; She coughed and rushed on; if she
smoothed her dress any harder, she would wear a hole in it. &ldquo;Some
about the Children, of course, but they&mdash;you&mdash;are not
much interested in them, really.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The kitchen, Mistress Macura,&rdquo; Nynaeve said firmly
as soon as the other woman paused for breath. If the woman&rsquo;s news
made her this afraid, Nynaeve would brook no more delay in hearing
it.</p>

<p>The door at the back opened enough to admit Luci&rsquo;s
anxious head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ready, Mistress,&rdquo; she announced
breathlessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way, Mistress Nynaeve,&rdquo; the seamstress said,
still rubbing the front of her dress. &ldquo;Mistress Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A short hallway led past narrow stairs to a snug,
beam-ceilinged kitchen, with a steaming kettle sitting on the
hearth and tall cupboards everywhere. Copper pots hung between the
back door and a window that looked out into a small yard with a
high wooden fence. The small table in the middle of the floor held
a brilliant yellow teapot, a green honey jar, three mismatched cups
in as many colors, and a squat blue pottery canister with the lid
beside it. Mistress Macura snatched the canister, lidded it, and
hastily put it into a cupboard that held more in two dozen shades
and hues.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit, please,&rdquo; she said, filling the cups.
&ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve took a ladder-back chair next to Elayne, and
the seamstress set cups in front of them, flitting to one of the
cupboards for pewter spoons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The message?&rdquo; Nynaeve said as the woman sat down
across from them. Mistress Macura was too nervous to touch her own
teacup, so Nynaeve stirred a little honey into hers and took a sip;
it was hot, but had a cool, minty aftertaste. Hot tea might settle
the woman&rsquo;s nerves, if she could be made to drink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pleasant taste,&rdquo; Elayne murmured over the edge of
her cup. &ldquo;What sort of tea is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Good girl</em>, Nynaeve thought.</p>

<p>But the seamstress&rsquo; hands only fluttered beside her
cup. &ldquo;A Taraboner tea. From near the Shadow Coast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sighing, Nynaeve took another swallow to settle her
own stomach. &ldquo;The message,&rdquo; she said insistently. &ldquo;You did not hang
that signal to invite us for tea. What is your urgent news?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah. Yes.&rdquo; Mistress Macura licked her lips, eyed them
both, then said slowly, &ldquo;It came near a month ago, with orders that
any sister passing through heard it at all costs.&rdquo; She wet her lips
again. &ldquo;All sisters are welcome to return to the White Tower. The
Tower must be whole and strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve waited for the rest, but the other woman fell
silent. <em>This</em> was the dire message? She looked at Elayne,
but the heat seemed to be catching up to the girl; drooping in her
chair, she was staring at her hands on the table. &ldquo;Is that all of
it?&rdquo; Nynaeve demanded, and surprised herself by yawning. The heat
must be reaching her, too.</p>

<p>The seamstress only watched her, intently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said,&rdquo; Nynaeve began, but suddenly her head felt
too heavy for her neck. Elayne had slumped onto the table, she
realized, eyes closed and arms hanging limply. Nynaeve stared at
the cup in her hands with horror. &ldquo;What did you give us?&rdquo; she said
thickly; that minty taste was still there, but her tongue felt
swollen. &ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo; Letting the cup fall, she levered herself up
against the table, knees wobbling. &ldquo;The Light burn you, what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mistress Macura scraped back her chair and stepped
out of reach, but her earlier nervousness was now a look of quiet
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Blackness rolled in on Nynaeve; the last thing she
heard was the seamstress&rsquo; voice. &ldquo;Catch her, Luci!&rdquo;</p>
