<h4><em>Twilight</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ith
his <em>Far Dareis Mai</em> escort, Rand
approached the Rhuidean Roof of the Maidens. White stairs as wide
as the tall building, each step a stride deep, ran up to thick
columns twenty paces high, black-seeming in the twilight but bright
blue by day, and fluted in spirals. The outside of the building was
a patterned mosaic of glazed tiles, white and blue in spirals that
appeared endless to the eye, and a huge window of colored glass
directly above the columns showed a black-haired woman fifteen feet
tall, in complicated blue robes, right hand upraised, either to
bless or command a halt. Her face was serene and stern at the same
time. Whoever she had been, she was surely no Aiel, not with that
pale skin and those dark eyes. An Aes Sedai, perhaps. He tapped his
pipe out on his bootheel and stuffed it into his coat pocket before
starting up the steps.</p>

<p>Except for <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, men were not allowed
beneath a Roof of the Maidens, not any man, not in any hold in the
Waste. A chief or a Maiden&rsquo;s blood kin could die trying, though in
fact no Aielman would ever think of it. It was the same for any
society; only members and the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> were allowed
inside.</p>

<p>The two Maidens standing guard at the tall bronze
doors flashed Maiden handtalk at one another, cutting their eyes in
his direction as he came through the columns, then shared a small
grin. He wished he knew what they had said. Even in as dry a land
as the Waste, bronze would tarnish with enough time, but <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em> had polished these doors until they looked new-made.
They stood wide open, and the pair of guards made no move to hinder
him as he walked through, Adelin and the others on his heels.</p>

<p>The wide, white-tiled corridors and great rooms
inside were full of Maidens, sitting about on bright cushions,
talking, tending to weapons, playing cat&rsquo;s cradle, or stones, or
Thousand Flowers, an Aiel game that involved laying out patterns of
flat bits of stone carved with what seemed a hundred different
symbols. Of course, a profusion of <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> moved
smoothly about their chores, cleaning, serving, mending, seeing to
oil lamps that ranged from simple glazed pottery to gilded loot
from somewhere to the tall stand-lamps that had been found in the
city. In most rooms, colorful carpets, and bright tapestries
covered the floors and walls, in nearly as many patterns and styles
as there <em>were</em> carpets and tapestries. The walls and
ceilings themselves were detailed mosaics, of forests and rivers
and skies that had never been seem in the Waste.</p>

<p>Young or old, the Maidens smiled when they saw him,
and some nodded familiarly or even patted his shoulder. Others
called out, asking how he was, had he eaten, would he like the <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em> to bring him wine or water? He responded briefly
though with answering smiles. He was well, and neither hungry nor
thirsty. He kept walking, not even slowing when he spoke. Slowing
would lead inevitably to stopping, and he was not up to that
tonight.</p>

<p><em>Far Dareis Mai</em> had adopted him, after a
fashion. Some treated him as a son, others as a brother. Age seemed
not to come into it; women with white in their hair might talk to
him as a brother over tea, while Maidens no more than a year older
than he tried to make sure he wore the proper clothes for the heat.
There was no avoiding the mothering; they simply did it, and he
could not see how to make them stop, short of using the Power
against the whole lot of them.</p>

<p>He had thought of trying to have another society
provide his guards&mdash;<em>Shae&rsquo;en M&rsquo;taal</em>, the Stone Dogs,
perhaps, or <em>Aethan Dor</em>, the Red Shields; Rhuarc had been a
Red Shield before becoming chief&mdash;only, what reason could he
possibly give? Not the truth, certainly. Just thinking about
explaining that to Rhuarc and the others made him uncomfortable;
Aiel humor being what it was, even sour old Han would likely break
his ribs laughing. Any reason at all would probably offend the
honor of every last Maiden. At least they rarely mothered him
except under the Roof, where there was no one to see but
themselves, and <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> who knew better than to speak of
anything that happened there. &ldquo;The Maidens,&rdquo; he had once said,
&ldquo;carry my honor.&rdquo; Everyone remembered that, and the Maidens were as
proud of it as if he had given them all thrones. But it had turned
out that they carried it in a manner they chose.</p>

<p>Adelin and the other four left him to join their
friends, but he was hardly alone as he climbed higher in the
building, along curving flights of wide white stairs. He had to
answer the same questions at practically every step. No, he was not
hungry. Yes, he knew he was not used to the heat yet, and no, he
had not spent too much time in the sun. He bore it all patiently,
but he did heave a sigh of relief when he reached the second story
above the huge window. Here there were no Maidens and no <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em> in the broad hallways or on the stairs that led on
upward. The bare walls and empty chambers emphasized the absence of
people, but after traversing the floors below, he found solitude a
blessing.</p>

<p>His bedroom was a windowless chamber near the center
of the building, one of the few that was not huge, though its
ceiling still reached high enough to make height the room&rsquo;s longest
dimension. What it had been meant for originally, he had no idea; a
mosaic of vines around the small fireplace was the only
ornamentation. A servant&rsquo;s room, he would have said, but servants&rsquo;
rooms did not have a door sheathed in bronze, however plain, that
he pushed most of the way shut. <em>Gai&rsquo;shain</em> had polished the
metal to a dull gleam. A few tasseled cushions lay scattered on the
blue floor tiles for sitting, and a thick pallet, atop bright
layered rugs, for sleeping. A simple blue-glazed pitcher of water
and. a dark green cup sat on the floor near the &ldquo;bed.&rdquo; That was it,
except for two three-pronged stand-lamps, already lit, and a
pace-high pile of books in one corner. With a tired sigh, he lay
down on the pallet still in his coat and boots; no matter how he
shifted it was not much softer than sleeping on the bare floor.</p>

<p>The night&rsquo;s chill was already seeping into the room,
but he did not bother to light the dried cow dung on the hearth; he
was readier to face the cold than the smell. Asmodean had tried to
show him a simple way to keep the room warm; simple, but something
the man did not have enough strength to do himself. The one time
Rand had tried it, he had awakened in the middle of the night,
gasping for breath while the edges of the rugs smoldered from the
heat of the floor. He had not made another attempt.</p>

<p>He had chosen this building for his quarters because
it was whole and near to the plaza; its great high ceilings gave a
semblance of coolness even to the hottest part of the day, and its
thick walls kept out the worst of the cold at night. It had not
been the Roof of the Maidens then, of course. One morning he simply
awakened to find it so, Maidens in every room on the first two
floors and their guards on the doors. It had taken him a while to
realize that they intended the building for their society&rsquo;s Roof in
Rhuidean, yet expected him to continue to stay in it. In fact, they
were ready to move the Roof wherever he went. That was why he had
to meet the clan chiefs elsewhere. The best he had been able to
manage was to make the Maidens agree to stay below the floor where
he slept; that had amused them all no end. <em>Even the</em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn <em>is not a king</em>, he reminded himself wryly. Twice
already he had moved upward as the numbers of Maidens increased.
Idly he tried to calculate how many more could come in before he
was sleeping on the roof.</p>

<p>That was better than remembering how he had let
Moiraine get under his skin. He had not meant her to learn his
plans until the day the Aiel moved. She knew exactly how to
manipulate his emotions, how to make him so angry that he said more
than he wanted to. <em>I never used to get so angry. Why is it so
hard to hold on to my temper?</em> Well, there was nothing she
could do to stop him. He did not think there was. He had to
remember to be careful around her. His increasing abilities
occasionally made him careless toward her, but if he was far
stronger, she still knew more than he, even with Asmodean&rsquo;s
teaching.</p>

<p>In a way, letting Asmodean know his plans was less
important than revealing his intentions to the Aes Sedai. <em>To
Moiraine I&rsquo;m still just a shepherd she can use for the Tower&rsquo;s
ends, but to Asmodean I&rsquo;m the only branch he can hold on to in a
flood</em>. Strange to think he could probably trust one of the
Forsaken more than he could Moiraine. Not that he could trust
either very far. Asmodean. If his bonds to the Dark One had
shielded him from the taint on <em>saidin</em>, there had to be
another way to do it. Or to cleanse it.</p>

<p>The trouble was that before they went over to the
Shadow, the Forsaken had been among the most powerful Aes Sedai in
the Age of Legends, when things the White Tower never dreamed of
were commonplace. If Asmodean did not know a way, it probably did
not exist. <em>It has to. There has to be something. I&rsquo;m not going
to just sit until I go mad and die</em>.</p>

<p>That was plain foolish. Prophecy had made a
rendezvous for him at Shayol Ghul. When, he did not know; but
afterward, he would not have to worry about going mad any longer.
He shivered and thought about unfolding his blankets.</p>

<p>The faint sound of soft-soled footsteps in the hall
snapped him upright. <em>I told them! If they can&rsquo;t</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>!</em> The woman who pushed open the door, her arms full of
thick wool blankets, was not anyone he expected.</p>

<p>Aviendha paused just inside the room to regard him
with cool, blue-green eyes. A more than pretty woman, of an age
with him, she had been a Maiden until she gave up the spear to
become a Wise One, not very long ago. Her dark reddish hair still
came well short of her shoulders and hardly needed the folded brown
scarf to keep it out of her face. She seemed a bit awkward with her
brown shawl, a bit impatient with her full gray skirts.</p>

<p>He felt a stab of jealousy at the silver necklace she
wore, an elaborate string of intricately worked discs, each
different. <em>Who gave her that?</em> She would not have chosen it
herself; she did not seem to like jewelry. The only other piece she
wore was a wide ivory bracelet, carved in finely detailed roses. He
had given her that, and he was not sure she had forgiven him for it
yet. It was foolish of him to be jealous in any case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you in ten days,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought
the Wise Ones would have tied you to my arm once they found out I&rsquo;d
blocked them out of my dreams.&rdquo; Asmodean had been amused at the
first thing he wanted to learn, and then frustrated at how long
Rand took to learn it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have my training to do, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo; She would
be one of the few Wise Ones who could channel; that was part of
what she was being taught. &ldquo;I am not one of your wetlander women,
to stand about so you can look at me whenever you wish.&rdquo; Despite
knowing Egwene, and Elayne for that matter, she had an oddly
wrongheaded view of what she called wetlander women, and of
wetlanders in general. &ldquo;They are not pleased at what you have
done.&rdquo; She meant Amys, Bair and Melaine, the three Wise One
dreamwalkers who were teaching her, and trying to watch him.
Aviendha shook her head ruefully. &ldquo;They were especially not pleased
that I had let you know they were walking your dreams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stared at her. &ldquo;You told them? But you didn&rsquo;t
really say anything. I figured it out myself, and I would have
eventually even if you hadn&rsquo;t let a hint slip out. Aviendha, they
<em>told</em> me they could speak to people in their dreams. It was
only a step from that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you have had me dishonor myself further?&rdquo; Her
voice was level enough, but her eyes could have started the fire
laid on the hearth. &ldquo;I will not dishonor myself for you or any man!
I gave you the trail to follow, and I will not deny my shame. I
should have let you freeze.&rdquo; She threw the blankets right on top of
his head.</p>

<p>He pulled them off and laid them beside him on the
pallet while trying to think of what to say. It was <em>
ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em> again. The woman was as prickly as a thornbush.
Supposedly she had been given the task of teaching him Aiel
customs, but he knew her true job, to spy on him for the Wise Ones.
Whatever dishonor was attached to spying among Aiel, apparently it
did not extend to the Wise Ones. They knew he knew, but for some
reason it did not seem to concern them, and as long as they were
willing to let matters remain as they were, so was he. For one
thing, Aviendha was not a very good spy; she almost never tried to
find anything out, and her own temper got in the way of making him
angry or guilty the way Moiraine did. For another, she was actually
pleasant company sometimes, when she forgot to keep her thorns out.
At least he knew who it was that Amys and the others had set to
watch him; if it was not she, it would be someone else, and he
would be constantly wondering who. Besides, she was never wary
around him.</p>

<p>Mat, Egwene, even Moiraine sometimes looked at him
with eyes that saw the Dragon Reborn, or at least the danger of a
man who could channel. The clan chiefs and the Wise Ones saw He Who
Comes With the Dawn, the man prophesied to break the Aiel like
dried twigs; if they did not fear him, they still sometimes treated
him like a red adder they had to live with. Whatever Aviendha saw,
it never stopped her being scathing whenever she chose, which was
most of the time.</p>

<p>An odd sort of comfort, but compared to the rest, it
was a comfort nonetheless. He had missed her. He had even picked
flowers from some of the spiny plants around Rhuidean&mdash;bloodying his fingers until he realized he could use the Power&mdash;and sent them to her, half a dozen times; the Maidens had
carried the blossoms themselves, instead of sending <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em>. She had never acknowledged them, of course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said finally, touching the blankets.
They seemed a safe enough subject. &ldquo;I suppose you can&rsquo;t have too
many in the nights here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enaila asked me to bring them to you when she found
out I was here to see you.&rdquo; Her lips twitched in the beginnings of
an amused smile. &ldquo;A number of the spear-sisters were worried that
you might not be warm enough. I am to see that you light your fire
tonight; you didn&rsquo;t last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand felt his cheeks coloring. She knew. <em>Well,
she would, wouldn&rsquo;t she? The bloody Maidens may not tell her
everything anymore, but they don&rsquo;t bother to keep anything from
her, either</em>. &ldquo;Why did you want to see me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To his surprise, she folded her arms beneath her
breasts and paced the short length of the room twice before
stopping to glare at him. &ldquo;This was not a regard gift,&rdquo; she said
accusingly, shaking the bracelet at him. &ldquo;You admitted as much.&rdquo;
True, though he thought she might have put a knife in his ribs had
he not conceded it. &ldquo;It was simply a fool gift from a man who did
not know or care what my&mdash;what the spear-sisters might think. Well,
this has no meaning either.&rdquo; She pulled something from her pouch
and tossed it onto the pallet beside him. &ldquo;It cancels debt between
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand picked up what she had thrown and turned it over
in his hands. A belt buckle in the shape of a dragon, ornately made
in good steel and inlaid with gold. &ldquo;Thank you. It&rsquo;s beautiful.
Aviendha, there is no debt to cancel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will not take it against my debt,&rdquo; she said
firmly, &ldquo;then throw it away. I will find something else to repay
you. It is only a trinket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly a trinket. You must have had this made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not think that means anything, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. When
I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;gave up the spear, my spears, my knife&rdquo;&mdash;unconsciously her hand brushed her belt, where that long-bladed
knife used to hang&mdash;&ldquo;even the points of my arrows were taken
from me and handed to a smith to make simple things to give away.
Most I gave to friends, but the Wise Ones had me name the three men
and three women I most hate, and I was told to give each of them a
gift made from my weapons, with my own hands. Bair says it teaches
humility.&rdquo; Straight-backed and glaring, biting off each word, she
looked and sounded anything but humble. &ldquo;So you will not think that
means anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means nothing,&rdquo; he said, nodding sadly. Not that
he wanted it to mean anything, really, but it would have been
pleasing to think she might be beginning to see him as a friend. It
was plain foolish to feel jealousy over her. <em>I wonder who gave
it to her?</em> &ldquo;Aviendha? Was I one of those you hate so
much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo; She suddenly sounded hoarse. For
a moment she turned her face away, eyes shut and quivering. &ldquo;I hate
you with all of my heart. I do. And I always will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not bother to ask why. Once he had asked her
why she disliked him and practically had his nose snapped, off. She
had not told him, though. But this was more than a dislike she
sometimes seemed to forget. &ldquo;If you really hate me,&rdquo; he said
reluctantly, &ldquo;I will ask the Wise Ones to send someone else to
teach me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; If anything, her denial was even more fierce
this time. She planted her fists on her hips and lectured as if she
meant to drive every word home in his heart. &ldquo;Even if the Wise Ones
allowed me to stop, I have <em>toh</em>, obligation and duty, to my
near-sister Elayne, to watch you for her. You belong to her, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor. To her and no other woman. Remember that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He felt like throwing up his hands. At least this
time she was not describing to him how Elayne looked without any
clothes; some Aiel customs took even more getting used to than
others. He sometimes wondered if she and Elayne had agreed on this
&ldquo;watching&rdquo; between them. He could not believe it, but then again,
even women who were not Aiel were odd as often as not. More than
that, he wondered who Aviendha was supposed to be protecting him
from. Except for the Maidens and the Wise Ones, Aiel women seemed
to look at him half as prophecy made flesh, and thus not really
flesh at all, and half as a blood snake loose among children. The
Wise Ones were nearly as bad as Moiraine when it came to trying to
make him do what they wanted, and the Maidens he did not want to
think about. The whole thing made him furious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you listen to me. I kissed Elayne a few times,
and I think she enjoyed it as much as I did, but I am not promised
to anyone. I&rsquo;m not even sure she wants that much from me anymore.&rdquo;
In the space of a few hours she had written him two letters; one
called him the dearest light of her heart before going on to make
his ears burn, while the other named him a coldhearted wretch she
never wanted to see again and then proceeded to rip him up one side
and down the other, better than Aviendha ever had. Women were
definitely odd. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time to think about women anyway. The
only thing on my mind is uniting the Aiel, even the Shaido if I
can. I&mdash;&rdquo; He cut off with a groan as the very last woman he
could have hoped for swayed into the room in a clatter of jewelry,
carrying a silver tray with a blown-glass flagon of wine and two
silver cups.</p>

<p>A diaphanous red silk scarf wrapped around Isendre&rsquo;s
head did nothing to hide her palely beautiful, heart shaped face.
Her long dark hair and dark eyes never belonged to any Aiel. Her
full, pouting lips were curved enticingly&mdash;until she saw Aviendha.
Then the smile faded to a sickly thing. Aside from the scarf she
had on a dozen or more necklaces of gold and ivory, some set with
pearls or polished gems. As many bracelets weighted each wrist, and
even more bunched around her ankles. That was it; she wore not
another thing. He made himself keep his eyes strictly on her face,
but even so his cheeks felt hot.</p>

<p>Aviendha looked like a thunderhead about to spit
lightning, Isendre like a woman who had just learned she was to be
boiled alive. Rand wished he were in the Pit of Doom, or anywhere
but there. Still, he got to his feet; he would have more authority
looking down on them than the other way around. &ldquo;Aviendha,&rdquo; he
began, but she ignored him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did someone send you with that?&rdquo; she asked
coldly.</p>

<p>Isendre opened her mouth, the intended lie plain on
her face, then gulped and whispered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been warned about this, <em>sorda</em>.&rdquo; A
<em>sorda</em> was a kind of rat, especially sly according to the
Aiel, and good for absolutely nothing; its flesh was so rank that
even cats seldom ate the ones they killed. &ldquo;Adelin thought the last
time would have taught you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Isendre flinched, and swayed as if about to
faint.</p>

<p>Rand gathered himself. &ldquo;Aviendha, whether she was
sent or not doesn&rsquo;t matter. I am a little thirsty, and if she was
kind enough to bring me wine, she should be thanked for it.&rdquo;
Aviendha glanced coolly at the two cups and raised her eyebrows. He
took a deep breath. &ldquo;She should not be punished just for bringing
me something to drink.&rdquo; He was careful not to look at the tray
himself. &ldquo;Half the Maidens under the Roof must have asked if I <em>&mdash;&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;She was taken by the Maidens for theft from Maidens,
Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo; Aviendha&rsquo;s voice was even colder than it had been
for the other woman. &ldquo;You have meddled too much already in the
business of <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>, more than you should have been
allowed. Not even the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> can thwart justice; this
is no concern of yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He grimaced&mdash;and let it go. Whatever the
Maidens did to her, Isendre certainly had coming. Just not for
this. She had entered the Waste with Hadnan Kadere, but Kadere had
not cracked his teeth when the Maidens took her for stealing the
jewelry that was now all they let her wear. It had been all Rand
could do to keep her from being sent off to Shara tethered like a
goat, or else dispatched naked toward the Dragonwall with one water
bag; watching her plead for mercy once she realized what the
Maidens intended, he had not been able to make himself stay out of
it. Once he had killed a woman; a woman who meant to kill him, but
the memory still burned. He did not think he would ever be able to
do it again, even with his life in the balance. A foolish thing,
with female Forsaken likely seeking his blood or worse, but there
it was. And if he could not kill a woman, how could he stand by and
let a woman die? Even if she deserved it?</p>

<p>That was the rub. In any land west of the Dragonwall,
Isendre would face the gallows or the headsman&rsquo;s block for what he
knew about her. About her, and Kadere, and probably most of the
merchant&rsquo;s men if not all. They were Darkfriends. And he could not
expose them. Not even they were aware that he knew.</p>

<p>If any one of them was revealed as a Darkfriend&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Isendre endured as best she could, because even being a servant and
kept naked was better than being tied hand and foot and left for
the sun, but none would keep silent once Moiraine had her hands on
them. Aes Sedai had no more mercy for Darkfriends than for anyone
else; she would loosen their tongues in short order. And Asmodean
had come into the Waste with the merchant&rsquo;s wagons, too, just
another Darkfriend so far as Kadere and the others knew, though one
with authority. No doubt they thought he had taken service with the
Dragon Reborn on orders from some still higher power. To keep his
teacher, to keep Moiraine from trying to kill both of them very
probably, Rand had to keep their secret.</p>

<p>Luckily, no one questioned why the Aiel kept such a
close watch on the merchant and his men. Moiraine thought it was
the usual Aiel suspicion of outsiders in the Waste, magnified by
them being in Rhuidean; she had had to use all of her persuasion to
make the Aiel let Kadere and his wagons into the city. The
suspicion was there; Rhuarc and the other chiefs likely would have
set guards even if Rand had not asked. And Kadere just seemed happy
he did not have a spear through his ribs.</p>

<p>Rand had no idea how he was going to resolve the
situation. Or if he could. It was a fine mess. In gleemen&rsquo;s
stories, only villains got caught in a cleft stick like this.</p>

<p>Once she was sure that he was not going to try to
interfere further, Aviendha turned her attention back to the other
woman. &ldquo;You may leave the wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Isendre half-knelt gracefully to set the tray beside
his pallet, a peculiar grimace on her face. It took Rand a moment
to recognize an attempt to smile at him without letting the Aiel
woman see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now you will run to the first Maiden you can
find,&rdquo; Aviendha went on, &ldquo;and tell her what you have done. Run,
<em>sorda</em>!&rdquo; Moaning and wringing her hands, Isendre ran in a
great rattle of jewelry. As soon as she was out of the room,
Aviendha rounded on him. &ldquo;You belong to Elayne! You have no right
to try luring any woman, but especially not that one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her?&rdquo; Rand gasped. &ldquo;You think I&mdash;? Believe me,
Aviendha, if she were the last woman on earth, I&rsquo;d still stay as
far from her as I could run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you say.&rdquo; She sniffed. &ldquo;She has been switched
seven times&mdash;seven!&mdash;for trying to sneak to your bed. She would not
persist like that without some encouragement. She faces <em>Far
Dareis Mai</em> justice, and she is no concern of even the <em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>. Take that as your lesson for today on our customs.
And remember that you belong to my near-sister!&rdquo; Without letting
him get a word in, she stalked out wearing such a look that he
thought Isendre might not survive if Aviendha caught up to her.</p>

<p>Letting out a long breath, he got up long enough to
put the tray and its wine in a corner of the room. He was not about
to drink anything Isendre brought him.</p>

<p><em>Seven times she&rsquo;s tried to reach me?</em> She
must have learned that he interceded for her; no doubt to her way
of thinking, if he was willing to do that for a smoky look and a
smile, what might he do for more? He shivered at the thought as
much as the increasing cold. He would rather have a scorpion in his
bed. If the Maidens failed to convince her, he might tell her what
he knew about her; that should put an end to any schemes.</p>

<p>Snuffing the lamps, he crawled onto his pallet in the
dark, still booted and fully dressed, and fumbled around until he
had pulled all of the blankets over him. Without the fire, he
suspected he really would be grateful to Aviendha before morning.
Setting the wards of Spirit that shielded his dreams from intrusion
was almost automatic to him now, but even as he did it, he chuckled
to himself. He could have gotten into bed and <em>then</em> put out the
lamps, with the Power. It was the simple things that he never
thought of doing with the Power.</p>

<p>For a time he lay waiting for his body&rsquo;s heat to warm
the inside of the blankets. How the same place could be so hot by
day and so cold by night was beyond him. Sticking one hand under
his coat, he fingered the half-healed scar on his side. That wound,
the one that Moiraine could never completely Heal, was what would
kill him, eventually. He was sure of it. His blood on the rocks of
Shayol Ghul. That was what the Prophecies said.</p>

<p><em>Not tonight. I won&rsquo;t think of that tonight. I
have a little time yet. But if the seals can be shaved with a
knife, now, do they still hold as strongly</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>? No. Not
tonight.</em></p>

<p>The inside of the blankets was becoming a little
warmer, and he shifted around, trying and failing to find a
comfortable way to lie. <em>I should have washed</em>, he thought
drowsily. Egwene was probably in a warm sweat tent right that
minute. Half the time he used one, a fistful of Maidens tried to
come in with him&mdash;and nearly rolled on the ground laughing when he
insisted on them staying outside. It was bad enough having to
undress and dress in the steam.</p>

<p>Sleep finally came, and with it, safely protected
dreams, safe from the Wise Ones or anyone else. Not protected from
his own thoughts, though. Three women invaded them continually. Not
Isendre, except in a brief nightmare that nearly woke him. By turns
he dreamed of Elayne, and Min, and Aviendha, by turns and together.
Only Elayne had ever looked at him as a man, but all three saw him
as who he was, not what he was. Aside from the nightmare, they were
all pleasant dreams.</p>
