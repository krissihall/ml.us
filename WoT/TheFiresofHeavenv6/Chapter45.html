<h4><em>After the Storm</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">S</span>itting
on a small boulder jutting from the foot of
the slope, Mat winced as he pulled his broad-brimmed hat lower
against the midmorning sun. Partly to shield his eyes from the sun.
There was another thing he did not want to see, though cuts and
bruises reminded him, especially the arrow slash along his temple
that the hat pressed against. An ointment from Daerid&rsquo;s saddlebags
had stopped the bleeding, there and elsewhere, yet everything still
hurt, and most of it stung. That part would grow worse. The heat of
the day was just beginning to take hold, but sweat was beading up
on his face and already dampening his smallclothes and shirt. Idly
he wondered whether autumn would ever come to Cairhien. At least
discomfort kept him from thinking how tired he was; even after a
night with no sleep he would have lain awake in a feather bed, much
less blankets on the ground. Not that he wanted to be anywhere near
his tent in any case.</p>

<p><em>A fine bloody to-do. Nearly killed, I&rsquo;m sweating
like a pig, I can&rsquo;t find a comfortable place to stretch out, and I
don&rsquo;t dare get drunk. Blood and bloody ashes!</em> He stopped
fingering a slice across the chest of his coat&mdash;an inch
difference, and that spear would have gone through his heart;
Light, but the man had been good!&mdash;and put that part of it
out of his mind. Not that it was easy, with what was going on all
around him.</p>

<p>For once the Tairens and Cairhienin did not seem to
mind seeing Aiel tents in every direction. There were even Aiel
right in the camp, and almost as miraculously, Tairens mingling
with Cairhienin among the smoky cookfires. Not that anyone was
eating; the kettles had not been set on the fires, although he
could smell meat burning somewhere. Instead, most were as drunk as
they could manage on wine, brandy, or Aiel <em>oosquai</em>, laughing and
celebrating. Not far from where he sat, a dozen Defenders of the
Stone, stripped to sweaty shirtsleeves, were dancing to the claps
of ten times as many watchers. In a line, with arms around each
others&rsquo; shoulders, they stepped so quickly that it was a wonder
none of them tripped or kicked the man next to them. For another
circle of onlookers, near a ten-foot pole stuck in the ground&mdash;Mat hastily averted his eyes&mdash;as many Aielmen were
doing some kicking of their own. Mat assumed it was a dance;
another Aiel was playing the pipes for them. They leaped as high as
they could, flung one foot even higher, then landed on that foot
and immediately leaped upward again, faster and faster, sometimes
spinning like horizontal tops at the height of their leaps, or
turning somersaults or backflips. Seven or eight Tairens and
Cairhienin sat nursing broken bones from trying it, all the while
cheering and laughing like madmen, passing a stone crock of
something back and forth. In other places other men were dancing,
and maybe singing. It was hard to say, in the din. Without
stirring, he could count ten flutes, not to mention twice as many
tin whistles, and a skinny Cairhienin in a ragged coat was blowing
something that looked part flute and part horn with some odd bits
tossed in. And there were countless drums, most of them pots being
banged with spoons.</p>

<p>In short, the camp was bedlam and a ball rolled into
one. He recognized it, mainly from those memories he could still
assign to other men if he concentrated hard enough. A celebration
of still being alive. One more time they had walked under the Dark
One&rsquo;s nose and survived to tell the tale. One more dance along the
razor&rsquo;s edge finished. Almost dead yesterday, maybe dead tomorrow,
but alive, gloriously alive, today. He did not feel like
celebrating. What good was being alive if it meant living in a
cage?</p>

<p>He shook his head as Daerid, Estean and a heavyset
red-haired Aielman he did not know staggered by, holding each other
up. Barely audible through the clamor, Daerid and Estean were
trying to teach the taller man between them the words to &ldquo;Dance
with Jak o&rsquo; the Shadows.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sing all night, and drink all day,<br>
 and on the girls we&rsquo;ll spend our pay,<br>
 and when it&rsquo;s gone, then we&rsquo;ll away,<br>
 to dance with Jak o&rsquo; the Shadows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sun dark fellow showed no interest in learning,
of course&mdash;he would not unless they convinced him it was a
proper battle hymn&mdash;but he listened, and he was not the only
one. By the time the three passed out of sight in the milling
crowd, they had acquired a tail of twenty more, waving dented
pewter cups and tarred leather mugs, all bellowing the tune at the
top of their lungs.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;There&rsquo;re some delight in ale and wine,<br>
 and some in girls with ankles fine,<br>
 but my delight, yes, always mine,<br>
 is to dance with Jak o&rsquo; the Shadows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat wished he had never taught any of them the song.
The teaching had just kept his mind occupied while Daerid stopped
him from bleeding to death; that ointment stung as bad as the
gashes themselves had, and Daerid would never make a seamstress
jealous with his delicate handling of needle and thread. Only, the
song had spread from that first dozen like fire in dry grass.
Tairens and Cairhienin, horse and foot, had all been singing it
when they returned at dawn.</p>

<p>Returned. Right back to the hill valley where they
had started, below the ruin of the log tower, and no chance for him
to get away. He had offered to ride ahead, and Talmanes and
Nalesean nearly came to blows over who was to provide his escort.
Not everyone had become the best of friends. All he needed now was
for Moiraine to come asking questions about where he had been and
why, nattering at him about <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> and duty, about the
Pattern and Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don, until his head spun. Doubtless she was
with Rand now, but she would get around to him eventually.</p>

<p>He glanced up at the hilltop and the tangle of
shattered logs among broken trees. That Cairhienin fellow who had
made the looking glasses for Rand was up there with his
apprentices, poking about. The Aiel had been full of what happened
there. It was definitely past time for him to be gone. The foxhead
medallion protected him from women channeling, but he had heard
enough from Rand to know a man&rsquo;s channeling was different. He had
no interest in finding out whether the thing would shield him from
Sammael and his ilk.</p>

<p>Grimacing at darts of pain, he used the black-hafted
spear to lever himself to his feet. Around him the celebration went
on. If he drifted down to the picket lines now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He was not
looking forward to saddling Pips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hero should not sit without drinking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Startled, he jerked around, grunting at the stab of
his wounds, to stare at Melindhra. She had a large clay pitcher in
one hand, not spears, and her face was not veiled, but her eyes
seemed to be weighing him. &ldquo;Now listen, Melindhra, I can explain
everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What must be explained?&rdquo; she asked, flinging her
free arm around his shoulders. Even with the sudden jolt, he tried
to stand straighter, but still was not used to having to look up at
a woman. &ldquo;I knew you would seek your own honor. The <em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> casts a great shadow, but no man wishes to spend
his life in the shade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Closing his mouth hurriedly, he managed a faint, &ldquo;Of
course.&rdquo; She was not going to try to kill him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it exactly.&rdquo;
In his relief, he took the pitcher from her, but his gulp turned
into a splutter. It was the rawest double-distilled brandy he had
ever tasted.</p>

<p>She retrieved the pitcher long enough to take a draw,
then sighed gratefully and pushed it back at him. &ldquo;He was a man of
much honor, Mat Cauthon. Better that you had captured him, but even
by killing him, you have gained much <em>ji</em>. It was well that
you sought him out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite himself, Mat looked at what he had been
avoiding, and shivered. A leather cord tied in short flame-red hair
held Couladin&rsquo;s head atop the ten-foot pole near where the
Aielmen were dancing. The thing seemed to be grinning. At
him.</p>

<p>Sought Couladin out? He had done his best to keep the
pikes between him and <em>any</em> of the Shaido. But that arrow
had clipped the side of his head, and he was on the ground before
he knew it, struggling to get to his feet with the fight raging all
around him, laying about him with the raven-marked spear, trying to
make it back to Pips. Couladin had appeared as if springing out of
air, veiled for killing, but there had been no mistaking those bare
arms, entwined with Dragons glittering gold-and-red. The man had
been cutting a swath into the pikemen with his spears, shouting for
Rand to show himself, shouting that <em>he</em> was the true <em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>. Maybe he really believed it by then. Mat still did
not know whether Couladin had recognized him, but it had made no
difference, not when the fellow decided to carve a hole through him
to find Rand. He did not know who had cut off Couladin&rsquo;s head
afterward, either.</p>

<p><em>I was too busy trying to stay alive to
watch</em>, he thought sourly. And hoping he would not bleed to
death. Back in the Two Rivers he had been as fine a hand with a
quarterstaff as anyone, and a quarterstaff was not so different
from a spear, but Couladin must have been born with the things in
his hands. Of course, that skill had not availed the man much in
the end. <em>Maybe I still have a little bit of luck. Please,
Light, let it show itself now!</em></p>

<p>He was thinking of how to get rid of Melindhra so he
could saddle Pips when Talmanes presented himself with a formal
bow, hand to heart in the Cairhienin fashion. &ldquo;Grace favor you,
Mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; Mat said absently. She was not going to go
because he asked. Asking would certainly put a fox in the henyard.
Maybe if he told her he wanted to take a ride. They said Aiel could
run down horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A delegation came from the city during the night.
There will be a triumphal procession for the Lord Dragon, in
gratitude from Cairhien.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will there?&rdquo; She had to have duties of some sort.
The Maidens were always flocking around Rand; maybe she would be
called off for that. Glancing at her though, he did not think he
had better count on it. Her wide smile was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;proprietary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The delegation was from the High Lord Meilan,&rdquo;
Nalesean said, joining them. His bow was just as correct, both
hands sweeping wide, but hasty. &ldquo;It is he who offers the procession
to the Lord Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Dobraine, Lord Maringil and Lady Colavaere,
among others, also came to the Lord Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat pulled his mind back to the moment. Each of the
pair was trying to pretend the other of them did not exist&mdash;both looking right at him, with never the flicker of an eye toward
each other&mdash;but their faces were as tight as their voices
from the strain, their hands white knuckled on sword hilts. It
would be a cap to everything if they came to blows, and him likely
still trying to hobble out of reach when one of them ran him
through by accident. &ldquo;What does it matter who sent a delegation, as
long as Rand gets his procession?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It matters that you should ask him for our rightful
place at the head,&rdquo; Talmanes said quickly. &ldquo;You slew Couladin, and
earned us that place.&rdquo; Nalesean closed his mouth and scowled;
plainly he had been about to say the same thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You two ask him,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of my
affair.&rdquo; Melindhra&rsquo;s hand tightened on the back of his neck, but he
did not care. Moiraine would surely not be far from Rand. He was
not about to put his neck in a second noose while still trying to
think his way out of the first.</p>

<p>Talmanes and Nalesean gaped at him as if he were
demented. &ldquo;You are our battle leader,&rdquo; Nalesean protested. &ldquo;Our
general.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My body-servant will polish your boots,&rdquo; Talmanes
put in with a small smile that he carefully did not direct at the
square-faced Tairen, &ldquo;and brush and mend your clothes. So you will
appear at your best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nalesean gave his oiled beard a jerk; his eyes darted
halfway to the other man before he could stop them. &ldquo;If I may
offer, I have a good coat I think will fit you well. Gold satin and
crimson.&rdquo; It was the Cairhienin&rsquo;s turn to glower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;General!&rdquo; Mat exclaimed, holding himself up with the
spear haft. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no flaming&mdash;! I mean, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to
usurp your place.&rdquo; Let them figure out which one of them he
meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn my soul,&rdquo; Nalesean said, &ldquo;it was your battle
skill that won for us, and kept us alive. Not to mention your luck.
I&rsquo;ve heard how you always turn the right card, but it is more than
that. I&rsquo;d follow you if you had never met the Lord Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are our leader,&rdquo; Talmanes said right on top of
him, in a voice more sober if no less certain. &ldquo;Until yesterday I
have followed men of other lands because I must. You I will follow
because I want to. Perhaps you are not a lord in Andor, but here, I
say that you are, and I pledge myself your man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cairhienin and Tairen stared at one another as though
startled at voicing the same sentiment, then slowly, reluctantly,
exchanged brief nods. If they did not like each other&mdash;and
only a fool would bet against that&mdash;they could meet on this
point. After a fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will send my groom to prepare your horse for the
procession,&rdquo; Talmanes said, and barely frowned when Nalesean added,
&ldquo;Mine can share the work. Your mount must do us proud. And burn my
soul, we need a banner. Your banner.&rdquo; At that the Cairhienin nodded
emphatically.</p>

<p>Mat was not sure whether to laugh hysterically or sit
down and cry. Those bloody memories. If not for them, he would have
ridden on. If not for Rand, he would not have the things. He could
trace the steps that led to them, each necessary as it seemed at
the time and seeming an end in itself, yet each leading inevitably
to the next. At the beginning of it all lay Rand. And bloody
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>. He could not understand why doing something that seemed
absolutely necessary and as close to harmless as he could make it
always seemed to lead him deeper into the mire. Melindhra had begun
stroking the back of his neck instead of squeezing it. All he
needed now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He glanced up the hill, and there she was. Moiraine,
on her delicate-stepping white mare, with Lan on his black stallion
towering at her side. The Warder bent toward her as if to listen,
and there seemed to be a brief argument, a violent protest on his
part, but after a moment the Aes Sedai reined Aldieb around and
rode out of sight toward, the opposite slope. Lan remained where he
was on Mandarb, watching the camp below. Watching Mat.</p>

<p>He shivered. Couladin&rsquo;s head really did appear to be
grinning at him. He could almost hear the man speak. <em>You may
have killed me, but you&rsquo;ve put your foot squarely in the trap. I&rsquo;m
dead, but you&rsquo;ll never be free</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just bloody wonderful,&rdquo; he muttered, and took a
long, choking swallow of the rough brandy. Talmanes and Nalesean
seemed to think he meant it as said, and Melindhra laughed
agreement.</p>

<p>Some fifty or so Tairens and Cairhienin had gathered
to watch the two lords speak to him, and they took his drinking as
a signal to serenade him, beginning with a verse of their own.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;Well toss the dice however they fall,<br>
 and snuggle the girls be they short or tall,<br>
 then follow young Mat whenever he calls,<br>
 to dance with Jak o&rsquo; the Shadows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a wheezing laugh he could not stop, Mat sank
back down onto the boulder and set about emptying the pitcher.
There had to be some way out of this. There just had to be.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Rand&rsquo;s eyes opened slowly, staring up at the roof of
his tent. He was naked beneath a single blanket. The absence of
pain seemed almost startling, yet he felt even weaker than he
remembered. And he did remember. He had said things, thought things&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;His skin went cold. <em>I cannot let him take control. I am
me! Me!</em> Fumbling beneath the blanket, he found the smooth
round scar on his side, tender yet whole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine Sedai Healed you,&rdquo; Aviendha said, and he
gave a start.</p>

<p>He had not seen her, sitting cross-legged on the
layered rugs near the firepit, sipping from a silver cup worked
with leopards. Asmodean lay sprawled across tasseled cushions, chin
on his arms. Neither appeared to have slept; dark circles
underlined their eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She should not have had to,&rdquo; Aviendha went on in a
cool voice. Tired or not, she had every hair in place, and her neat
clothes were a sharp contrast to Asmodean&rsquo;s rumpled dark velvets.
Now and then she twisted the ivory bracelet of roses-and-thorns
that he had given her as if not realizing what she was doing. She
wore the silver snowflake necklace, too. She still had not told him
who had given it to her, though she had seemed amused when she
realized he really wanted to know. She certainly did not look
amused now. &ldquo;Moiraine Sedai herself was near collapse from Healing
wounded. <em>Aan&rsquo;allein</em> had to carry her to her tent. Because
of you, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Because Healing you took the last of her
strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Aes Sedai is on her feet already,&rdquo; Asmodean put
in, stifling a yawn. He ignored Aviendha&rsquo;s pointed stare. &ldquo;She has
been here twice since sunrise, though she said you would recover. I
think she was not so certain last night. Nor was I.&rdquo; Pulling his
gilded harp around in front of him, he fussed with it, speaking in
an idle tone. &ldquo;I did what I could for you, of course&mdash;my life
and fortune are tied to yours&mdash;but my talents lie elsewhere
than Healing, you understand.&rdquo; He strummed a few notes to
demonstrate. &ldquo;I understand that a man can kill or gentle himself
doing what you did. Strength in the Power is useless if the body is
exhausted. <em>Saidin</em> can easily kill, if the body is
exhausted. Or so I have heard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you finished sharing your wisdom, Jasin Natael?&rdquo;
Aviendha&rsquo;s tone was chillier, if anything, and she did not wait for
a reply before turning a gaze like blue-green ice back to Rand. The
interruption, it seemed, was his fault. &ldquo;A man may behave like a
fool sometimes, and little is the worse for it, but a chief must be
more than a man, and the chief of chiefs more still. You had no
right to push yourself near to death. Egwene and I tried to make
you come with us when we grew too tired to continue, but you would
not listen. You may be as much stronger than we as Egwene claims,
yet you are still flesh. You are the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, not a new
<em>Seia Doon</em> seeking honor. You have <em>toh</em>,
obligation, to the Aiel, Rand al&rsquo;Thor, and you cannot fulfill it
dead. You cannot do everything yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment he could only gape at her. He had barely
managed to do anything at all, had left the battle to others for
all practical purposes while he stumbled about trying to be useful.
He had not even been able to stop Sammael from striking where and
as he chose. And she upbraided him for doing too much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will try to remember,&rdquo; he said finally. Even so,
she looked ready to lecture more. &ldquo;What news of the Miagoma and the
other three clans?&rdquo; he asked, as much to divert her as because he
wanted to know. Women seldom seemed willing to stop until they had
hammered you into the ground, unless you managed to distract
them.</p>

<p>It worked. She was full of what she knew, of course,
and as eager to instruct as to scold. Asmodean&rsquo;s soft strumming&mdash;for once, something pleasant, even pastoral&mdash;made an
odd background for her words.</p>

<p>The Miagoma, the Shiande, the Daryne and the Codarra
were camped within sight of one another, a few miles to the
east. A steady stream of men and Maidens moved between the camps,
including Rand&rsquo;s, but only among societies, and Indirian and the
other chiefs were not stirring. There was no doubt now that they
would come to Rand eventually, but not until the Wise Ones finished
their talks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are still talking?&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;What under the
Light do they have to discuss that takes so long? The chiefs are
coming to follow me, not them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave him a flat look that would have done credit
to Moiraine. &ldquo;The Wise Ones&rsquo; words are for Wise Ones, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo; Hesitating, she added, as if making a concession, &ldquo;Egwene
may tell you something of it. When it is done.&rdquo; Her tone implied
that Egwene might not, too.</p>

<p>She resisted his attempts to learn more, and finally
he let it lie. Perhaps he would find out before it bit him, and
perhaps not, but either way, he was not going to pry one word out
of her that she did not want to speak. Aes Sedai had nothing on
Aiel Wise Ones when it came to guarding their secrets and
surrounding themselves with mystery. Aviendha was absorbing that
particular lesson very well.</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s presence at the meeting of Wise Ones came as
a surprise, and so did Moiraine&rsquo;s absence&mdash;he would have
expected her to be in the middle, twitching strings to her plans&mdash;but it turned out that one grew from the other. The new-come
Wise Ones had wanted to meet with one of the Aes Sedai who followed
the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, and although she was back on her feet
after Healing him, Moiraine claimed to have no time. Egwene had
been rousted from her blankets as a replacement.</p>

<p>That made Aviendha laugh. She had been outside when
Sorilea and Bair practically dragged Egwene from her tent, trying
to pull on her clothes while they hustled her along. &ldquo;I called to
her that she would have to dig holes in the ground with her teeth
this time if she had been caught in a misdeed, and she was so
sleepy she believed me. She began protesting that she would not, so
hard that Sorilea began demanding what she had done to think she
deserved to. You should have seen Egwene&rsquo;s face.&rdquo; She laughed so
hard that she nearly toppled over.</p>

<p>Asmodean actually looked at her askance&mdash;though
why he should, being what and who he was, was beyond Rand&mdash;but Rand only waited patiently until she caught her breath. For
Aiel humor, this was mild. More the sort of thing he would have
expected from Mat than from any woman, but mild even so.</p>

<p>When she straightened, wiping her eyes, he said,
&ldquo;What of the Shaido, then? Or are their Wise Ones also at this
conclave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She answered still giggling into her wine; she
considered the Shaido finished, hardly worth considering now.
Thousands of prisoners had been taken, with a trickle still being
brought in, and the fighting had died down except for a few small
skirmishes here and there. Yet the more he got out of her, the less
he could see them as done for. With the four clans keeping Han
occupied, the bulk of Couladin&rsquo;s people had crossed the Gaelin in
good order, even carrying away most of the Cairhienin prisoners
they had captured. Worse, they had destroyed the stone bridges
behind them.</p>

<p>That did not concern her, but it did him. Tens of
thousands of Shaido north of the river, no way to get at them until
the bridges were replaced, and even wooden spans would take time.
It was time that he did not have.</p>

<p>At the very end, when it seemed there was no more to
say on the Shaido, she told him what made him forget worrying about
the Shaido and what trouble they would cause. She just tossed it
in, as if she had almost forgotten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat killed Couladin?&rdquo; he said incredulously when she
was done. &ldquo;Mat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I not say so?&rdquo; The words were sharp, but
halfhearted. Peering at him over her winecup, she seemed more
interested in how he would take the news than in whether he doubted
her word.</p>

<p>Asmodean plucked a few chords of something martial;
the harp seemed to echo to drums and trumpets. &ldquo;In some ways, a
young man of as many surprises as you. I truly look forward to
meeting the third of you, this Perrin, one day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. So Mat had not escaped the pull
of <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> to <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> after all. Or maybe it
was the Pattern that had caught him, and being <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>
himself. Either way, he suspected Mat was not too happy right that
moment. Mat had not learned the lesson that he had. Try to run
away, and the Pattern pulled you back, often roughly; run in the
direction the Wheel wove you, and sometimes you could manage a
little control over your life. Sometimes. With luck, maybe more
than any expected, at least in the long haul. But he had more
urgent concerns than Mat, or the Shaido.</p>

<p>A glance at the entrance told him the sun was well
up, though all he saw otherwise was two Maidens squatting just
outside, spears across their knees. A night and most of a morning
with him unconscious, and Sammael had either not tried to find him
or had failed.</p>

<p>He was careful to use that name, even to himself,
though another floated in the back of his mind now. Tel Janin
Aellinsar. No history recorded the name, no fragment in the library
at Tar Valon; Moiraine had told him everything the Aes Sedai knew
of the Forsaken, and it was little more than was told in village
tales. Even Asmodean had always called him Sammael, if for a
different reason. Long before the War of the Shadow ended, the
Forsaken had embraced the names men had given them, as if symbols
of rebirth in the Shadow. Asmodean&rsquo;s own true name&mdash;Joar
Addam Nesossin&mdash;made the man flinch, and he claimed to have
forgotten the others in the course of three thousand years.</p>

<p>Perhaps there was no real reason to hide what was
going on inside his head&mdash;maybe it was only an attempt to
deny reality to himself&mdash;but Sammael the man would remain.
And as Sammael, he would pay in full for every Maiden he had
killed. The Maidens Rand had not been able to keep safe.</p>

<p>Even as he made the resolution, he grimaced. He had
made a beginning by sending Weiramon back to Tear&mdash;the Light
willing, only he and Weiramon knew how much of one, so far&mdash;but he could not go chasing off after Sammael, whatever he wanted
or vowed. Not yet. There were matters to be seen to here in
Cairhien, first. Aviendha might think he did not understand <em>
ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>, and perhaps he did not, but he understood duty, and
he had one to Cairhien. Besides, there were ways to tail it in with
Weiramon.</p>

<p>Sitting up&mdash;and trying not to show the effort
of it&mdash;he covered himself as decently as he could in the
blanket and wondered where his clothes were; he did not see
anything but his boots, standing over behind Aviendha. She probably
knew. It might have been <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> who undressed him, but
it could just as easily have been she. &ldquo;I need to go into the city.
Natael, have Jeade&rsquo;en saddled and brought up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow, perhaps,&rdquo; Aviendha told him firmly,
catching Asmodean&rsquo;s coatsleeve as he started to rise. &ldquo;Moiraine
Sedai said you would need to rest for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today, Aviendha. Now. I don&rsquo;t know why Meilan isn&rsquo;t
here, if he&rsquo;s alive, but I mean to find out. Natael, my horse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put on a stubborn face, but Asmodean jerked his
arm free, smoothing the wrinkled velvet, and said, &ldquo;Meilan was
here, and others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was not to be told&mdash;&rdquo; Aviendha began
angrily, then tightened her mouth before finishing, &ldquo;He needs to
rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Wise Ones thought they could keep things from
him. Well, he was not as weak as they believed. He tried to stand,
holding the blanket close, and turned the motion into shifting his
position when his legs refused to cooperate. Maybe he was as weak
as they thought. But he did not intend to let that stop him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can rest when I&rsquo;m dead,&rdquo; he said, and wished he
had not when she flinched as if he had hit her. No, she would not
have flinched at a blow. His staying alive was important to her for
the Aiel&rsquo;s sake, and a threat there could hurt her more than a
fist. &ldquo;Tell me about Meilan, Natael.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha kept a sullen silence, though if looks had
had anything to do with it, Asmodean would have been struck dumb as
well.</p>

<p>A rider had come from Meilan in the night, bearing
flowery praises and assurances of undying loyalty. At dawn Meilan
himself appeared, with the six other High Lords of Tear who were in
the city and a small host of Tairen soldiers who fingered sword
hilts and gripped lances as though more than half expecting to
fight the Aiel who had stood silently watching them ride in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It came close,&rdquo; Asmodean said. &ldquo;This Meilan is not
used to being thwarted, I think, and the others scarcely more so.
Especially the lumpy-faced one&mdash;Torean?&mdash;and Simaan.
That one has eyes as sharp as his nose. You know I am used to
dangerous company, but these men are as dangerous in their way as
any I have known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha sniffed loudly. &ldquo;Whatever they are used to,
they had no choice with Sorilea and Amys and Bair and Melaine on
one side, and Sulin with a thousand <em>Far Dareis Mai</em> on the
other. And there were some Stone Dogs,&rdquo; she conceded, &ldquo;and a few
Water Seekers and some Red Shields. If you truly serve the <em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> as you claim, Jasin Natael, you should guard his
rest as they do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the Dragon Reborn I follow, young woman. The
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, I leave to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on, Natael,&rdquo; Rand said impatiently, earning a
sniff for himself.</p>

<p>She was right concerning the Tairens&rsquo; choices, though
perhaps the Maidens and others fingering their veils had concerned
them more than the Wise Ones. In any case, even Aracome, a graying,
slender man with a long-smoldering temper, had been near bursting
aflame by the time they reined their horses around, and Gueyam,
bald as a stone and wide as a blacksmith, was white-faced in rage.
Asmodean was not sure whether it had been the certainty of being
overwhelmed that stopped them drawing swords, or the realization
that if they somehow managed to cut a path to Rand, he was unlikely
to welcome them with his allies&rsquo; blood on their blades.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meilan&rsquo;s eyes were bulging out of his head,&rdquo; the man
finished. &ldquo;But before leaving, he shouted out his allegiance and
fealty to you. Perhaps he thought you might hear. The others echoed
him quickly, yet Meilan added something that made them stare. &lsquo;I
make a gift of Cairhien to the Lord Dragon,&rsquo; he said. Then he
announced that he would prepare a grand triumph for you when you&rsquo;re
ready to enter the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an old saying in the Two Rivers,&rdquo; Rand said
dryly. &ldquo;The louder a man tells you he&rsquo;s honest, the harder you must
hold on to your purse.&rdquo; Another said, &ldquo;The fox often offers to give
the duck its pond.&rdquo; Cairhien was his without gifts from Meilan.</p>

<p>He had no doubts about the man&rsquo;s loyalty. It would
last just as long as Meilan believed he would be destroyed if
caught betraying Rand. If caught; that was the hook. Those seven
High Lords in Cairhien had been the most assiduous in trying to see
him dead in Tear. That was why he had sent them here. Had he
executed every Tairen noble who plotted against him, there might
have been none left. At the time, handing them anarchy, famine and
civil war to deal with a thousand miles from Tear had seemed a good
way to put a crimp in their schemes while doing some good where it
needed doing. Of course, he had not even known Couladin existed
then, much less that the man would lead him to Cairhien.</p>

<p><em>It would be easier if this was a story</em>, he
thought. In stories, there were only so many surprises before the
hero knew everything he needed; he himself never seemed to know a
quarter of everything.</p>

<p>Asmodean hesitated&mdash;that old saying about
shouting men might be applied to him, too, as he was no doubt aware&mdash;but when Rand said no more, he added, &ldquo;I think he wants to
be King of Cairhien. Subject to you, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And preferably with me far away.&rdquo; Meilan probably
expected Rand to return to Tear, and to <em>Callandor</em>. Meilan
certainly would never be afraid of too much power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Asmodean sounded even drier than Rand
had. &ldquo;There was another visit between those two.&rdquo; A dozen
Cairhienin lords and ladies, without retainers, came cloaked and
with faces hidden in their hoods despite the heat. Plainly they
knew that the Aiel despised Cairhienin, and just as plainly
returned the sentiment, yet they were as nervous that Meilan might
discover they had come as that the Aiel might decide to kill them.
&ldquo;When they saw me,&rdquo; Asmodean said wryly, &ldquo;half seemed ready to kill
me for fear I was Tairen. You have <em>Far Dareis Mai</em> to thank
that you still have a bard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Few as they were, the Cairhienin had still been
harder to turn back than Meilan, growing sweatier and more
white-faced by the minute, but stubbornly demanding to see the Lord
Dragon. It was a measure of their desire that when demands failed,
they finally descended to open begging. Asmodean might have thought
Aiel humor odd or harsh, but he chuckled over nobles in silk coats
and riding dresses trying to pretend he was not there as they knelt
to catch at the Wise Ones&rsquo; woolen skirts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorilea threatened to have them stripped and flogged
back to the city.&rdquo; His muted laughter turned disbelieving. &ldquo;They
actually discussed it among themselves. Had the requirement allowed
them to reach you, I do believe some would have accepted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorilea should have done it,&rdquo; Aviendha put in,
surprisingly agreeable. &ldquo;The oathbreakers have no honor. At last
Melaine had the Maidens throw them across their horses like bundles
and run the animals from camp, with the oathbreakers hanging on as
they might.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Asmodean nodded. &ldquo;But before that, two of them did
speak to me, once they were certain I was not a Tairen spy. Lord
Dobraine, and Lady Colavaere. They clouded everything in so many
hints and innuendoes that I cannot be certain, but I would not be
surprised if they mean to offer you the Sun Throne. They could
bandy words with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;some people I used to be acquainted
with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand barked a laugh. &ldquo;Maybe they will. If they can
manage the same terms as Meilan.&rdquo; He had not needed Moiraine to
tell him that Cairhienin played the Game of Houses in their sleep,
nor Asmodean to tell him they would try it with the Forsaken. The
High Lords to the left and the Cairhienin to the right. One battle
done, and another, of a different sort if no less dangerous,
beginning. &ldquo;In any case, I mean the Sun Throne for someone who has
a right to it.&rdquo; He ignored the speculation on Asmodean&rsquo;s face;
perhaps the man had tried to help him the night before and perhaps
he had not, but he did not trust the fellow enough to let him know
half of his plans. However much Asmodean&rsquo;s future might be tied to
his, his loyalty was all necessity, and he was still the same man
who had chosen to give his soul to the Shadow. &ldquo;Meilan wants to
give me a grand entry when I am ready, does he? So much the better
that I see what&rsquo;s what before he expects me.&rdquo; It came to him why
Aviendha had become so agreeable, even helping the talk along. As
long as he sat here talking, he was doing exactly what she wanted.
&ldquo;Are you going to get my horse, Natael, or must I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Asmodean&rsquo;s bow was deep, formal, and on the surface,
at least, sincere. &ldquo;I serve the Lord Dragon.&rdquo;</p>
