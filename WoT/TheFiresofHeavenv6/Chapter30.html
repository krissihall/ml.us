<h4><em>A Wager</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">A</span>
 soft night breeze stirred across the small town of
Eianrod, then faded. Sitting on the stone rail of the wide flat
bridge in the heart of the town, Rand supposed the breeze was hot,
yet it hardly felt so after the Waste. Warm for nighttime perhaps,
but not enough to make him unbutton his red coat. The river below
him had never been large, and was half its normal width now, yet he
still enjoyed watching the water flow north, moonshadows cast by
scudding clouds playing across the darkly glittering surface. That
was why he was out here in the night, really; to look at running
water for a time. His wards were set, surrounding the Aiel
encampment that itself surrounded the town. The Aiel themselves
kept a watch a sparrow could not pierce unseen. He could waste an
hour being soothed by the flow of a river.</p>

<p>It was surely better than another night where he had
to order Moiraine to leave so he could study with Asmodean. She had
even taken to bringing his meals to him and talking while he ate,
as if she meant to cram everything she knew into his head before
they reached the city of Cairhien. He could not face her begging to
remain&mdash;actually begging!&mdash;as she had the previous
night. For a woman like Moiraine, that behavior was so unnatural
that he had wanted to agree simply to stop it. Which was very
likely why she had done it. Much better an hour listening to the
quiet liquid ripplings of the river. With luck, she would have
given up on him for tonight.</p>

<p>The eight or ten paces of clay between water and
weeds on both sides below him was dried and cracked. He peered up
at the clouds crossing the moon. He could try to make those clouds
give rain. The town&rsquo;s two fountains were both dry, and dust lay in
a third of the wells not fouled beyond cleaning. Try was the word,
though. He had made it rain once; remembering how was the trick. If
he managed that, then he could try not to make it a drowning deluge
and a tree-snapping windstorm this time.</p>

<p>Asmodean would be no help; he did not know much about
weather, it seemed. For every thing the man taught him, there were
two more that made Asmodean either throw up his hands or give a
lick and a promise. Once he had thought that the Forsaken knew
everything, that they were all but omnipotent. But if the others
were like Asmodean, they had ignorances as well as weaknesses. It
might actually be that he already knew more of some things than
they. Than some of them, at least. The problem would be finding out
who. Semirhage was almost as poor at handling weather as
Asmodean.</p>

<p>He shivered as if this were night in the Three-fold
Land. Asmodean had never told him that. Better to listen to the
water and not think, if he meant to sleep at all tonight.</p>

<p>Sulin approached him, the <em>shoufa</em> around her
shoulders so it uncovered her short white hair, and leaned on the
railing. The wiry Maiden was armed for battle, bow and arrows,
spears and knife and buckler. She had taken command of his
bodyguard tonight. Two dozen more <em>Far Dareis Mai</em> squatted
easily on the bridge ten paces away. &ldquo;An odd night,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We
were gambling, but suddenly everyone was throwing nothing but
sixes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he told her without thinking, and she
gave him a peculiar look. She did not know, of course; he had not
spread it about. The ripples he gave off as <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>
spread out in odd, random ways. Even the Aiel would not want to be
within ten miles of him, if they knew.</p>

<p>The ground had given way beneath three Stone Dogs
today, dropping them into a viper pit, but none of the dozens of
bites had found anything but cloth. He knew that had been him,
bending chance. Tal Nethin, the saddlemaker, had survived Taien to
trip on a stone this very noon and break his neck falling on flat,
grassy ground. Rand was afraid that had been him, too. On the other
hand, Bael and Jheran had mended the blood feud between Shaarad and
Goshien while he was with them, eating a midday meal of dried meat
on the move. They still did not like each other, and hardly seemed
to understand what they had done, but it <em>was</em> done, with
pledges and water oaths given, each man holding the cup for the
other to drink. To Aiel, water oaths were stronger than any other;
it might be generations before Shaarad and Goshien so much as
raided each other for sheep or goats or cattle.</p>

<p>He had wondered if those random effects would ever
work in his favor; maybe this was as close as it came. What else
had happened today that might be laid at his feet, he did not know;
he never asked, and would as soon not hear. The Baels and Jherans
could only partly make up for the Tal Nethins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not seen Enaila or Adelin for days,&rdquo; he said.
It was as good a change of subject as any. That pair in particular
had seemed to be jealous of their places guarding him. &ldquo;Are they
ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If anything, the look Sulin gave him was even more
peculiar. &ldquo;They will return when they learn to stop playing with
dolls, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He opened his mouth, then closed it again. Aiel were
strange&mdash;Aviendha&rsquo;s lessons often made them more so, not less&mdash;but this was ridiculous. &ldquo;Well, tell them they are grown
women and they ought to act it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even by moonlight he could tell that her smile was
pleased. &ldquo;It shall be as the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> wishes.&rdquo; What did
that mean? She eyed him a moment, lips pursed thoughtfully. &ldquo;You
have not eaten yet tonight. There is still enough food for
everyone, and you will not fill one belly by going hungry yourself.
If you do not eat, people will worry that <em>you</em> are ill. You
will become ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed softly, a hoarse wheeze. The <em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> one minute, and the next&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;If he did not fetch
something to eat, Sulin would probably go get it for him. And try
to feed him to boot. &ldquo;I will eat. Moiraine must be in her blankets
by now.&rdquo; This time her, odd look was satisfying; for a change he
had said something that she did not understand.</p>

<p>As he swung his feet down, he heard the ring of
horses&rsquo; hooves walking down the stone-paved street toward the
bridge. Every Maiden was upright in an instant, face veiled; half
nocked arrows. His hand went to his waist by instinct, but the
sword was not there. The Aiel felt strange enough about him riding
a horse and carrying the thing at his saddle; he had not seen any
need to offend their customs more by wearing it. Besides, there
were not many horses, and they were coming at a walk.</p>

<p>When they appeared, surrounded by an escort of fifty
Aiel, the riders numbered fewer than twenty, slumping in their
saddles dejectedly. Most wore rimmed helmets and Tairen coats with
puffy, striped sleeves beneath their breastplates. The pair in the
lead had ornately gilded cuirasses, and large white plumes attached
to the front of their helmets, and the stripes on their sleeves had
the glisten of satin in the moonlight. Half-a-dozen men at the
rear, though, shorter and slighter than the Tairens, two with
small banners called <em>con</em> on short staffs harnessed to their backs,
wore dark coats and helmets shaped like bells cut away to expose
their faces. Cairhienin used the banners to pick out officers in
battle, and also to mark a lord&rsquo;s personal retainers.</p>

<p>The Tairens with plumes stared when they saw him,
exchanged startled glances, then scrambled down to come kneel
before him, helmets under their arms. They were young, little older
than he, both with dark beards trimmed to neat points in the
fashion of Tairen nobility. Dents marred their breastplates, and
the gilding was chipped; they had been crossing swords somewhere.
Neither as much as glanced at the Aiel surrounding them, as if when
ignored they would disappear. The Maidens unveiled, though they
looked no less ready to put spear or arrow through the kneeling
men.</p>

<p>Rhuarc followed the Tairens, with a gray-eyed Aiel
younger and slightly taller than he, and stood behind. Mangin was
of the Jindo Taardad, and one of those who had gone to the Stone of
Tear. Jindo had brought in the riders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Dragon,&rdquo; the plump, pink-cheeked lordling
said, &ldquo;burn my soul, but have they taken <em>you</em> prisoner?&rdquo;
His companion, jug ears and potato nose making him look a farmer
despite his beard, kept sweeping lanky hair from his forehead
nervously. &ldquo;They said they were taking us to some Dawn fellow. The
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>. Means something about chiefs, if I remember
what my tutor said. Forgive me, my Lord Dragon. I am Edorion of
House Selorna, and this is Estean of House Andiama.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am He Who Comes With the Dawn,&rdquo; Rand told them
quietly. &ldquo;And the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>.&rdquo; He had them placed now:
young lords who had spent their time drinking, gambling and chasing
women when he was in the Stone. Estean&rsquo;s eyes nearly popped out of
his face; Edorion looked as surprised for a moment, then nodded
slowly, as if he suddenly saw how it made sense. &ldquo;Stand. Who are
your Cairhienin companions?&rdquo; It would be interesting to meet
Cairhienin who were not running for their lives from the Shaido,
and any other Aiel they saw. For that matter, if they were with
Edorion and Estean, they might be the first supporters he had met
in this land. If the two Tairens&rsquo; fathers had followed his orders.
&ldquo;Bring them forward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Estean blinked in surprise as he rose, but Edorion
barely paused in turning to shout, &ldquo;Meresin! Daricain! Come here!&rdquo;
Much like calling dogs. The Cairhienins&rsquo; banners bobbed as they
dismounted slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Dragon.&rdquo; Estean hesitated, licking his lips
as though thirsty. &ldquo;Did you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Did you send the Aiel against
Cairhien?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve attacked the city, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhuarc nodded, and Mangin said, &ldquo;If these are to be
believed, Cairhien still holds. Or did three days ago.&rdquo; There was
little doubt that he did not think it still did, and less that he
cared about a city of treekillers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not send them, Estean,&rdquo; Rand said as they were
joined by the two Cairhienin, who knelt, doffing their helmets to
reveal men of an age with Edorion and Estean, their hair shaved
back in line with their ears and their dark eyes wary. &ldquo;Those who
attack the city are my enemies, the Shaido. I mean to save Cairhien
if it can be saved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had to go through the business of telling the
Cairhienin to rise; his time with the Aiel had almost made him
forget the habit this side of the Spine of the World, bowing and
kneeling right and left. He had to ask for introductions, too, and
the Cairhienin gave them themselves. Lieutenant Lord Meresin of
House Daganred&mdash;his <em>con</em> was all wavy vertical lines
of red and white&mdash;and Lieutenant Lord Daricain of House
Annallin, his <em>con</em> covered with small squares of red and
black. It was a surprise that they were lords. Though lords
commanded and led soldiers in Cairhien, they did not shave their
heads and become soldiers. Or had not; much had changed,
apparently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Dragon.&rdquo; Meresin stumbled a bit saying that.
He and Daricain were both pale, slender men, with narrow faces and
long noses, but he was a bit the heavier. Neither looked as if he
had had much to eat lately. Meresin rushed on as if afraid of being
interrupted. &ldquo;My Lord Dragon, Cairhien can hold. For days yet,
perhaps as many as ten or twelve, but you must come quickly if you
are to save it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is why we came out,&rdquo; Estean said, shooting
Meresin a dark look. Both Cairhienin returned it, but their
defiance was tinged with resignation. Estean raked stringy hair
from his forehead. &ldquo;To find help. Parties have been sent in every
direction, my Lord Dragon.&rdquo; He shivered despite the sweat on his
brow, and his voice turned distant and hollow. &ldquo;There were more of
us when we started. I saw Baran go down, screaming with a spear
through his guts. He&rsquo;ll never turn a card at chop again. I could
use a mug of strong brandy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edorion turned his helmet in gauntleted hands,
frowning. &ldquo;My Lord Dragon, the city can hold a while longer, but
even if these Aiel will fight those, the question is, can you bring
them there in time? I think ten or twelve days is a more than
generous estimate, myself. In truth, I only came because I thought
dying with a spear through me would be better than being taken
alive when they made it over the walls. The city is packed with
refugees who fled ahead of the Aiel; there isn&rsquo;t a dog or a pigeon
left in the city, and I doubt there will be a rat left soon. The
one good thing is that no one seems to be worrying very much about
who will take the Sun Throne, not with this Couladin outside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He called on us to surrender to He Who Comes With
the Dawn, on the second day,&rdquo; Daricain put in, earning a sharp look
from Edorion for the interruption.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couladin has some sport with prisoners,&rdquo; Estean
said. &ldquo;Out of bowshot, but where anyone on the walls can see. You
can hear them screaming, too. The Light burn my soul, I don&rsquo;t know
whether he is trying to break our will or simply likes it.
Sometimes they let peasants make a run for the city, then shoot
them full of arrows when they&rsquo;re almost safe. However safe Cairhien
is. Only peasants, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He trailed off and swallowed hard, as
if he had just remembered what Rand&rsquo;s opinions were of &ldquo;only
peasants.&rdquo; Rand just looked at him, but he seemed to shrivel, and
muttered under his breath about brandy.</p>

<p>Edorion leaped into the momentary silence. &ldquo;My Lord
Dragon, the point is that the city can hold until you come, if you
can come quickly. We only beat back the first assault because the
Foregate caught fire&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flames nearly took the city,&rdquo; Estean interjected.
The Foregate, a city in itself outside the walls of Cairhien, had
been mostly wood, as Rand remembered. &ldquo;Would have been disaster if
the river was not right there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other Tairen went on right over him. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but
Lord Meilan has the defense well planned, and the Cairhienin appear
to be keeping their backbones for the time.&rdquo; That earned him frowns
from Meresin and Daricain that he either did not see or pretended
not to. &ldquo;Seven days with luck, perhaps eight at most. If you can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; A heavy sigh abruptly seemed to deflate Edorion&rsquo;s plumpness.
&ldquo;I did not see one horse,&rdquo; he said as if to himself. &ldquo;The Aiel do
not ride. You will never be able to move men afoot so far in
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long?&rdquo; Rand asked Rhuarc.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seven days&rdquo; was the reply. Mangin nodded, and Estean
laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn my soul, it took us as long to reach here on
horses. If you think you can make the return in the same afoot, you
must be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Becoming aware of the Aiel eyes on him, Estean
scrubbed the hair from his face. &ldquo;Is there any brandy in this
town?&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t how fast we can make it,&rdquo; Rand said
quietly, &ldquo;but how fast you can, if you dismount some of your men
and use their horses for spares. I want to let Meilan and Cairhien
know that help is on the way. But whoever goes will have to be sure
he can keep his mouth shut if the Shaido take him. I do not intend
to let Couladin know any more than he can learn on his own.&rdquo; Estean
went whiter in the face than the Cairhienin.</p>

<p>Meresin and Daricain were on their knees together,
each seizing one of Rand&rsquo;s hands to kiss. He let them, with as much
patience as he could find; one bit of Moiraine&rsquo;s advice that had
the ring of common sense was not to offend people&rsquo;s customs,
however strange or even repulsive, unless you absolutely had to,
and even then think twice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will go, my Lord Dragon,&rdquo; Meresin said
breathlessly. &ldquo;Thank you, my Lord Dragon. Thank you. Under the
Light, I vow I will die before revealing a word to any but my
father or the High Lord Meilan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grace favor you, my Lord Dragon,&rdquo; the other added.
&ldquo;Grace favor you, and the Light illumine you forever. I am your man
to the death.&rdquo; Rand let Meresin say that he also was Rand&rsquo;s man
before taking his hands back firmly and telling them to stand. He
did not like the way they were looking at him. Edorion had called
them like hounds, but men should not look at anyone as if they were
dogs gazing at a master.</p>

<p>Edorion drew a deep breath, puffing his pink cheeks,
and let it out slowly. &ldquo;I suppose if I made it out in one piece, I
can make it back in. My Lord Dragon, forgive me if I offend, but
would you care to wager, say, a thousand gold crowns, that you can
really come in seven days?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared at him. The man was as bad as Mat. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t have a hundred crowns silver, much less a thousand in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sulin broke in. &ldquo;He has it, Tairen,&rdquo; she said firmly.
&ldquo;He will meet your wager, if you make it ten thousand by
weight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edorion laughed. &ldquo;Done, Aiel. And worth every copper
if I lose. Come to think, I&rsquo;ll not live to collect if I win. Come,
Meresin, Daricain.&rdquo; It sounded as if he were summoning dogs to
heel. &ldquo;We ride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand waited until the three had made their bows and
were halfway back to the horses before rounding on the white-haired
Maiden. &ldquo;What do you mean, I have a thousand gold crowns? I&rsquo;ve
never <em>seen</em> a thousand crowns, much less ten thousand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Maidens exchanged glances as if he were demented;
so did Rhuarc and Mangin. &ldquo;A fifth of the treasure that was in the
Stone of Tear belongs to those who took the Stone, and will be
claimed when they can carry it away.&rdquo; Sulin spoke as to a child,
instructing it in the simple facts of everyday life. &ldquo;As chief and
battle leader there, one tenth of that fifth is yours. Tear
submitted to you as chief by right of triumph, so one tenth of Tear
is yours as well. And you have said we can take the fifth in these
lands&mdash;a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;tax, you called it.&rdquo; She fumbled the word; the
Aiel did not have taxes. &ldquo;The tenth part of that is yours also, as
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. In all of his talks with
Aviendha, he had never thought to ask whether the fifth applied to
him; he was not Aiel, <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> or no, and it had not
seemed anything to do with him. Well, it might not be a tax, but he
could use it as kings did taxes. Unfortunately, he had only the
vaguest idea how that was. He would have to ask Moiraine; that was
one thing she had missed in her lectures. Perhaps she thought it so
obvious that he should know.</p>

<p>Elayne would have known what taxes were used for; it
had certainly been more fun taking advice from her than from
Moiraine. He wished he knew where she was. Still in Tanchico,
probably; Egwene told him little more than a constant string of
well-wishings. He wished he could sit Elayne down and make her
explain those two letters. Maiden of the Spear or Daughter-Heir of
Andor, women were strange. Except maybe Min. She had laughed at
him, but she had never made him think she was speaking some strange
language. She would not laugh, now. If he ever saw her again, she
would run a hundred miles to get away from the Dragon Reborn.</p>

<p>Edorion dismounted all his men, taking one of their
horses and stringing the others together by their reins, along with
Estean&rsquo;s. No doubt he was saving his own for the final sprint
through the Shaido. Merisin and Daricain did the same with their
men. Though it meant that the Cairhienin had only two spare mounts
apiece, no one seemed to think they should have any of the Tairen
horses. They clattered off together westward at a trot, with a
Jindo escort.</p>

<p>Carefully not looking at anyone, Estean started to
drift toward the soldiers standing uneasily in a circle of Aiel at
the foot of the bridge. Mangin caught his red-striped sleeve. &ldquo;You
can tell us conditions inside Cairhien, wetlander.&rdquo; The lumpy-faced
man looked ready to faint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am certain he will answer any questions you ask,&rdquo;
Rand said sharply, emphasizing the final word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will only be asked,&rdquo; Rhuarc said, taking the
Tairen&rsquo;s other arm. He and Mangin seemed to be holding the much
shorter man up between them. &ldquo;Warning the city&rsquo;s defenders is well
and good, Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; Rhuarc went on, &ldquo;but we should send
scouts. Running, they can reach Cairhien as soon as those men on
horses, and meet us coming back with word of how Couladin has
disposed the Shaido.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand could feel the Maiden&rsquo;s eyes on him, but he
looked straight at Rhuarc. &ldquo;Thunder Walkers?&rdquo; he suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Sha&rsquo;mad Conde</em>,&rdquo; Rhuarc agreed. He and
Mangin turned Estean&mdash;they <em>were</em> holding him up&mdash;and started toward the other soldiers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask!&rdquo; Rand called after them. &ldquo;He is your ally, and
my liege man.&rdquo; He had no idea whether Estean was that last or not&mdash;it was another thing to ask Moiraine; or even how much of an
ally he really was&mdash;his father, the High Lord Torean, had
plotted against Rand enough&mdash;but he would allow nothing close
to Couladin&rsquo;s ways.</p>

<p>Rhuarc turned his head and nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You tend your people well, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo; Sulin&rsquo;s
voice was flat as a planed plank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I try,&rdquo; he told her. He was not about to rise to the
bait. Whoever went to scout the Shaido, some would not return, and
that was that. &ldquo;I think I will have something to eat now. And get
some sleep.&rdquo; It could not be much more than two hours to midnight,
and sunrise still came early this time of year. The Maidens
followed him, watching the shadows warily as if they expected
attack, handtalk flickering among them. But then, Aiel always
seemed to expect attack.</p>
