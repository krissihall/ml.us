<h4><em>What Can Be Learned in Dreams</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">C</span>arefully
Nynaeve formed an image in her mind of the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s study, just as she had envisioned the Heart of the Stone
on going to sleep. Nothing happened, and she frowned. She should
have been taken to the White Tower, to the room she had visualized.
Trying again, she imagined a room there that she had visited much
more often, if more unhappily.</p>

<p>The Heart of the Stone became the study of the
Mistress of Novices, a compact, dark-paneled room full of plain,
sturdy furnishings that had been used by generations of women who
had held that office. When a novice&rsquo;s transgressions were such that
extra hours of scrubbing floors or raking paths would not atone, it
was here that she was sent. For an Accepted to receive that summons
took a greater transgression, but still she went, on leaden feet,
knowing the outcome would be just as painful, perhaps more so.</p>

<p>Nynaeve did not want to look at the room&mdash;Sheriam had called her willfully stubborn on her numerous visits&mdash;but found herself staring into the mirror on the wall, where
novices and Accepted had to look at their own weeping faces while
listening to Sheriam lecture about obeying the rules or showing
proper respect or whatever. Obeying others&rsquo; rules and showing
required respect had always tripped up Nynaeve. The faint remnants
of gilt on the carved frame said it had been there since the War of
the Hundred Years, if not the Breaking.</p>

<p>The Taraboner dress was beautiful, but anyone who saw
her in it would be suspicious. Even Domani women usually dressed
circumspectly when they visited the Tower, and she could not
imagine anybody dreaming of herself in the Tower except on her best
behavior. Not that she was likely to meet anyone, except perhaps
someone who had dreamed herself into <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> for a
few moments; before Egwene, there had not been a woman in the Tower
who could enter the World of Dreams unaided since Corianin Nedeal,
over four hundred years ago. On the other hand, among the
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> stolen from the Tower that were still in the
hands of Liandrin and her confederates, eleven had last been
studied by Corianin. The two others of Corianin&rsquo;s study, the two
that she and Elayne had in hand, both gave access to
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>; it was best to assume that the rest did,
too. There was small chance that Liandrin or any of the others
would dream themselves back to the Tower they had fled, but even
that chance was too big to risk when it might mean being waylaid.
For that matter, she could not really be sure that the stolen
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> were all that Corianin had investigated. The
records were often murky about <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> no one
understood, and others could very well be in the hands of Black
sisters still in the Tower.</p>

<p>The dress changed completely, became white wool, soft
but not of a particularly fine quality, and banded at the hem with
seven colored stripes, one for each Ajah. If she saw anyone who did
not vanish after a few moments, she would take herself back to
Sienda, and they would think she was only one of the Accepted,
touching <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> in her dreams. No. Not the inn,
but Sheriam&rsquo;s study. Anyone like that would have to be Black Ajah,
and after all, she was supposed to be hunting them.</p>

<p>Completing her disguise, she gripped her suddenly
red-gold braid and grimaced at Melaine&rsquo;s face in the mirror. Now,
there was a woman she would like to hand over to Sheriam.</p>

<p>The study of the Mistress of Novices was near the
novices&rsquo; quarters, and the wide, tiled hallways flickered with
occasional motion past elaborate wall hangings and unlit
stand-lamps; flashes of frightened girls all in novice white. A
good many novice nightmares would contain Sheriam. She ignored them
as she hurried by; they were not in the World of Dreams long enough
to see her, or if they did they would simply think her part of
their own dream.</p>

<p>It was only a short climb up broad stairs to the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s study. As she approached, suddenly Elaida was in front of
her, sweaty-faced in a blood-red gown, the stole of the Amyrlin
Seat around her shoulders. Or almost the Amyrlin&rsquo;s stole; it had no
blue stripe.</p>

<p>Those stern dark eyes focused on Nynaeve. &ldquo;I am the
Amyrlin Seat, girl! Do you not know how to show respect? I will
have yo&mdash;&rdquo; In midword, she was gone.</p>

<p>Nynaeve exhaled raggedly. Elaida as Amyrlin; that was
a nightmare for certain. <em>Probably her fondest dream</em>, she
thought wryly. <em>It will snow in Tear before</em> she <em>ever
rises that high</em>.</p>

<p>The anteroom was much as she remembered it, with one
wide table and a chair behind it for the Keeper of the Chronicles.
A few chairs sat against the wall for Aes Sedai waiting to speak
with the Amyrlin; novices and Accepted stood. The neat array of
papers on the table, bound scrolls and large parchments with seals
and letters, seemed unlike Leane, though. Not that she was untidy,
quite the reverse, yet Nynaeve had always thought she would put
everything away at night.</p>

<p>She pushed open the door to the inner room, but her
step slowed as she entered. No wonder she had not been able to
dream herself here; the room was nothing like what she remembered.
That heavily carved table and tall, throne-like chair. The
vine-carved stools arranged in a perfect curve in front of the
table, not one so much as an inch out of place. Siuan Sanche
affected simple furnishings, as if pretending she was still only a
fisherman&rsquo;s daughter, and she kept only one extra chair, which she
did not always let visitors use. And that white vase full of red
roses, rigidly arranged on a pedestal like a monument. Siuan
enjoyed flowers, but she preferred a bouquet of colors, like a
field of wildflowers in miniature. Above the fireplace had hung a
simple drawing of fishing boats in tall reeds. Now there were two
paintings, one of which Nynaeve recognized. Rand, battling the
Forsaken who had called himself Ba&rsquo;alzamon, in the clouds above
Falme. The other, on three wooden panels, portrayed scenes that
linked to nothing she could pull out of her memory.</p>

<p>The door opened, and Nynaeve&rsquo;s heart leaped into her
throat. A red-haired Accepted she had never seen before stepped
into the room and stared at her. She did not wink out of existence.
Just as Nynaeve was preparing to leap back to Sheriam&rsquo;s study, the
red-haired woman said, &ldquo;Nynaeve, if Melaine knew you were using her
face, she&rsquo;d do more than put you in a child&rsquo;s dress.&rdquo; And just that
suddenly she was Egwene, in her Aiel garb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You nearly frightened ten years out of me,&rdquo; Nynaeve
muttered. &ldquo;So the Wise Ones have finally decided to let you come
and go as you please? Or is Melaine behind&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should be frightened,&rdquo; Egwene snapped, color
rising in her cheeks. &ldquo;You are a fool, Nynaeve. A child playing in
the barn with a candle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve gaped. <em>Egwene</em> berating <em>her</em>?
&ldquo;You listen to me, Egwene al&rsquo;Vere. I&rsquo;ll not take that from Melaine,
and I won&rsquo;t take it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had best take it from someone, before you get
yourself killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ought to take that stone ring away from you. I
should have given it to Elayne and told her not to let you use it
at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Told her not&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think Melaine was exaggerating?&rdquo; Egwene said
sternly, shaking her finger almost exactly like Melaine. &ldquo;She was
not, Nynaeve. The Wise Ones have told you the simple truth about
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> time and again, but you seem to think
they&rsquo;re fools whistling in a high wind. You are supposed to be a
grown woman, not a silly little child. I vow, whatever sense you
once had in your head seems to have vanished like a puff of smoke.
Well, find it, Nynaeve!&rdquo; She sniffed loudly, rearranging the shawl
on her shoulders. &ldquo;Right now you are trying to play with the pretty
flames in the fireplace, too foolish to realize you might fall
in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve stared in amazement. They argued often
enough, but Egwene had never ever tried to dress her down like a
girl caught with her fingers in the honey jar. Never! The dress. It
was the Accepted&rsquo;s dress she was wearing, and someone else&rsquo;s face.
She changed herself back to herself, in a good blue wool that she
had often worn for Circle meetings and to put the Council straight.
She felt robed in all her old authority as Wisdom. &ldquo;I am well aware
of how much I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said levelly, &ldquo;but those Aiel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you realize you could dream yourself into
something you could not get out of? Dreams are real here. If you
let yourself drift into a fond dream, it could trap you. You&rsquo;d trap
yourself. Until you died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are nightmares walking
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, Nynaeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you let me speak?&rdquo; Nynaeve barked. Or rather,
she tried to bark it; there was rather too much frustrated pleading
in there to suit her. Any at all would have been too much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I will not,&rdquo; Egwene said firmly. &ldquo;Not until you
want to say something worth listening to. I said nightmares, and I
meant nightmares, Nynaeve. When someone has a nightmare while in
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, it is real too. And sometimes it survives
after the dreamer has gone. You just don&rsquo;t realize, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly rough hands enveloped Nynaeve&rsquo;s arms. Her
head whipped from side to side, eyes bulging. Two huge, ragged men
lifted her into the air, faces half-melted ruins of coarse flesh,
drooling mouths full of sharp, yellowed teeth. She tried to make
them vanish&mdash;if a Wise One dreamwalker could, so could she&mdash;and one of them ripped her dress open down the front like
parchment. The other seized her chin in a horny, callused hand and
twisted her face toward him; his head bent toward her, mouth
opening. Whether to kiss or bite, she did not know, but she would
rather die than allow either. She flailed for <em>saidar</em> and
found nothing; it was horror filling her, not anger. Thick
fingernails dug into her cheeks, holding her head steady. Egwene
had done this, somehow. Egwene. &ldquo;Please, Egwene!&rdquo; It was a squeal,
and she was too terrified to care. &ldquo;Please!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men&mdash;creatures&mdash;vanished, and her
feet thudded to the floor. For a moment all she could do was
shudder and weep. Hastily she repaired the damage to her dress, but
the scratches from long fingernails remained on her neck and chest.
Clothing could be mended easily in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, but
whatever happened to a human&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Her knees shook so badly that it
was all she could do to stay upright.</p>

<p>She half-expected Egwene to comfort her, and for once
she would have accepted it gladly. But the other woman only said,
&ldquo;There are worse things here, but nightmares are bad enough. I made
these, and unmade them, but even I have trouble with those I just
find. And I did not try to hold them, Nynaeve. If you knew how to
unmake them, you could have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve tossed her head angrily, refusing to scrub
the tears from her cheeks. &ldquo;I could have dreamed myself away. To
Sheriam&rsquo;s study, or back to my bed.&rdquo; She did not sound sulky. Of
course she did not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you had not been too scared spitless to think of
it,&rdquo; Egwene said dryly. &ldquo;Oh, take that sullen look off your face.
It looks silly on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She glared at the other woman, but it did not work as
it usually did. Instead of flaring into argument, Egwene merely
arched an eyebrow at her. &ldquo;None of this looks like Siuan Sanche,&rdquo;
Nynaeve said to change the subject. What had gotten into the
girl?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Egwene agreed, looking around the room.
&ldquo;I see why I had to come by way of my old room in the novices&rsquo;
quarters. But I suppose people do decide to try something new
sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is what I mean,&rdquo; Nynaeve told her patiently.
She had not sounded sulky, and she had not looked sullen. It was
ridiculous. &ldquo;The woman who furnished this room doesn&rsquo;t look at the
world the same as the woman who chose what used to be here. Look at
those paintings. I don&rsquo;t know what the triple thing is, but you can
recognize the other as well as I.&rdquo; They had both seen it
happen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bonwhin, I should say,&rdquo; Egwene said thoughtfully.
&ldquo;You never did listen to the lectures as you should. It is a
triptych.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever it is, it&rsquo;s the other that&rsquo;s important.&rdquo;
She had listened to the Yellows well enough. The rest was a pack of
useless nonsense often as not. &ldquo;It seems to me that the woman who
hung it wants to be reminded how dangerous Rand is. If Siuan Sanche
has turned against Rand for some reason&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Egwene, this could be
far worse than just her wanting Elayne back in the Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Egwene said judiciously. &ldquo;Maybe the papers
will tell us something. You search in here. When I finish with
Leane&rsquo;s desk, I will help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve stared indignantly at Egwene&rsquo;s back as she
left. <em>You search in here, indeed!</em> Egwene had no right to
give her orders. She ought to march right after her and tell her so
in no uncertain terms. <em>Then why are you standing here like a
lump?</em> she asked herself angrily. Searching the papers was a
good idea, and she might as well do so in here as out there. In
fact, the Amyrlin&rsquo;s desk was more likely to hold something
important. Grumbling to herself about what she would do to set
Egwene straight, she stalked to the thickly carved table, kicking
her skirts with every step.</p>

<p>There was nothing on the table except three ornately
lacquered boxes, arrayed with painful precision. Remembering the
sorts of traps that could be set by someone wanting to insure
privacy, she made a long stick to push open the hinged lid of the
first, a gold and green thing decorated with wading herons. It was
a writing case, with pens and ink and sand. The largest box, with
red roses twining through golden scrolls, held twenty or more
delicate carvings of ivory and turquoise, animals and people, all
laid out on pale gray velvet.</p>

<p>As she pushed up the lid of the third box&mdash;golden hawks fighting among white clouds in a blue sky&mdash;she
noticed that the first two were closed again. Things like that
happened here; everything seemed to want to remain as it was in the
waking world, and on top of that, if you took your eyes away for a
moment, details could be different when you looked back.</p>

<p>The third box did hold documents. The stick vanished,
and she gingerly lifted out the top sheet of parchment. Formally
signed &ldquo;Joline Aes Sedai,&rdquo; it was a humble request to serve a set
of penances that made Nynaeve wince just scanning them rapidly.
Nothing there that mattered, except to Joline. A scrawl at the
bottom said &ldquo;approved&rdquo; in angular script. As she reached to put the
parchment down, it faded away; the box was closed, too.</p>

<p>Sighing, she opened it again. The papers inside
looked different. Holding the lid, she lifted them out one by one
and read quickly. Or tried to read. Sometimes the letters and
reports vanished while she was still picking them up, sometimes
when she was no more than halfway down a page. If they had a
salutation, it was simply, &ldquo;Mother, with respect.&rdquo; Some were signed
by Aes Sedai, others by women with other titles, nobles, or no
honorific at all. None of it seemed to bear on the matter at hand.
The Marshal General of Saldaea and his army could not be found, and
Queen Tenobia was refusing to cooperate; she managed to finish that
report, but it assumed that the reader knew why the man was not in
Saldaea and what the queen was supposed to be cooperating about. No
report had come from any Ajah&rsquo;s eyes-and-ears in Tanchico for three
weeks; but she got no further than that one fact. Some trouble
between Illian on one side and Murandy on the other was abating,
and Pedron Niall was claiming credit; even in the few lines she got
she could see the writer&rsquo;s teeth gnashing. The letters were all no
doubt very important, those she was able to hurry through and those
that faded away under her eyes, but of no use to her at all. She
had just begun what seemed to be a report on a suspected&mdash;that was the word used&mdash;gathering of Blue sisters, when a
wretched cry of &ldquo;Oh, Light, no!&rdquo; came from the outer room.</p>

<p>Darting for the door, she made a stout wooden club
appear in her hands, its head bristling with spikes. But when she
dashed in expecting to find Egwene defending herself, the woman was
standing behind the Keeper&rsquo;s table staring at nothing. With a look
of horror on her face, to be sure, but still unharmed and
unthreatened that Nynaeve could see.</p>

<p>Egwene gave a start at the sight of her, then
gathered herself visibly. &ldquo;Nynaeve, Elaida is Amyrlin Seat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a goose,&rdquo; Nynaeve scoffed. Yet the other
room, so unlike Siuan Sanche&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re imagining things. You
must be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a parchment in my hands, Nynaeve, signed
&lsquo;Elaida do Avriny a&rsquo;Roihan, Watcher of the Seals, Flame of Tar
Valon, The Amyrlin Seat,&rsquo; and sealed with the Amyrlin&rsquo;s seal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s stomach tried to flutter up into her chest.
&ldquo;But how? What has happened to Siuan? Egwene, the Tower doesn&rsquo;t
depose an Amyrlin except for something serious. Only two in nearly
three thousand years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe Rand was serious enough.&rdquo; Egwene&rsquo;s voice was
steady, though her eyes were still too wide. &ldquo;Maybe she became ill
with something the Yellows couldn&rsquo;t Heal, or fell down the stairs
and broke her neck. What matters is that Elaida is Amyrlin. I don&rsquo;t
think she will support Rand as Siuan did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine,&rdquo; Nynaeve muttered. &ldquo;So sure that Siuan
would put the Tower behind him.&rdquo; She could not imagine Siuan Sanche
dead. She had hated the woman often, been the slightest bit afraid
of her on occasion&mdash;she could admit that now, to herself
anyway&mdash;yet she had respected her, too. She had thought that
Siuan would last forever. &ldquo;Elaida. Light! She&rsquo;s as mean as a snake
and as cruel as a cat. There&rsquo;s no telling what she might do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I have a clue.&rdquo; Egwene pressed both
hands to her stomach as though to quell flutters of her own. &ldquo;It
was a very short document. I managed to read it all. &lsquo;All loyal
sisters are required to report the presence of the woman Moiraine
Damodred. She is to be detained if possible, by whatever means are
necessary, and returned to the White Tower for trial on charge of
treason.&rsquo; The same sort of language that was apparently used about
Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Elaida wants Moiraine arrested, it must mean she
knows Moiraine has been helping Rand, and she does not like it.&rdquo;
Talking was good. Talking kept her from sicking up. Treason. They
stilled women for that. She had wanted to bring Moiraine down. Now
Elaida was going to do it for her. &ldquo;She certainly won&rsquo;t support
Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loyal sisters. Egwene, that fits with the Macura
woman&rsquo;s message. Whatever happened to Siuan, the Ajahs have split
over Elaida as Amyrlin. It must be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. Very good, Nynaeve. I did not see
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her smile was so pleased that Nynaeve smiled back.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a report on Siu&mdash;the Amyrlin&rsquo;s writing table about a
gathering of Blues. I was just reading it when you shouted. I&rsquo;ll
wager the Blues didn&rsquo;t support Elaida.&rdquo; The Blue and Red Ajahs had
a sort of armed truce at the best of times, and came near going for
each other&rsquo;s throats at the worst.</p>

<p>But when they went back into the inner room, the
report was not to be found. There were plenty of documents&mdash;Joline&rsquo;s letter had reappeared; a brief reading made Egwene&rsquo;s
eyebrows climb nearly to her hair&mdash;but not the one that they
wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you remember what it said?&rdquo; Egwene asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had just gotten a few lines when you shouted, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I just can&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try, Nynaeve. Try very hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, Egwene, but it will not come. I <em>am</em>
trying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What she was doing hit Nynaeve like a sudden hammer
between the eyes. Excusing herself. To Egwene, a girl whose bottom
she had switched for throwing a tantrum not more than two years
ago. And a moment earlier she had been proud as a hen with a new
egg because Egwene was pleased with her. She remembered quite
clearly the day when the balance between them had shifted, when
they ceased being the Wisdom and the girl who fetched when the
Wisdom said fetch, becoming instead just two women far from home.
It seemed that balance had shifted further, and she did not like
it. She was going to have to do something to move it back where it
belonged.</p>

<p>The lie. She had deliberately lied to Egwene for the
first time ever today. That was why her moral authority had
vanished, why she was floundering around, unable to assert herself
properly. &ldquo;I drank the tea, Egwene.&rdquo; She forced each word
deliberately. She had to force them. &ldquo;The Macura woman&rsquo;s forkroot
tea. She and Luci hauled us upstairs like sacks of feathers. That
is about how much strength we had between us. If Thom and Juilin
hadn&rsquo;t come to pull us out by the scruffs of our necks, we would
probably be there still. Or else on our way to the Tower, so full
of forkroot we wouldn&rsquo;t wake up until we got here.&rdquo; Taking a deep
breath, she tried for a tone of righteous firmness, but it was
difficult when you had just confessed to having been an utter fool.
What came out sounded much more tentative than she liked. &ldquo;If you
tell the Wise Ones about this&mdash;especially that Melaine&mdash;I&rsquo;ll box your ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something in that should have sparked Egwene&rsquo;s ire.
It seemed odd to want to start a row&mdash;usually their quarrels
were over Egwene refusing to see reason, and they seldom ended
pleasantly, since the girl had formed the habit of continuing to
refuse&mdash;but that was certainly better than this. Yet Egwene
only smiled at her. An amused smile. A <em>condescending</em>
amused smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I more than suspected as much, Nynaeve. You used to
drone on about herbs day and night, but you never mentioned any
plant called forkroot. I was sure you&rsquo;d never heard of it until
that woman mentioned it. You&rsquo;ve always tried to put the best face
on things. If you fell head first into a pigsty, you&rsquo;d try to
convince everybody you did it on purpose. Now, what we have to
decide&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do no such thing,&rdquo; Nynaeve spluttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You certainly do. Facts are facts. You might as well
stop whining about it and help me decide&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whining! This was not going at all the way she
wanted. &ldquo;They are no such thing. Not facts, I mean. I have never
done what you said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Egwene stared at her silently. &ldquo;You will
not let go of this, will you? Very well. You lied to me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not a lie,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;Not exactly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other woman ignored her interruption. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;And
you lie to yourself. Do you remember what you made me drink the
last time I lied to you?&rdquo; Suddenly a cup was in her hand, full of
viscous sickly green liquid; it looked as if it had been scooped
from a scummy stagnant pond. &ldquo;The <em>only</em> time I ever lied to
you. The memory of that taste was an effective discouragement. If
you cannot tell the truth even to yourself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve took a step back before she could stop
herself. Boiled catfern and powdered mavinsleaf; her tongue writhed
at just the thought. &ldquo;I did not <em>really</em> lie, actually.&rdquo; Why
was she making excuses? &ldquo;I just didn&rsquo;t tell the whole truth.&rdquo; <em>I
am the Wisdom! I was the Wisdom; that ought to count for something
still</em>. &ldquo;You cannot really think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; <em>Just tell her.
You&rsquo;re not the child here, and you certainly are not going to
drink</em>. &ldquo;Egwene, I&mdash;&rdquo; Egwene pushed the cup nearly under
her nose; she could smell the acrid tang. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she said
hastily. <em>This can&rsquo;t be happening!</em> But she could not take
her eyes off that brimming cup, and she could not stop the words
tumbling out. &ldquo;Sometimes I try to make things look better for
myself than they were. Sometimes. But never anything important.
I&rsquo;ve never&mdash;lied&mdash;about anything important. Never, I
swear. Only small things.&rdquo; The cup vanished, and Nynaeve heaved a
sigh of relief. <em>Fool, fool woman! She couldn&rsquo;t have made you
drink it! What is wrong with you?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;What we have to decide,&rdquo; Egwene said as if nothing
at all had happened, &ldquo;is who to tell. Moiraine certainly has to
know, and Rand, but if everyone hears of it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The Aiel are
peculiar, about Aes Sedai no less than anything else. I think
they&rsquo;ll follow Rand as He Who Comes With the Dawn in spite of
anything, but once they learn the White Tower is against him, maybe
they won&rsquo;t be so fervent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll learn sooner or later,&rdquo; Nynaeve muttered.
<em>She could</em> not <em>have made me drink it!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Later better than sooner, Nynaeve. So don&rsquo;t you go
bursting out in a temper and telling the Wise Ones about this at
our next meeting. In fact, it would be best if you didn&rsquo;t mention
this visit to the Tower at all. That way maybe you can keep it
secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a fool,&rdquo; Nynaeve said stiffly, and felt a
slow burn when Egwene quirked that eyebrow at her again. She was
not about to bring the visit up with the Wise Ones. Not because it
was easier defying them behind their backs. Nothing like that. And
she was not trying to put a good face on things. It was not fair
that Egwene could leap about <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> however she
wanted, while she had to put up with lectures and bullying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you are not,&rdquo; Egwene said. &ldquo;Unless you let
your temper get the better of you. You need to hold your temper and
keep your wits about you if you&rsquo;re right about the Forsaken,
especially Moghedien.&rdquo; Nynaeve glowered at her, opening her mouth
to say that she could too keep her temper and she would smack
Egwene&rsquo;s ears if she thought differently, but the other woman gave
her no chance. &ldquo;We must find that gathering of Blue sisters,
Nynaeve. If they oppose Elaida, maybe&mdash;just maybe&mdash;they
will support Rand the way Siuan did. Was a town mentioned, or a
village? A country, even?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I cannot remember.&rdquo; She struggled to
take the defensive note out of her voice. <em>Light, I confessed
everything, made a fool of myself and it&rsquo;s only made things
worse!</em> &ldquo;I will keep trying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. We must find them, Nynaeve.&rdquo; For a moment
Egwene studied her, while she refused to repeat herself. &ldquo;Nynaeve,
take care concerning Moghedien. Do not go rushing off like a bear
in spring just because she got away from you in Tanchico.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a fool, Egwene,&rdquo; Nynaeve said carefully. It
was frustrating having to hold her temper, but if all Egwene would
do was ignore it or scold her, there was nothing to be gained
beyond looking a bigger ninnyhead than she did already.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know. You said that. Just be sure you remember it.
Be careful.&rdquo; Egwene did not fade away this time; she vanished, as
suddenly as Birgitte.</p>

<p>Nynaeve stared at the spot where she had been,
running through her head all the things she should have said.
Finally she realized that she could stand there all night; she was
repeating herself, and the time for saying anything was past.
Grumbling under her breath, she stepped out of
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, back to her bed in Sienda.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Egwene&rsquo;s eyes popped open in near total darkness,
broken only by a little moonlight streaming in through the smoke
hole. She was glad to be under a pile of blankets; the fire was
out, and freezing cold filled the tent. Her breath turned to mist
in front of her face. Without raising her head, she scanned the
interior. No Wise Ones. She was still alone.</p>

<p>That was her biggest fear on these solitary
excursions into <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>: returning to find Amys or
one of the others waiting for her. Well, maybe not her biggest fear&mdash;the dangers in the World of Dreams were every bit as great
as she had told Nynaeve&mdash;but a big one nonetheless. It was
not punishment that frightened her, not the sort that Bair doled
out. Had she wakened to find a Wise One staring at her, she would
have accepted such gladly, but Amys had told her near the beginning
that if she entered <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> without one of them
accompanying her, they would send her away, refuse to teach her any
longer. That made her quail far more than anything else they could
do. But even so, she had to push ahead. As rapidly as they taught,
they were not rapid enough. She wanted to know now, to know
everything.</p>

<p>Channeling, she lit her lamp and put flames in the
firepit; nothing remained for them to burn, but she tied the weave
off. She lay there, watching her breath mist in front of her mouth,
and waited for warmth enough to dress. It was late, but perhaps
Moiraine would still be awake.</p>

<p>What had happened with Nynaeve still amazed her.
<em>I think she&rsquo;d actually have drunk, if I had pressed her</em>.
She had been so afraid that Nynaeve would learn that she certainly
did not have the Wise Ones&rsquo; permission to jaunt about in the World
of Dreams alone, so sure that the flush of embarrassment had given
her away, that all she could think of was keeping Nynaeve from
speaking, keeping her from winkling out the truth. And she had been
so sure that Nynaeve would find out anyway&mdash;the woman was
quite capable of turning her in and saying it was for her own good&mdash;that all she could do was talk, try to keep the focus on
whatever Nynaeve was doing wrong. No matter how angry Nynaeve made
her, she could not seem to bring up a shout. And with all of that,
somehow, she had gained the upper hand.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, Moiraine seldom raised her
voice, and when she did she was least effective in having what she
wanted done. It had been so even before she began behaving so
strangely with Rand. The Wise Ones never yelled at anyone, either&mdash;except each other, sometimes&mdash;and for all their
grumping about the chiefs no longer listening, they still seemed to
get their way much more often than not. There was an old saying
that she had never really understood before: &ldquo;He strains to hear a
whisper who refuses to hear a shout.&rdquo; She would not shout at Rand
again. A quiet, firm, womanly voice, that was the thing. For that
matter, she ought not to shout at Nynaeve, either; she was a woman,
not a girl throwing tantrums.</p>

<p>She found herself giggling. She especially ought not
to raise her voice with Nynaeve when speaking calmly produced such
results.</p>

<p>The tent finally seemed warm enough, and she
scampered out, dressing quickly. She still had to break ice in her
water pitcher before she could wash the sleep out of her mouth.
Tossing the dark woolen cloak about her shoulders, she untied the
strands of Fire&mdash;Fire by itself was dangerous to leave tied&mdash;and as the flames vanished, ducked out of the tent. Cold
closed on her like an icy vise as she hurried through the camp.</p>

<p>Only the nearest tents were really visible to her,
low, shadowed shapes that could have been part of the rugged earth,
save that the camp extended for miles into the mountainous land to
either side. These tall jagged peaks were not the Spine of the
World; that was much higher, and lay days to the west yet.</p>

<p>She approached Rand&rsquo;s tent hesitantly. A sliver of
light showed along the tent flap. A Maiden seemed to rise out of
the ground as she came closer, horn bow on her back, quiver at her
waist and spears and buckler in hand. Egwene could not make out any
others in the darkness, but she knew they were there, even here
surrounded by six clans all claiming loyalty to the
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>. The Miagoma were somewhere to the north,
paralleling their march; Timolan would not say what his intentions
were. Where the other clans were, Rand did not seem to care. His
attention was all on the race for Jangai Pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he awake, Enaila?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>Moonshadows shifted on the Maiden&rsquo;s face as she
nodded. &ldquo;He does not sleep enough. A man cannot go without rest.&rdquo;
She sounded for all the world like a mother fretting over her
son.</p>

<p>A shadow beside the tent stirred, became Aviendha
with her shawl wrapped around her. She did not seem to feel the
cool, only the hour. &ldquo;I would sing him a lullaby, if I thought it
might work. I have heard of women being kept awake all night by an
infant, but a grown man should know that others would like to have
their blankets.&rdquo; She and Enaila shared a quiet chuckle.</p>

<p>Shaking her head over Aiel strangeness, Egwene bent
to peer through the crack. Several lamps lit the interior. He was
not alone. Natael&rsquo;s dark eyes looked haggard, and he stifled a
yawn. He at least wanted sleep. Rand lay sprawled close by one of
the gilded oil lamps, reading a battered leather-bound book. One
translation or another of the Prophecies of the Dragon, if she knew
him at all.</p>

<p>Abruptly he flipped back through the pages, read,
then laughed. She tried to tell herself there was nothing of
madness in that laugh, only bitterness. &ldquo;A fine joke,&rdquo; he told
Natael, snapping the book shut and tossing it to him. &ldquo;Read page
two hundred eighty-seven and page four hundred, and tell me if you
don&rsquo;t agree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s mouth tightened as she straightened. He
really should be more careful with a book. She could not speak to
him, not in front of the gleeman. It was a shame that he had to use
a man he barely knew for company. No. He had Aviendha, and the
chiefs often enough, and Lan every day, and Mat sometimes. &ldquo;Why
don&rsquo;t you join them, Aviendha? If you were there, maybe he&rsquo;d want
to talk of something besides that book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wanted to talk with the gleeman, Egwene, and he
seldom does that in front of me or anyone. Had I not left, he and
Natael would have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Children are a great worry, I have heard.&rdquo; Enaila
laughed. &ldquo;And sons the worst. You may find out the truth of this
for me, now that you have given up the spear.&rdquo; Aviendha gave her a
moonlit frown and stalked back to her place against the side of the
tent like an offended cat. Enaila seemed to think that funny, too;
she clutched her sides laughing.</p>

<p>Muttering to herself about Aiel humor&mdash;she
almost never understood it&mdash;Egwene made her way to Moiraine&rsquo;s
tent, not far from Rand&rsquo;s. Here, too, there was a sliver of light,
and she knew that the Aes Sedai was awake. Moiraine was channeling;
only tiny amounts of the Power, but still enough for Egwene to
sense. Lan lay sleeping nearby, wrapped in his Warder&rsquo;s cloak;
except for his head and boots, the rest of him seemed part of the
night. Gathering her cloak, she held her skirts up and tiptoed so
as not to wake him.</p>

<p>His breathing did not change, but something made her
look at him again. Moonlight glinted on his eyes, open and watching
her. Even as she turned her head, they closed again. Not another
muscle stirred; he might never have wakened at all. Sometimes the
man unnerved her. Whatever Nynaeve saw in him, she could not
see.</p>

<p>Kneeling beside the tent flap, she peered in.
Moiraine sat surrounded by the glow of <em>saidar</em>, the small
blue stone that usually hung on her forehead dangling from her
fingers in front of her face. It shone, adding a bit to the light
of a single lamp. The firepit held only ashes; even the smell was
gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had to repeat herself before Moiraine answered.
&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; The light of <em>saidar</em> faded away, and the Aes
Sedai began fastening the fine golden chain back into her hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were eavesdropping on Rand?&rdquo; Egwene settled
herself beside the other woman. It was as cold in the tent as it
was outside. She channeled flames atop the ashes in the firepit and
tied the flow. &ldquo;You said you would not do it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said that since the Wise Ones could watch his
dreams, we should allow him some privacy. They have not asked again
since he shut them out, and I have not offered. Remember that they
have their own goals, which may not be those of the Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As quickly as that, they had come to it. Egwene was
still not sure how to tell what she knew without betraying herself
to the Wise Ones, but perhaps the only method was to just tell it
and then feel her way. &ldquo;Elaida is Amyrlin, Moiraine. I do not know
what has happened to Siuan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; Moiraine said quietly. &ldquo;Did you
learn something dreamwalking? Or has your Talent as a Dreamer
finally manifested itself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was her way out. Some of the Aes Sedai in the
Tower thought that she might be a Dreamer, a woman whose dreams
foretold the future. She did have dreams that she knew were
significant, but learning to interpret them was another matter. The
Wise Ones said the knowledge had to come from within, and none of
the Aes Sedai had been any more help. Rand sitting down in a chair,
and somehow she knew that the chair&rsquo;s owner would be murderously
angry at having her chair taken; that the owner was a woman was as
much as she could pick out of that, and not a thing more. Sometimes
the dreams were complex. Perrin, lounging with Faile on his lap,
kissing her while she played with the short-cut beard that he wore
in the dream. Behind them two banners waved, a red wolf&rsquo;s head and
a crimson eagle. A man in a bright yellow coat stood near to
Perrin&rsquo;s shoulder, a sword strapped to his back; in some way she
knew that he was a Tinker, though no Tinker would even touch a
sword. And every bit of it except the beard seemed important: the
banners, Faile kissing Perrin, even the Tinker. Every time he moved
closer to Perrin it was as if a chill of doom shot through
everything. Another dream. Mat throwing dice with blood streaming
down his face, the wide brim of his hat pulled low so she could not
see his wound, while Thom Merrilin put his hand into a fire to
draw out the small blue stone that now dangled on Moiraine&rsquo;s
forehead. Or a dream of a storm, great dark clouds rolling without
wind or rain while forked lightning bolts, every one identical,
rent the earth. She had the dreams, but as a Dreamer she was a
failure so far.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw an arrest warrant for you, Moiraine, signed by
Elaida as Amyrlin. And it was no ordinary dream.&rdquo; All true. Just
not all of the truth. She was suddenly glad that Nynaeve was not
there. <em>I&rsquo;d be the one staring at a cup, if she was</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills. Perhaps it will
not matter so much if Rand takes the Aiel across the Dragonwall. I
doubt that Elaida has continued to approach rulers, even if she
knows that Siuan was doing so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all you can say? I think Siuan was your
friend once, Moiraine. Can&rsquo;t you shed a tear for her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai looked at her, and that cool, serene
gaze told her how far she had to go before she could use that title
herself. Sitting, Egwene was nearly a head taller, and she was
stronger in the Power besides, but there was more to being Aes
Sedai than strength. &ldquo;I have no time for tears, Egwene. The
Dragonwall is not many days distant now, and the Alguenya&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Siuan and I were friends, once. In a few months it will be
twenty-one years since we began the search for the Dragon Reborn.
Only the two of us, newly raised Aes Sedai. Sierin Vayu was raised
Amyrlin shortly after, a Gray with more than a touch of Red in her.
Had she learned what we intended, we would have spent the rest of
our lives doing penance with Red sisters watching us even while we
slept. There is a saying in Cairhien, though I have heard it as far
away as Tarabon and Saldaea. &lsquo;Take what you want, and pay for it.&rsquo;
Siuan and I took the path we wanted, and we knew we would have to
pay for it eventually.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not see how you can be so calm. Siuan could be
dead, or even stilled. Elaida will either oppose Rand altogether or
try to hold him somewhere until Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don; you know she&rsquo;ll
never let a man who can channel run free. At least not everyone is
behind Elaida. Some of the Blue Ajah are gathering somewhere&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know where yet&mdash;and I think others have left the
Tower, too. Nynaeve said that she was given a message about all
sisters being welcome to return to the Tower by an eyes-and-ears of
the Yellow. If Blues and Yellows have both gone, others must have.
And if they oppose Elaida, they may support Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine sighed, a soft sound. &ldquo;Do you expect me to
be happy that the White Tower has split apart? I am Aes Sedai,
Egwene. I gave my life to the Tower long before I ever suspected
the Dragon would be Reborn in my lifetime. The Tower has been a
bulwark against the Shadow for three thousand years. It has guided
rulers to wise decisions, stopped wars before they began, halted
wars that did begin. That humankind even remembers that the Dark
One waits to escape, that the Last Battle will come, is because of
the Tower. The Tower, whole and united. I could almost wish that
every sister had sworn to Elaida, whatever happened to Siuan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Rand?&rdquo; Egwene kept her voice just as steady,
just as smooth. The flames were beginning to put a little warmth
into the air, but Moiraine had just added her own chill. &ldquo;The
Dragon Reborn. You yourself said that he cannot be ready for Tarmon
Gai&rsquo;don unless he is allowed his freedom, both to learn and to
affect the world. The Tower united could take him prisoner despite
all the Aiel in the Waste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine smiled a small smile. &ldquo;You learn. Cool
reason is always better than hot words. But you forget that only
thirteen sisters linked can shield any man from <em>saidin</em>,
and even if they do not know the trick of tying flows, fewer can
hold that shield.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you are not giving up, Moiraine. What do you
mean to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to deal with the world as I find the world,
for as long as I can. At least Rand will be&mdash;easier to be
around&mdash;now that I no longer need try to turn him from what
he wants. I suppose I should be happy that he does not make me
fetch his wine. He does listen most of the time, even if he seldom
gives any sign what he thinks of what I tell him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will leave you to tell him about Siuan and the
Tower.&rdquo; That would avoid awkward questions; with Rand as big-headed
as he was, he might want to know more about her Dreaming than she
could invent. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else. Nynaeve has seen Forsaken in
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. She mentioned every last one still alive
except Asmodean and Moghedien. Including Lanfear. She thinks they
are plotting something, perhaps together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lanfear,&rdquo; Moiraine said after a moment.</p>

<p>They both knew that Lanfear had visited Rand in Tear,
and maybe other times that he had not told them of. No one had much
knowledge of the Forsaken except the Forsaken themselves&mdash;only fragments of fragments remained in the Tower&mdash;but it was
known that Lanfear had loved Lews Therin Telamon. They two, and
Rand, knew that she still did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With luck,&rdquo; the Aes Sedai went on, &ldquo;we will not have
to worry about Lanfear. The others Nynaeve saw are another matter.
You and I must keep as close a watch as we can. I wish more of the
Wise Ones could channel.&rdquo; She gave a small laugh. &ldquo;But I might as
well wish they were all Tower trained while I am about it, or to
live forever. They may be strong in many ways, but they are sadly
lacking in others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A watch is all very well, but what else? If six
Forsaken come at him together, he will need every bit of help we
can give him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine leaned over to put a hand on her arm, a look
of affection on her face. &ldquo;We cannot hold his hand forever, Egwene.
He has learned to walk. He is learning to run. We can only hope he
learns before his enemies catch him. And, of course, continue to
advise him. To guide him when we can.&rdquo; Straightening, she
stretched, and stifled a small yawn behind her hand. &ldquo;It is late,
Egwene. And I expect that Rand will have us breaking camp in a very
few hours now, even if he gets no sleep at all. I, however, would
like to take what rest I can before facing my saddle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene made ready to go, but first she had a
question. &ldquo;Moiraine, why have you started doing everything Rand
tells you to? Even Nynaeve doesn&rsquo;t think it is right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She does not, does she?&rdquo; Moiraine murmured. &ldquo;She
will be Aes Sedai yet, whatever she wishes. Why? Because I
remembered how to control <em>saidar</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a moment, Egwene nodded. To control
<em>saidar</em>, first you had to surrender to it.</p>

<p>It was not until she was shivering her way back to
her own tent that she realized Moiraine had spoken to her the whole
time as an equal. Perhaps she was closer to being ready to choose
her Ajah than she thought.</p>
