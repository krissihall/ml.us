 Warder in a gray-green coat approached Bryne as
soon as he rode Traveler past the first stone houses of the
village. Bryne would have known the man for a Warder after watching
him walk two strides, even without all the Aes Sedai faces staring
at him in the street. What in the name of the Light were so many
Aes Sedai doing this close to Amadicia? Rumor in villages behind
said Ailron meant to claim this bank of the River Eldar, which
meant the Whitecloaks did. Aes Sedai could defend themselves well,
but if Niall sent a legion across the Eldar, a good many of these
women would die. Unless he could no longer tell how long a stump
had been exposed to air, this place had been buried in the forest
two months ago. What had Mara gotten herself into? He was sure he
would find her here; village men remembered three pretty young
women traveling together, especially when one of them asked
directions to a town abandoned since the Whitecloak War.</p>

<p>The Warder, a big man with a broad face, an Illianer
by his beard, planted himself in the street in front of Bryne&rsquo;s
big-nosed bay gelding and bowed. &ldquo;Lord Bryne? I am Nuhel Dromand.
If you will come with me, there are those who do wish to speak with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bryne dismounted slowly, pulling off his gauntlets
and tucking them behind his sword belt as he studied the town. The
plain buff-colored coat he wore now was much better for a journey
of this sort than the gray silk he had started in; that, he had
given away. Aes Sedai and Warders, and others, watched him silently,
but even those who had to be servants did not look surprised. And
Dromand knew his name. His face was not unknown, but he suspected
more than that. If Mara was&mdash;if they were Aes Sedai agents,
it did not alter the oath they had taken. &ldquo;Lead on, Nuhel Gaidin.&rdquo;
If Nuhel was surprised at the address, he did not show it.</p>

<p>The inn that Dromand took him to&mdash;or what had
been an inn once&mdash;had the look of headquarters for a
campaign, all bustle and scurry. That is, if Aes Sedai had ever
commanded a campaign. He spotted Serenla before she did him, seated
in the corner with a big man who was very likely Dalyn. When she
did see him, her chin dropped almost to the table, and then she
squinted at him as if not believing her eyes. Dalyn appeared to be
asleep with his eyes open, staring at nothing. None of the Aes
Sedai or Warders seemed to notice as Dromand led him through, but
Bryne would have wagered his manor and lands that any one of them
had seen ten times as much as all the staring servants combined. He
should have turned and ridden away as soon as he realized who was
in this village.</p>

<p>He took careful note as he made his bows while the
Warder introduced him to the six seated Aes Sedai&mdash;only a
fool was careless around Aes Sedai&mdash;but his mind was on the
two young women standing against the wall beside the fresh-swept
fireplace and looking chastened. The willowy Domani minx was
offering him a smile more tremulous than seductive for a change.
Mara was frightened, too&mdash;terrified out of her skin, he would
say&mdash;but those blue eyes still met his full of defiance. The
girl had courage to suit a lion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to greet you, Lord Bryne,&rdquo; the
flame-haired Aes Sedai said. Just slightly plump, and with those
tilted eyes, she was pretty enough to make any man look twice
despite the Great Serpent ring on her finger. &ldquo;Will you tell us
what brings you here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Sheriam Sedai.&rdquo; Nuhel stood at his
shoulder, but if any women needed less guarding from one old
soldier, Bryne could not imagine who. He was sure that they knew
already, and watching their faces while he told the tale confirmed
it. Aes Sedai let nothing be seen that they did not want seen, but
at least one of them would have blinked when he spoke of the oath
if they had not known beforehand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dreadful story to relate, Lord Bryne.&rdquo; That was
the one called Anaiya; ageless face or not, she looked more like a
happy, prosperous farmwife than an Aes Sedai. &ldquo;Yet I am surprised
that you followed so far, even after oathbreakers.&rdquo; Mara&rsquo;s fair
cheeks flushed a furious red. &ldquo;Still, a strong oath, one that
should not be broken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; Sheriam said, &ldquo;we cannot let you
take them quite yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they were Aes Sedai agents. &ldquo;A strong oath that
should not be broken, yet you mean to keep them from honoring
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will honor it,&rdquo; Myrelle said, with a glance at
the pair by the fireplace that made them both stand straighter,
&ldquo;and you may rest assured that they already regret running away
after giving, it.&rdquo; This time it was Amaena who reddened; Mara
looked ready to chew rocks. &ldquo;But we cannot allow it yet.&rdquo; No Ajahs
had been mentioned, yet he thought the darkly pretty woman was
Green, and the stout, round-faced one called Morvrin was Brown.
Perhaps it was the smile that Myrelle had given Dromand when the
man brought him in, and Morvrin&rsquo;s air of thinking of something
else. &ldquo;In truth, they did not say when they would serve, and we
have a use for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was foolish; he should apologize for disturbing
them and leave. And that was foolish, too. He had known before
Dromand reached him in the street that he was unlikely to leave
Salidar alive. There were probably fifty Warders in the forest
around where he had left his men, if not a hundred. Joni and the
others would give a good account of themselves, but he had not
brought them all this way to die. Yet if he was a fool to have let
a pair of eyes lure him into this trap, he might as well go the
last mile for it. &ldquo;Arson, theft and assault, Aes Sedai. Those were
the crimes. They were tried, sentenced, and sworn. But I have no
objection to remaining here until you are done with them. Mara can
act as my dog robber when you do not need her. I will mark the
hours she works for me, and count them against her service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mara opened her mouth angrily, but almost as if the
women had known that she would try to speak, six pairs of Aes Sedai
eyes swiveled to her in unison. She shifted her shoulders, snapped
her mouth shut, and then glared at him; fists rigidly at her sides.
He was glad she did not have a knife in her hand.</p>

<p>Myrelle appeared close to laughter. &ldquo;Better to choose
the other, Lord Bryne. From the way she is looking at you, you
would find her far more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;congenial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He half-expected Amaena to go crimson, but she did
not. And she was eyeing him&mdash;appraisingly. She even shared a
smile with Myrelle. Well, she was Domani after all, and
considerably more so than when he saw her last, it seemed.</p>

<p>Carlinya, cold enough to make the others seem warm,
leaned forward. He was wary of her, and of the big-eyed one named
Beonin. He was not sure why. Except that if he were in the Game of
Houses here, he would say both women reeked of ambition. Maybe he
was involved in exactly that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should be aware,&rdquo; Carlinya said coolly, &ldquo;that
the woman you know as Mara is in reality Siuan Sanche, formerly the
Amyrlin Seat. Amaena is really Leane Sharif, who was Keeper of the
Chronicles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was all he could do not to gape like a country
lout. Now that he knew, he could see it in Mara&rsquo;s face&mdash;in
Siuan&rsquo;s&mdash;the face that had made him back down, softened into
youth. &ldquo;How?&rdquo; was all he said. It was almost all he could have
managed to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are some things men are better off not
knowing,&rdquo; Sheriam replied coolly, &ldquo;and most women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mara&mdash;no, he might as well think of her by her
right name&mdash;Siuan had been stilled. He knew that. It must be
something to do with stilling. If that swan-necked Domani had been
Keeper, he was ready to wager she had been stilled, too. But
talking about stilling around Aes Sedai was a good way to find out
how tough you were. Besides, when they began going mysterious with
you, Aes Sedai would not give a straight answer if you asked
whether the sky was blue.</p>

<p>They were very good, these Aes Sedai. They had lulled
him, then hit hard when his guard was down. He had a sinking
feeling that he knew what they were softening him for. It would be
interesting to learn whether he was right. &ldquo;It does not change the
oath they took. If they were still Amyrlin and Keeper, they could
be held to that oath by any law, including that of Tar Valon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you have no objection to remaining here,&rdquo;
Sheriam said, &ldquo;you may have Siuan as your body-servant, when we do
not need her. You may have all three of them, if you wish,
including Min, whom you apparently know as Serenla, all the time.&rdquo;
For some reason, that seemed to irritate Siuan as much as what had
been said about her; she muttered to herself, not loud enough to be
heard. &ldquo;And since you have no objections, Lord Bryne, while you
remain with us there is a service that you can give us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gratitude of Aes Sedai is not inconsiderable,&rdquo;
Morvrin said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be serving the Light and justice in serving
us,&rdquo; Carlinya added.</p>

<p>Beonin nodded, speaking in serious tones. &ldquo;You served
Morgase and Andor faithfully. Serve us as well, and you will not
find exile at its end. Nothing we ask of you will go against your
honor. Nothing we ask will harm Andor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bryne grimaced. He was in the Game, all right. He
sometimes thought that Aes Sedai must have invented <em>Daes
Dae&rsquo;mar</em>, they seemed to play it in their sleep. Battle was
surely more bloody, but it was more honest, too. If they meant to
pull his strings, then his strings would be pulled&mdash;they
would manage it one way or another&mdash;but it was time to show
them he was not a brainless puppet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The White Tower is broken,&rdquo; he said flatly. Those
Aes Sedai eyes widened, but he gave them no chance to speak. &ldquo;The
Ajahs have split. That is the only reason you can all be here. You
certainly don&rsquo;t need an extra sword or two&rdquo;&mdash;he eyed Dromand
and got a nod in return&mdash;&ldquo;so the only service you can want out
of me is to lead an army. To build one, first, unless you have
other camps with a good many more men than I saw here. And that
means you intend to oppose Elaida.&rdquo; Sheriam looked vexed, Anaiya
worried, and Carlinya on the point of speaking, but he went on. Let
them listen; he expected he would be doing a great deal of
listening to them in the months to come. &ldquo;Very well. I&rsquo;ve never
liked Elaida, and I cannot believe she makes a good Amyrlin. More
importantly, I can make an army to take Tar Valon. So long as you
know the taking will be bloody and long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But these are my conditions.&rdquo; They stiffened to a
woman at that, even Siuan and Leane. Men did not make conditions
for Aes Sedai. &ldquo;First, the command is mine. You tell me what to do,
but I decide how. You give commands to me, and I give them to the
soldiers under me, not you. Not unless I have agreed to it first.&rdquo;
Several mouths opened, Carlinya&rsquo;s and Beonin&rsquo;s first, but he
continued. &ldquo;I assign men, I promote them, and I discipline them.
Not you. Second, if I tell you it can&rsquo;t be done, you will consider
what I say. I don&rsquo;t ask to usurp your authority&rdquo;&mdash;small
chance they would allow that&mdash;&ldquo;yet do not want to waste men
because you do not understand war.&rdquo; It would happen, but no more
than once, if he was lucky. &ldquo;Third, if you begin this, you will
stay the course. I will be putting my head in a noose, and every
man who follows along with me, and should you decide half a year
from now that Elaida as Amyrlin is preferable to war, you will pull
that noose tight for every one of us who can be hunted down. The
nations may stay out of a civil war in the Tower, but they&rsquo;ll not
let us live if you abandon us. Elaida will see to that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will not agree to these, then I do not know
that I can serve you. Whether you bind me with the Power for
Dromand here to slit my throat or I end attainted and hung, death
is still the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai did not speak. For a long moment they
stared at him, until the itch between his shoulder blades made him
wonder if Nuhel was ready to plunge a dagger in. Then Sheriam rose,
and the others followed her to the windows. He could see their lips
moving, but he heard nothing. If they wanted to hide their
deliberations behind the One Power, so be it. He was not certain
how much of what he wanted he could wring out of them. All, if they
were sensible, but Aes Sedai could decide that strange things were
sensible. Whatever they decided, he would have to accede with as
good a grace as he could muster. It was a perfect trap that he had
made for himself.</p>

<p>Leane gave him a look and a smile that said as plain
as words that he would never know what he had missed; he thought it
would have been a fine chase, with him being led by the nose.
Domani women never promised half what you thought they did, and
they gave only as much as they chose and changed their minds either
way in a blink.</p>

<p>The bait in his trap stared at him levelly, strode
across the floor until she stood so close that she had to crane her
neck to stare up at him, and spoke in a low, furious voice. &ldquo;Why
did you do this? Why did you follow us? For a barn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For an oath.&rdquo; For a pair of blue eyes. Siuan Sanche
could not be more than ten years younger than he, but it was hard
to remember that she was Siuan Sanche while looking at a face
nearer thirty years younger. The eyes were the same, though, deep
blue and strong. &ldquo;An oath you gave to me, and broke. I should
double your time for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dropping her gaze from his, she folded her arms
beneath her breasts, growling, &ldquo;That has already been taken care
of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean they punished you for oathbreaking? If
you&rsquo;ve had your bottom switched for it, it doesn&rsquo;t count unless I
do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dromand&rsquo;s chuckle sounded more than half scandalized&mdash;the man had to be still struggling with who Siuan had been;
Bryne was not certain that he was not, too&mdash;and her face
darkened until he thought she might have apoplexy. &ldquo;My time has
already been doubled, if not more, you pile of rancid fish guts!
You and your marking hours! Not an hour will count until you have
all three of us back at your manor, not if I must be your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>dog robber</em>, whatever that is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;for twenty
years!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they had planned for this too, Sheriam and the
others. He glanced to their conference by the windows. They seemed
to have divided into two opposing groups; Sheriam, Anaiya and
Myrelle on one side, Morvrin and Carlinya on the other, with Beonin
standing between. They had been ready to give him Siuan and Leane
and&mdash;Min?&mdash;as bribe or sop, before he ever walked in.
They were desperate, which meant he was on the weaker side, but
maybe they were desperate enough to give him what he needed for a
chance of victory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are taking pleasure from this, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
Siuan said fiercely the moment his eyes moved. &ldquo;You buzzard. Burn
you for a carp-brained fool. Now that you know who I am, it pleases
you that I&rsquo;ll have to bow and scrape to you.&rdquo; She did not seem to
be doing much of that yet. &ldquo;Why? Is it because I made you back down
over Murandy? Are you so small, Gareth Bryne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was trying to make him angry; she realized that
she had said too much, and did not want to give him time to think
on it. Maybe she was no longer Aes Sedai, but manipulation was in
her blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were the Amyrlin Seat,&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;and
even a king kisses the Amyrlin&rsquo;s ring. I can&rsquo;t say that I liked how
you went about it, and we may have a quiet talk sometime on whether
it was necessary to do what you did with half the court looking on,
but you will remember that I followed Mara Tomanes here, and it was
Mara Tomanes I asked for. Not Siuan Sanche. Since you keep asking
why, let me ask it. Why was it so important for me to allow the
Murandians to raid across the border?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because your interference then could have ruined
important plans,&rdquo; she said, driving each word home in a tight
voice, &ldquo;just as your interference with me now can. The Tower had
identified a young border lord named Dulain as a man who could one
day truly unify Murandy, with our help. I could hardly allow the
chance your soldiers might kill him. I have work to do here, <em>
Lord</em> Bryne. Leave me to do it, and you may see victory. Meddle
out of spite, and you ruin everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever your work is, I am sure Sheriam and the
others will see you do it. Dulain? I&rsquo;ve never heard of him. He
cannot be succeeding yet.&rdquo; It was his opinion that Murandy would
remain a patchwork of all but independent lords and ladies until
the Wheel turned and a new Age came. Murandians called themselves
Lugarders or Mindeans or whatever before they named a nation. If
they even bothered to name one. A lord who could unite them, and
who had Siuan&rsquo;s leash around his throat, could bring a considerable
number of men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;died.&rdquo; Scarlet spots appeared in her
cheeks, and she seemed to struggle with herself. &ldquo;A month after I
left Caemlyn,&rdquo; she muttered, &ldquo;some Andoran farmer put an arrow
through him on a sheep raid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could not help laughing. &ldquo;It was the farmers you
should have made kneel, not me. Well, you no longer need concern
yourself with such things.&rdquo; That was certainly true. Whatever use
the Aes Sedai had for her, they would never let her near power or
decisions again now. He felt pity for her. He could not imagine
this woman giving up and dying, but she had lost about as much as
it was possible to lose short of dying. On the other hand, he had
not liked being called a buzzard, or a pile of reeking fish guts.
What was the other thing? A carp-brained fool. &ldquo;From now on, you
can concern yourself with keeping my boots clean and my bed
made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes narrowed to slits. &ldquo;If that is what you
want, <em>Lord</em> Gareth Bryne, you should choose Leane. <em>
She</em> might be fool enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only barely did he stop himself from goggling. The
way women&rsquo;s minds worked never ceased to amaze him. &ldquo;You vowed to
serve me however I choose.&rdquo; He managed to chuckle. Why was he doing
this? He knew who she was, and what she was. But those eyes still
haunted him, staring a challenge even when she thought there was no
hope, just as they were now. &ldquo;You will discover the kind of man I
am, Siuan.&rdquo; He meant it to soothe her after his jest, but from the
way her shoulders stiffened, she seemed to take it as a threat.</p>

<p>Suddenly he realized that he could hear the Aes
Sedai, a soft murmur of voices that went silent immediately. They
stood together, staring at him with unreadable expressions. No, at
Siuan. Their eyes followed her as she started back to where Leane
still stood; as if she could feel the pressure of them, each step
came a little quicker than the one before. When she turned again,
beside the fireplace, her face told no more than theirs. A
remarkable woman. He was not sure he could have done as well, in
her place.</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai were waiting for him to approach. When
he did, Sheriam said, &ldquo;We accept your conditions without
reservation, Lord Bryne, and pledge ourselves to hold to them. They
are most reasonable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carlinya, at least, did not look as though she
thought they were reasonable at all, but he did not care. He had
been prepared to give up all but the last, that they stay the
course, if need be.</p>

<p>He knelt where he was, right fist pressed to the
scrap of carpet, and they encircled him, each laying a hand on his
bowed head. He did not care whether they used the Power to bind him
to his oath or search for truth&mdash;he was not sure they could
do either, but who really knew what Aes Sedai could do?&mdash;and
if they meant something else, there was nothing he could do about
it. Trapped by a pair of eyes, like a bull-goose fool country boy.
He <em>was</em> carp-brained. &ldquo;I do pledge and vow that I will
serve you faithfully until the White Tower is yours&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Already, he was planning. Thad and maybe a Warder or
two across the river to see what the Whitecloaks were up to. Joni,
Barim and a few others down to Ebou Dar; it would keep Joni from
swallowing his tongue every time he looked at &ldquo;Mara&rdquo; and &ldquo;Amaena,&rdquo;
and every man he sent would know how to recruit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;building and directing your army, to the best
of my ability&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">When the low buzz of talk in the common room died,
Min looked up from the patterns she had been idly sketching on the
table with a finger dipped in wine. Logain stirred, too, for a
wonder, but only to stare at the people in the room, or maybe
through them; it was hard to tell.</p>

<p>Gareth Bryne and that big Illianer Warder came out of
the back room first. In the watchful silence, she heard Bryne say,
&ldquo;Tell them an Ebou Dari tavern maid sent you, or they&rsquo;ll put your
head on a stake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Illianer roared with laughter. &ldquo;A dangerous city,
Ebou Dar.&rdquo; Pulling leather gauntlets from behind his sword belt, he
stalked out into the street drawing them on.</p>

<p>The talk began to pick up again as Siuan appeared.
Min could not hear what Bryne said to her, but she strode after the
Warder snarling to herself. Min had a sinking feeling that the Aes
Sedai had decided that they were going to honor that fool oath
Siuan had been so proud of, honor it right now. If she could
convince herself that the pair of Warders lounging against the wall
would not notice, she would be out of the door and into Wildrose&rsquo;s
saddle in a flash.</p>

<p>Sheriam and the other Aes Sedai came out last, with
Leane. Myrelle sat Leane down at one of the tables and began
discussing something, while the rest circulated through the room,
stopping to speak to each Aes Sedai. Whatever they said, it
produced reactions from outright shock to pleased grins, despite
that fabled Aes Sedai serenity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay here,&rdquo; Min told Logain, scraping back her
rickety chair. She hoped he was not going to start trouble. He was
staring at Aes Sedai faces, one by one, and appearing to see more
than he had in days. &ldquo;Just stay at this table till I get back,
Dalyn.&rdquo; She was out of the habit of being around people who knew
his real name. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She sold me to Aes Sedai.&rdquo; It was a shock to hear
him speak after being so long silent. He shivered, then nodded. &ldquo;I
will wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min hesitated, but if two Warders could not stop him
from doing anything stupid, a roomful of Aes Sedai certainly could.
When she reached the door, a chunky bay gelding was being led away
by a man with the look of a groom. Bryne&rsquo;s horse, she supposed.
Their own mounts were nowhere in sight. So much for any dash for
freedom. <em>I&rsquo;ll honor the bloody thing! I will! But they can&rsquo;t
keep me from Rand now. I&rsquo;ve done what Siuan wanted. They have to
let me go to him</em>. The only problem was that Aes Sedai decided
for themselves what they had to do, and usually what other people
had to do as well.</p>

<p>Siuan nearly knocked her down, bustling back in with
a scowl on her face, a blanket roll under her arm and saddlebags
over her shoulder. &ldquo;Watch Logain,&rdquo; she hissed under her breath
without slowing. &ldquo;Let no one talk to him.&rdquo; She marched to the foot
of the stairs, where a gray-haired woman, a servant, was starting
to lead Bryne up, and fell in behind. From the stare she fixed on
the man&rsquo;s back, he should have been praying she did not reach for
her belt knife.</p>

<p>Min smiled at the tall, slender Warder who had
followed her to the door. He stood ten feet away, barely glancing
at her, but she had no illusions. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re guests now. Friends.&rdquo; He
did not return the smile. <em>Bloody stone-faced men!</em> Why
could they not at least give you a hint what they were
thinking?</p>

<p>Logain was still studying the Aes Sedai when she got
back to the table. A fine time for Siuan to want him kept silent,
just when he was beginning to show life again. She needed to talk
to Siuan. &ldquo;Logain,&rdquo; she said softly, hoping neither of the Warders
lounging against the wall could hear. They had hardly seemed to
breathe since taking their positions, except when one had followed
her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you should say anything until Mara tells you
what she has planned. Not to anyone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mara?&rdquo; He gave her a dark sneer. &ldquo;You mean Siuan
Sanche?&rdquo; So he remembered what he had heard in his daze. &ldquo;Does
anyone here look as if they want to talk to me?&rdquo; He returned to his
frowning study.</p>

<p>No one did look as if they wanted to talk with a
gentled false Dragon. Except for the two Warders, no one seemed to
be paying them any mind at all. If she had not known better, she
would have said the Aes Sedai in the room were excited. They had
hardly appeared lethargic before, but they certainly seemed to have
more energy now, talking in small groups, issuing brisk orders to
Warders. The papers they had been so intent on largely lay
abandoned. Sheriam and the others who had taken Siuan away had
returned to the room at the back, but Leane had two clerks at her
table now, both women writing as fast as they could. And a steady
stream of Aes Sedai were coming into the inn, disappearing through
that rough plank door and not coming out; Whatever had happened in
there, Siuan had surely stirred them up.</p>

<p>Min wished she had Siuan at the table, or better yet
somewhere alone, for five minutes. Doubtless at that moment she was
beating Bryne over the head with his saddlebags. No, Siuan would
not resort to that, for all of her glares. Bryne was not like
Logain, larger than life in every dimension, every emotion; Logain
had managed to overpower Siuan for a time with sheer hugeness.
Bryne was quiet, reserved, not a small man certainly, but hardly
overbearing. She would not want the man she remembered from Kore
Springs as an enemy, but she did not think that he would hold out
long against Siuan. He might think she was going to meekly serve
out her time as his servant, but Min had no doubts who would end
doing what who wanted. She just had to talk to the woman about
him.</p>

<p>As if Min&rsquo;s thoughts had brought her, Siuan came
stumping down the stairs, a bundle of white under her arm. Stalked
down was nearer truth; if she had had a tail, she would have been
lashing it. She paused for one instant, staring at Min and Logain,
then marched toward the door that led to the kitchens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay here,&rdquo; Min cautioned Logain. &ldquo;And please, say
nothing until&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Siuan can talk to you.&rdquo; She was going to have
to get used to calling people by their right names again. He did
not even look at her.</p>

<p>She caught up with Siuan in a hallway short of the
kitchen; the rattle and splash of pots being scrubbed and dishes
washed drifted through gaps where boards had dried in the kitchen
door.</p>

<p>Siuan&rsquo;s eyes widened in alarm. &ldquo;Why did you leave
him? Is he still alive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll live forever, for all I can see. Siuan, no one
<em>wants</em> to talk to him. But I have to talk with you.&rdquo; Siuan
stuffed the white bundle into her arms. Shirts. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gareth bloody Bryne&rsquo;s bloody laundry,&rdquo; the other
woman snarled. &ldquo;Since you are one of his <em>serving girls</em>
too, you can wash them. I must speak with Logain before anyone
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min caught her arm as she tried to brush past. &ldquo;You
can spare one minute to listen. When Bryne came in, I had a
viewing. An aura, and a bull ripping roses from around its neck,
and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;None of it matters except the aura. I didn&rsquo;t even really
understand that, but more than anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much did you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you want to stay alive, you had better stay close
to him.&rdquo; Despite the heat, Min shivered. She had only ever had one
other viewing with an &ldquo;if&rdquo; in it, and both had been potentially
deadly. It was bad enough sometimes knowing what <em>would</em>
happen; if she started knowing what <em>might</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;All I
know is this. If he stays close to you, you live. If he gets too
far away, for too long, you are going to die. Both of you. I don&rsquo;t
know why I should have seen anything about you in his aura, but you
seemed like part of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan&rsquo;s smile would have done to peel a pear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d as
soon sail in a rotting hull full of last month&rsquo;s eels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought he&rsquo;d follow us. Are they really
going to make us go with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Min. He is going to lead our armies to
victory. And make my life the Pit of Doom! So he&rsquo;s going to save my
life, is he? I don&rsquo;t know that it is worth it.&rdquo; Taking a deep
breath, she smoothed her skirts. &ldquo;When you have those washed and
ironed, bring them to me. I will take them up to him. You can clean
his boots before you go to sleep tonight. We have a room&mdash;a
cubbyhole&mdash;near him, so we will be close if he calls to have
his bloody pillows plumped!&rdquo; She was gone before Min could
protest.</p>

<p>Staring down at the wadded shirts, Min was sure that
she knew who was going to be doing all of Gareth Bryne&rsquo;s laundry,
and it was not Siuan Sanche. <em>Rand bloody al&rsquo;Thor</em>. Fall in
love with a man, and you ended up doing laundry, even if it did
belong to another man. When she marched into the kitchen to demand
a washtub and hot water, she was snarling every bit as much as
Siuan.</p>
