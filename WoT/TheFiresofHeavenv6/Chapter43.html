<h4><em>This Place, This Day</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
next morning Rand was up and dressed well before
first light. In truth, he had not slept, and it had not been
Aviendha who kept him awake, not even after she began undressing
before he could put out the lamps and channeled one alight again as
soon as he did, chiding him that she was unable to see in the dark
even if he could. He made no reply, and hours later, had hardly
noticed when she rose, a good hour before he did, dressed and left.
He did not even think to wonder where she was going.</p>

<p>The thoughts that had had him staring up into the
blackness still ran through his head. Men would die today. A great
many men, even if everything went perfectly. Nothing he did now
would change it; today would run out according to the Pattern. But
over and over he mulled the decisions he had made since he first
entered the Waste. Could he have done something different,
something that would have avoided this day, this place? Next time,
perhaps. The tasseled length of spear lay atop his sword belt and
scabbarded blade beside his blankets. There would be a next time,
and one beyond that, and beyond again.</p>

<p>While darkness still held, the chiefs came in a bunch
for a few final words, to report that their men were in position
and ready. Not that anything else was expected. Stone-faced as they
were, some emotion showed. An odd mix, though, a skim of ebullience
over somberness.</p>

<p>Erim actually wore a slight smile. &ldquo;A good day, to
see the end of the Shaido,&rdquo; he said finally. He seemed to be
walking on his toes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light willing,&rdquo; Bael said, his head brushing the
roof of the tent, &ldquo;we will wash the spears in Couladin&rsquo;s blood
before sunfall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad luck to talk of what will be,&rdquo; Han muttered. The
skim was very thin on him, of course. &ldquo;Fate will decide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded. &ldquo;The Light send it does not decide on
too many of our number dead.&rdquo; He wished his concern were only that
few men should die because men should not have their lives cut
short, but there were many more days to come. He would need every
spear to bring order to this side of the Dragonwall. That was a
bone between him and Couladin every bit as much as the rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Life is a dream,&rdquo; Rhuarc told him, and Han and the
others nodded agreement. Life was only a dream, and all dreams had
to end. Aiel did not run toward death, yet they did not run from it
either.</p>

<p>As they were departing, Bael paused. &ldquo;Are you certain
of what you want the Maidens to do? Sulin has been speaking to the
Wise Ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So that was what Melaine had been at Bael about. The
way Rhuarc stopped to listen, he had been hearing from Amys on the
subject, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everyone else is doing what they are supposed to
without complaining, Bael.&rdquo; That was unfair, but this was no game.
&ldquo;If the Maidens want special consideration, Sulin can come to me,
not go running to the Wise Ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Had they been anything but Aiel, Rhuarc and Bael
would have been shaking their heads as they left. Rand supposed
each would get an earful from his wife, but they would have to live
with it. If <em>Far Dareis Mai</em> carried his honor, this time
they would carry it where he wanted.</p>

<p>To Rand&rsquo;s surprise Lan appeared just as he was ready
to go out himself. The Warder&rsquo;s cloak hung down his back,
disturbing the vision as it rippled with his movements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Moiraine with you?&rdquo; Rand had expected Lan to be
glued to her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is fretting in her tent. She cannot possibly
Heal even all of the worst hurt today.&rdquo; That was her choice of how
to help; she could not use the Power as a weapon today, but she
could Heal. &ldquo;Waste always angers her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It angers us all,&rdquo; Rand snapped. His taking Egwene
away probably upset her, too. As far as he could tell, Egwene was
not very good at Healing on her own, but she could have aided
Moiraine. Well, he needed her to keep her promise. &ldquo;Tell Moiraine
if she needs help, ask some of the Wise Ones who can channel.&rdquo; But
few Wise Ones had any knowledge of Healing. &ldquo;She can link with them
and use their strength.&rdquo; He hesitated. Had Moiraine ever spoken of
linking to him? &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t come here to tell me Moiraine is
brooding,&rdquo; he said irritably. It was difficult sometimes, keeping
straight what came from her, what from Asmodean, and what bubbled
up from Lews Therin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came to ask why you&rsquo;ve taken to wearing a sword
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine asked already. Did she send&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan&rsquo;s face did not change, but he cut in roughly. &ldquo;I
want to know. You can make a sword from the Power, or kill without,
but suddenly you are wearing steel on your hip again. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unconsciously, Rand ran one hand up the long hilt at
his side. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hardly fair to use the Power that way. Especially
against someone who can&rsquo;t channel. I might as well fight a
child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Warder stood silent for a time, studying him.
&ldquo;You mean to kill Couladin yourself,&rdquo; he said at last in flat
tones. &ldquo;That sword against his spears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to seek him out, but who can say what
will happen?&rdquo; Rand shrugged uncomfortably. Not to hunt for him. But
if ever his twisting of chance was to favor him, let it be to bring
him face-to-face with Couladin. &ldquo;Besides, I&rsquo;d not put it past him
to seek me. The threats I&rsquo;ve heard from him have been personal,
Lan.&rdquo; Raising one fist, he thrust his arm out of a crimson
coatsleeve enough to make the golden-maned Dragon&rsquo;s fore end
plainly visible. &ldquo;Couladin won&rsquo;t rest while I live, not so long as
we both wear these.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And truth to tell, he would not rest himself until
only one living man bore the Dragons. By rights he should lump
Asmodean in with Couladin. Asmodean had marked the Shaido. But
Couladin&rsquo;s unrestrained ambition had made it possible; his ambition
and refusal to abide by Aiel law and custom had led inevitably to
this place, this day. Beyond the bleakness and war between Aiel,
there was Taien to be laid at Couladin&rsquo;s feet, and Selean, and
dozens of ruined towns and villages since, countless hundreds of
burned farms. Unburied men and women and children had fed the
vultures. If he was the Dragon Reborn, if he had any right to
demand that any nation follow him, much less Cairhien, then he owed
them justice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then have him beheaded when he&rsquo;s taken,&rdquo; Lan said
harshly. &ldquo;Set a hundred men, or a thousand, with no purpose but to
find and take him. But do not be fool enough to fight him! You are
good with a blade now&mdash;very good&mdash;but Aielmen are all
but born with spear and buckler in hand. A spear through your
heart, and all has been for naught.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I should avoid the fighting? Would you, if
Moiraine had no claims on you? Will Rhuarc, or Bael, or any of
them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not the Dragon Reborn. The, fate of the world
does not rest on me.&rdquo; But the momentary heat had gone from his
voice. Without Moiraine, he would have been wherever the fighting
was hottest. If anything, he looked to be regretting those claims
at the moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not take needless risks, Lan, but I can&rsquo;t run
from them all.&rdquo; The Seanchan spear would remain in the tent today;
it would only get in his way if he did find Couladin. &ldquo;Come. The
Aiel will finish it without us if we stand here much longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he ducked outside, only a few stars remained,
and a thin brightness outlined the eastern horizon sharply. That
was not why he stopped, though, and Lan with him. Maidens made a
ring around the tent, shoulder to shoulder, facing inward. A thick
ring that spread down the dark shrouded slopes, <em>
cadin&rsquo;sor</em>-clad women jammed so a mouse could not have slipped
through. Jeade&rsquo;en was nowhere in sight, though a <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>
had been ordered to have him saddled and waiting.</p>

<p>Not Maidens alone. Two women in the front rank wore
bulky skirts and pale blouses, their hair bound back with folded
scarves. It was too black yet to discern faces with any certainty,
but there was something in the shape of those two, in their
folded-arm stance, that named Egwene and Aviendha.</p>

<p>Sulin stepped forward before he could open his mouth
to ask what they were up to. &ldquo;We have come to escort the <em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> to the tower with Egwene Sedai and Aviendha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who put you up to this?&rdquo; Rand demanded. One glance
at Lan showed it had not been him. Even in the darkness the Warder
looked startled. For a moment anyway, his head jerking up; nothing
surprised Lan for long. &ldquo;Egwene is supposed to be on her way to the
tower now, and the Maidens are supposed to be there to guard her.
What she will do today is very important. She must be protected
while she does it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will protect her.&rdquo; Sulin&rsquo;s voice was as flat as a
planed board. &ldquo;And the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, who gave his honor to
<em>Far Dareis Mai</em> to carry.&rdquo; A murmur of approval rippled
through the Maidens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It only makes sense, Rand,&rdquo; Egwene said from where
she stood. &ldquo;If one using the Power as a weapon will make the battle
shorter, three will shorten it even more. And you are stronger than
Aviendha and me together.&rdquo; She did not sound as if she liked saying
that last. Aviendha said nothing, but the way she stood was
eloquent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is ridiculous,&rdquo; Rand scowled. &ldquo;Let me through,
and go to your assigned place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sulin did not budge. &ldquo;<em>Far Dareis Mai</em> carries
the honor of the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>,&rdquo; she said calmly, and others
took it up. No louder, but from so many women&rsquo;s voices it made a
high rumble. &ldquo;<em>Far Dareis Mai</em> carries the honor of the <em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>. <em>Far Dareis Mai</em> carries the honor of the
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said let me through,&rdquo; he demanded the instant the
sound died.</p>

<p>As if he had told them to begin again, they did.
&ldquo;<em>Far Dareis Mai</em> carries the honor of the <em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>. <em>Far Dareis Mai</em> carries the honor of the
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>.&rdquo; Sulin just stood there looking at him.</p>

<p>After a moment Lan leaned close to murmur dryly, &ldquo;A
woman is no less a woman because she carries a spear. Did you ever
meet one who could be diverted from anything she really wanted?
Give over, or we will stand here all day while you argue and they
chant at you.&rdquo; The Warder hesitated, then added, &ldquo;Besides which,
it does make sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene opened her mouth as the litany fell off once
more, but Aviendha put a hand on her arm and whispered a few words,
and Egwene said nothing. He knew what she had intended to say,
though. She had been about to tell him he was a stubborn foolish
wool-head or some such.</p>

<p>The trouble was that he was beginning to feel like
one. It <em>did</em> make sense for him to go to the tower. He had
nothing to do elsewhere&mdash;the battle was in the hands of the
chiefs and fate, now&mdash;and he would be of more use channeling
than riding around hoping to meet with Couladin. If being an
infantryman could pull Couladin to him, it could draw him to the
tower as easily as anywhere else. Not that he would have much
chance of seeing the man, not after ordering every last Maiden to
defend the tower.</p>

<p>But how to back down and retain a scrap of dignity
after blustering left, right and center? &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided I can do the
most good from the tower,&rdquo; he said, his face going hot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> commands,&rdquo; Sulin replied
without a hint of mockery, just as if it had been his idea from the
first. Lan nodded, then slipped away, the Maidens making narrow
room for him.</p>

<p>The gap closed up right behind Lan, though, and when
they began to move, Rand had no choice except to go with them. He
could have channeled, of course, flung Fire about or knocked them
down with Air, but that was hardly the way to behave with people on
his side, let alone women. Besides, he was not sure he could have
made them leave him short of killing, and maybe not then. And
anyway, he had decided he was of most use at the tower, after
all.</p>

<p>Egwene and Aviendha were as silent as Sulin as they
walked, for which he was grateful. Of course, at least part of
their silence had to do with picking their way uphill and down in
the dark without breaking their necks. Aviendha did raise a mutter
now and then that he barely caught, something angry about skirts.
But neither made fun of him for backing down so visibly. Though
that might well come later. Women seemed to enjoy jabbing the
needle in just when you thought the danger was past.</p>

<p>The sky began to lighten into gray, and as the log
tower came into sight above the trees, he broke the quiet himself.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect you to be part of this, Aviendha. I thought you
said Wise Ones take no part in battles.&rdquo; He was sure she had. A
Wise One could walk through the middle of a battle untouched, or
into any hold or stand of a clan that had blood feud with hers, but
she took no part in fighting, certainly not with channeling. Until
he came to the Waste, even most Aiel had not really known that some
Wise Ones could channel, though there were rumors of strange
abilities, and sometimes something the Aiel thought might be close
to channeling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a Wise One yet,&rdquo; she replied pleasantly,
shifting her shawl. &ldquo;If an Aes Sedai like Egwene can do this, so
can I. I arranged it this morning, while you still slept, but I
have thought of it since you first asked Egwene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was enough light now for him to see Egwene
flush. When she saw him glancing at her, she tripped over nothing,
and he had to catch her arm to keep her from falling. Avoiding his
eyes, she jerked free. Maybe he would not have to worry about any
needles from her. They started uphill through the sparse woods
toward the tower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t try to stop you? Amys, I mean, or Bair,
or Melaine?&rdquo; He knew they had not. If they had, she would not be
there.</p>

<p>Aviendha shook her head, then frowned thoughtfully.
&ldquo;They talked for a long time with Sorilea, then told me to do as I
thought I must. Usually they tell me to do as <em>they</em> think I
must.&rdquo; Glancing at him sideways, she added, &ldquo;I heard Melaine say
that you bring change to everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do that,&rdquo; he said, setting his foot on the bottom
rung of the first ladder. &ldquo;The Light help me, that I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The view from the platform was magnificent even to
the naked eye, the land spreading out in wooded hills. The trees
were thick enough to hide the Aiel moving toward Cairhien&mdash;most would already be in position&mdash;but dawn cast the city
itself in golden light. A quick scan through one of the looking
glasses showed the barren hills along the river placid and
seemingly empty of life. That would change soon enough. The Shaido
were there, if concealed for now. They would not remain concealed
when he began to direct&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What? Not balefire. Whatever he did,
it had to unnerve the Shaido as much as possible before his Aiel
attacked.</p>

<p>Egwene and Aviendha had been taking turns looking
through the other long tube, with pauses for quiet discussion, but
now they were simply talking softly. Exchanging nods finally, they
moved closer to the railing and stood with their hands on the
rough-hewn timber, staring toward Cairhien. Goose bumps suddenly
dotted his skin. One of them was channeling, maybe both.</p>

<p>It was the wind that he noticed first, blowing toward
the city. Not a breeze; the first real wind he had felt in this
country. And clouds were beginning to form above Cairhien, heaviest
to the south, growing thicker and blacker as he watched, roiling.
Only there, over Cairhien and the Shaido. Everywhere else as far as
he could see, the sky was a clear blue, with only a few high thin
white wisps. Yet thunder rolled, long and solid. Suddenly lightning
stabbed down, a jagged silver streak that rent a hilltop below the
city. Before the crack of the first bolt reached the tower, two
more crackled earthward. Wild forks danced across the sky, but
those single lances of brilliant white struck with the regularity
of a heartbeat. Abruptly, ground exploded where no lightning had
fallen, fountaining fifty feet, then again somewhere else, and
again.</p>

<p>Rand had no idea which woman was doing what, but they
certainly looked set to harrow the Shaido out. Time to do his bit,
or stand watching. Reaching out, he seized <em>saidin</em>. Icy
fire scoured the outside of the Void that surrounded what was Rand
al&rsquo;Thor. Coldly, he ignored the oily filth seeping into him from
the taint, juggled wild torrents of the Power that threatened to
engulf him.</p>

<p>At this distance, there were limits to what he could
do. In fact, it was about as far as he could do anything, really,
without <em>angreal</em> or <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>. Very likely that
was why the women were channeling one lightning bolt at a time, one
explosion; if he was at his boundary, they must be stretching
theirs.</p>

<p>A memory slid across the emptiness. Not his; Lews
Therin&rsquo;s. For once he did not care. In an instant he channeled, and
a ball of fire enveloped the top of a hill nearly five miles away,
a churning mass of pale yellow flame. When it faded, he could see
without the looking glass that the hill was lower now, and black at
the crest, seemingly melted. Between the three of them, there might
be no need for the clans to fight Couladin at all.</p>

<p><em>Ilyena, my love, forgive me!</em></p>

<p>The Void trembled; for an instant Rand teetered on
the brink of destruction. Waves of the One Power crashed through
him in a froth of fear; the taint seemed to solidify around his
heart, a reeking stone.</p>

<p>Clutching the rail until his knuckles ached, he
forced himself back to calmness, forced the emptiness to hold.
Thereafter he refused to listen to the thoughts in his head.
Instead he concentrated everything on channeling, on methodically
searing one hill after another.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Standing well back into what treeline there was on
the crest, Mat held Pips&rsquo; nose under his arm so the gelding would
not whicker as he watched a thousand or so Aiel slanting toward him
across the hills from the south. The sun was just peeking over the
horizon, stretching long rippling shadows to one side of the
trotting mass. The night&rsquo;s warmth was already beginning to give way
to the heat of day. The air would swelter once the sun reached any
height. He was already beginning to sweat.</p>

<p>The Aiel had not seen him yet, but he had few doubts
that they would if he waited there much longer. It hardly mattered
that they very nearly had to be Rand&rsquo;s men&mdash;if Couladin had
men to the south, the day was going to get very interesting for
those stupid enough to be in the middle of the fighting&mdash;hardly mattered because he was not going to run the risk of letting
them see him. He had already come too close to an arrow this
morning for that kind of carelessness. Absently he fingered the
neat slice across the shoulder of his coat. Good shooting, at a
moving target only half-seen through trees. He could have admired
it more had he not been the target.</p>

<p>Without taking his eyes from the approaching Aiel, he
carefully backed Pips deeper into the sparse thicket; if they saw
him and picked up their pace, he wanted to know. People said Aiel
could run down a man on horseback, and he meant to have a good lead
if they tried.</p>

<p>Not until the trees hid them from him did he quicken
his own step, leading Pips onto the reverse slope before mounting
and turning west. A man could not be too careful if he wanted to
stay alive on this day and this ground. He muttered to himself as
he rode, hat pulled low to shade his face and black-hafted spear
across his pommel. West. Again.</p>

<p>The day had begun so well, a good two hours before
first light, when Melindhra had gone off to some meeting of the
Maidens. Thinking him asleep, she had not glanced at him as she
stalked out muttering half under her breath about Rand al&rsquo;Thor and
honor and &ldquo;<em>Far Dareis Mai</em>, above all.&rdquo; She sounded as if
she were arguing with herself, but frankly, he did not care whether
she wanted to pickle Rand or stew him. Before she was a minute out
of the tent, he was stuffing his saddlebags. No one had so much as
looked at him twice while he saddled Pips and ghosted away to the
south. A good beginning. Only he had not counted on columns of
Taardad and Tomanelle and every other bloody clan sweeping around
to the south. No consolation that it was very close to what he had
babbled to Lan. He wanted to go south, and those Aiel had forced
him toward the Alguenya. Toward where the fighting would be.</p>

<p>A mile or two on, he cautiously turned Pips upslope,
pausing deep in the scattered trees on the crest. It was a higher
hill than most, and he had a good view. This time there were no
Aiel in sight, but the column winding along the bottom of the
twisting hill valley was almost as bad. Mounted Tairens had the
lead behind a knot of colorful lords&rsquo; banners, with a gap back to a
thick, bristling snake of pikemen in the Tairens&rsquo; dust, and then
another to the Cairhienin horse, with their multitude of banners
and pennants and <em>con</em>. The Cairhienin maintained no order
at all, milling about as lords shifted back and forth for
conversation, but at least they had flankers out to either side. In
any case, as soon as they were past, he had a clear route south.
<em>And I&rsquo;ll not stop until I&rsquo;m halfway to the bloody
Erinin!</em></p>

<p>A flicker of movement caught his eye, well ahead of
the column below. He would not have seen it except for being so
high. None of the riders could have, certainly. Digging his small
looking glass from his saddlebags&mdash;Kin Tovere liked the dice&mdash;he peered toward what he had seen, and whistled softly
through his teeth. Aiel, at least as many as the men in the valley,
and if they were not Couladin&rsquo;s, they meant to give a nameday
surprise, for they were lying low among the dying bushes and dead
leaves.</p>

<p>For a moment he drummed fingers on his thigh. Shortly
there were going to be some corpses down there. And not many of
them Aiel. <em>None of my affair. I am out of this, out of here,
and heading south</em>. He would wait a bit, then head off while
they were all too busy to notice.</p>

<p>This fellow Weiramon&mdash;he had heard the
gray-beard&rsquo;s name yesterday&mdash;was a stone fool. <em>No
foreguard out, and no scouts, or he&rsquo;d know what was bloody in store
for him</em>. For that matter, the way the hills lay, the way the
valley twisted, the Aiel could not see the column, either, only its
thin dust rising skyward. They certainly had had scouts to get
themselves in place; they could not just be waiting there on the
off chance.</p>

<p>Idly whistling &ldquo;Dance with Jak o&rsquo; the Shadows,&rdquo; he
put the looking glass back to his eye and studied the hilltops.
Yes. The Aiel commander had left a few men where they could signal
a warning just before the column entered the killing ground. But
even they could not possibly see anything yet. In a few minutes the
first Tairens would come in sight, but until then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It came as a shock when he heeled Pips to a gallop
downslope. <em>What under the Light am I doing?</em> Well, he could
not just stand by and let them all go their deaths like geese to
the knife. He would warn them. That was all. Tell what lay in wait
ahead, then he was gone.</p>

<p>The Cairhienin outriders saw him coming before he
reached the bottom of the slope, of course, heard Pips&rsquo; dead-flat
charge. Two or three lowered their lances. Mat did not precisely
enjoy having a foot and a half of steel pointed at him, and still
less three times over, but obviously one man was no threat, even
riding like a madman. They let him pass, and he swung in near the
lead Cairhienin lords long enough to shout, &ldquo;Halt here! Now! By
order of the Lord Dragon! Else he&rsquo;ll channel your head into your
belly and feed you your own feet for breakfast!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His heels dug in, and Pips sprang ahead. He only
glanced back to be sure they were doing what he said&mdash;they
were, if showing some confusion over it; the hills hid them from
the Aiel still, and once their dust settled, the Aiel would have no
way of knowing they were there&mdash;and then he was lying low on
the gelding&rsquo;s neck, whipping Pips with his hat and galloping up
alongside the infantry.</p>

<p><em>If I wait to let Weiramon pass the orders, it&rsquo;ll
be too late. That&rsquo;s all</em>. He would give his warning and go.</p>

<p>The foot marched in blocks of two hundred or so
pikemen, with one mounted officer in the front of each and maybe
fifty archers or crossbowmen at the rear. Most looked at him
curiously as he dashed by, Pips&rsquo; heels kicking up spurts of dust,
but none broke stride. Some of the officers&rsquo; mounts frisked as if
the riders wanted to come see what had him in such a hurry, but
none of them left their places either. Good discipline. They would
need it.</p>

<p>Defenders of the Stone brought up the tail end of the
Tairens in their breastplates and puffy black-and-gold striped
coatsleeves, plumes of various colors on the rimmed helmets marking
officers and underofficers. The rest were armored the same, but
bore the colors of various lords on their sleeves. The silk-coated
lords themselves rode at the very front in ornate breastplates and
large white plumes, their banners rippling behind them in a rising
breeze toward the city.</p>

<p>Reining around in front of them so quickly that Pips
danced, Mat shouted, &ldquo;Halt, in the name of the Lord Dragon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed the fastest way to stop them, but for a
moment he thought they meant to ride right over him. Almost at the
last moment, a young lord he remembered from outside Rand&rsquo;s tent
flung up a hand, and then they were all drawing rein in a flurry of
shouted orders that ran back along the column. Weiramon was not
there; not a lord was as much as ten years older than Mat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; demanded the fellow
who had signaled. Dark eyes glared arrogantly down a sharp nose,
chin lifted so his pointed beard looked ready to stab. Sweat
trickling down his face spoiled it only a little. &ldquo;The Lord Dragon
himself gave me this command. Who are you to&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He cut off as another man Mat knew caught his sleeve,
whispering urgently. Potato-faced Estean looked haggard beneath his
helmet as well as hot&mdash;the Aiel had wrung him out concerning
conditions in the city, so Mat had heard&mdash;but he had gambled
at cards with Mat in Tear. He knew exactly who Mat was. Estean&rsquo;s
breastplate alone had chips in the ornate gilding; none of the
others had done more than ride around looking pretty. Yet.</p>

<p>Sharp-nose&rsquo;s chin came down as he listened, and when
Estean left off, he spoke in a more moderate tone. &ldquo;No offense
intended&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Lord Mat. I am Melanril, of House Asegora.
How may I serve the Lord Dragon?&rdquo; Moderation slipped into actual
hesitation at that last, and Estean broke in anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should we &lsquo;halt&rsquo;? I know the Lord Dragon told us
to hold back, Mat, but burn my soul, there&rsquo;s no honor in sitting
and letting the Aiel do all the fighting. Why should we be saddled
with chasing them after they&rsquo;re broken? Besides, my father is in
the city, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He trailed off under Mat&rsquo;s stare.</p>

<p>Mat shook his head, fanning himself with his hat. The
fools were not even where they should be. There was no chance of
turning them back, either. If Melanril would go&mdash;and looking
at him, Mat was not sure he would, even on supposed orders from the
Lord Dragon&mdash;there was still no chance. He sat his saddle in plain
sight of the Aiel lookouts. If the column started turning around,
they would know themselves discovered, and very likely they would
attack while the Tairens and the Cairhienin pike were tangled up.
It would be a slaughter as surely as if they had gone ahead in
ignorance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Weiramon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord Dragon sent him back to Tear,&rdquo; Melanril
replied slowly. &ldquo;To deal with the Illianer pirates, and the bandits
on the Plains of Maredo. He was reluctant to go, of course, even
for so great a responsibility, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Pardon, Lord Mat, but if
the Lord Dragon sent you, how is it that you don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat cut him off. &ldquo;I am no lord. And if you want to
question what Rand lets people know, ask him.&rdquo; That set the fellow
back; he was not about to question the Lord bloody Dragon about
anything. Weiramon was a fool, but at least he was old enough to
have been in a battle. Except for Estean, looking like a sack of
turnips tied on his horse, all this lot had seen was a tavern fight
or two. And maybe a few duels&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Fat lot of good that would do
them. &ldquo;Now, you all listen to me. When you pass through that gap
ahead between the next two hills, Aiel are going to come down on
you like an avalanche.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He might as well have told them there was going to be
a ball, with the women all sighing to meet a Tairen lordling. Eager
grins broke out, and they, started dancing their horses about,
slapping each other on the shoulder and boasting how many they
would kill. Estean was odd man out, just sighing and easing his
sword in its scabbard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stare up there!&rdquo; Mat snapped. The fools. In a
minute they would be calling the charge! &ldquo;Keep your eyes on me. On
me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was who he was friends with that settled them
down. Melanril and the others in their fine, unmarked armor frowned
impatiently, not understanding why he did not want to let them
begin the business of killing Aiel savages. If he had not been
Rand&rsquo;s friend they probably would have trampled him and Pips
both.</p>

<p>He could let them go charging off. They would do it
piecemeal, leaving the pikes and the Cairhienin horse behind,
though the Cairhienin might join in once they realized what was
happening. And they would all die. The smart thing would be to let
them get on with it while he headed in the opposite direction. The
only trouble was that once these idiots let the Aiel know they were
discovered, those Aiel might decide to do something fancy, like
swinging around to take the strung-out fools in the flank. If that
happened, there was no certainty that he would get clear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the Lord Dragon wants you to do,&rdquo; he told them,
&ldquo;is to ride ahead slowly, just as if there wasn&rsquo;t an Aiel inside a
hundred miles. As soon as the pikes are through the gap, they&rsquo;ll
form a hollow square, and you get yourselves inside it double
quick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inside!&rdquo; Melanril protested. Angry mutters rose from
the other young lords&mdash;except Estean, who looked thoughtful.
&ldquo;There is no honor in hiding behind stinking&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bloody do it,&rdquo; Mat roared, reining Pips close to
Melanril&rsquo;s horse, &ldquo;or if the bloody Aiel don&rsquo;t kill you, Rand will,
and whatever he leaves, I&rsquo;ll chop into sausage myself!&rdquo; This was
taking too long; the Aiel had to be wondering what they were
talking about by now. &ldquo;With any luck, you will be set before the
Aiel can hit you. If you have horsebows, use them. Otherwise, hold
tight. You&rsquo;ll get your bloody charge, and you&rsquo;ll know when, but if
you move too early&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo; He could almost feel time running
down.</p>

<p>Setting the butt of his spear in his stirrup like a
lance, he heeled Pips back down the column. When he glanced over
his shoulder, Melanril and the others were talking and peering
after him. At least they were not haring up the valley.</p>

<p>The commander of the pikemen proved to be a pale,
slender Cairhienin, half a head shorter than Mat and mounted on a
gray gelding that looked past ready for the pasture. Daerid had
hard eyes, though, an oft-broken nose, and three white scars
crisscrossing his face, one of them not very old. He took off his
bell-shaped helmet while he talked with Mat; the front of his head
was shaved. No lord, he. Maybe he had been part of the army, before
the civil war started. Yes, his men knew how to form a hedgehog. He
had not faced Aiel, but he had faced brigands, and Andoran cavalry.
There was an implication that he had fought other Cairhienin as
well, for one of the Houses contesting for the throne. Daerid
sounded neither eager nor reluctant; he sounded like a man with a
job of work to do.</p>

<p>The column stepped off as Mat turned Pips&rsquo; head the
other way. They marched with a measured pace, and a quick look
behind showed the Tairens&rsquo; horses moving no faster.</p>

<p>He let Pips go a little quicker than a walk, but not
much. It seemed he could feel Aiel eyes on his back, feel them
wondering what he had said, and where he was going now and why.
<em>Just a messenger who&rsquo;s delivered his message and is going away.
Nothing to worry about</em>. He certainly hoped that was what the
Aiel thought, but his shoulders did not untense until he was sure
they could no longer see him.</p>

<p>The Cairhienin were still waiting where he had left
them. They still had their flankers out, too. Banners and <em>
con</em> made a thicket where the lords had gathered, one in ten or
better of the Cairhienin&rsquo;s number. Most of them wore plain
breastplates, and where there was gilt or silverwork, it was
battered as though a drunken blacksmith had been at it. Some of
their mounts made Daerid&rsquo;s look like Lan&rsquo;s warhorse. Could they
even do what was needed? But the faces that turned to him were
hard, the gazes harder.</p>

<p>He was in the clear, now, hidden from the Aiel. He
could ride on. After telling this lot what was expected of them,
anyway. He had sent the others on into the Aiel trap; he could not
simply abandon them.</p>

<p>Talmanes of House Delovinde, his <em>con</em> three
yellow stars on blue and his banner a black fox, was even shorter
than Daerid and had three years on Mat at most, but he led these
Cairhienin although there were older men and even gray hair
present. His eyes held as little expression as Daerid&rsquo;s, and he
looked like a coiled whip. His armor and sword were utterly plain.
Once he had told Mat his name the man listened quietly while Mat
laid out his plan, leaning a little out of the saddle to cut lines
in the ground with the sword-bladed spear.</p>

<p>The other Cairhienin lords gathered round on their
horses, watching, but none so sharply as Talmanes. Talmanes studied
the map he drew, and studied him from boots to hat, even his spear.
When he was done, the fellow still did not speak, until Mat barked,
&ldquo;Well? I don&rsquo;t care whether you take it or leave it, but your
friends will be hip-deep in Aiel in not much longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Tairens are no friends of mine. And Daerid is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;useful. Certainly not a friend.&rdquo; Dry chuckles ran through the
onlooking lords at the suggestion. &ldquo;But I will lead one half, if
you lead the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Talmanes pulled off one steel-backed gauntlet and put
out his hand, but for a moment Mat only stared at it. Lead? Him?
<em>I&rsquo;m a gambler, not a soldier. A lover</em>. Memories of battles
long gone spun through his head, but he forced them down. All he
had to do was ride on. But then maybe Talmanes would leave Estean
and Daerid and the rest to roast. On the spit Mat had hung them
from. Even so, it was a surprise to him when he grasped the other&rsquo;s
hand and said, &ldquo;You just be there when you&rsquo;re supposed to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For reply Talmanes began calling off names in a quick
voice. Lords and lordlings reined toward Mat, each followed by a
bannerman and perhaps a dozen retainers, until he had four hundred
odd of the Cairhienin. Talmanes did not have much to say after,
either; he just led the remainder west at a trot, trailing a faint
cloud of dust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep together,&rdquo; Mat told his half. &ldquo;Charge when I
say charge, run when I say run, and don&rsquo;t make any noise you don&rsquo;t
have to.&rdquo; There was the creak of saddles and the thud of hooves as
they followed him, of course, but at least they did not talk, or
ask questions.</p>

<p>A last glimpse of the other bristle of bright banners
and <em>con</em>, and then a twist in the shallow valley hid them.
How had he gotten into this? It had all started so simply. Just
give warning and go. Each step after had seemed so small, so
necessary. And now he had waded waist deep into the mud, and no
choice but to keep on. He hoped Talmanes meant to show up. The man
had not even asked who he was.</p>

<p>The hill valley twisted and forked as he angled
north, but he had a good sense of direction. For instance, he knew
exactly which way lay south and safety, and it was not the way he
was heading. Dark clouds were forming up there toward the city, the
first he had seen so thick in a long time. Rain would break the
drought&mdash;good for the farmers, if any remained&mdash;and
settle the dust&mdash;good for horsemen, so they did not announce
themselves too early. Maybe if it rained, the Aiel would give up
and go home. The wind was beginning to pick up, too, bringing a
little cool, for a wonder.</p>

<p>The sound of fighting drifted over the crests, men
shouting, men screaming. It had begun.</p>

<p>Mat turned Pips, raised his spear and swung it right
and left. He was almost surprised when the Cairhienin formed into
one long line to either side of him, facing upslope. The gesture
had been instinctive, from another time and place, but then, these
men had seen fighting. He started Pips up through the scattered
trees at a slow walk, and they kept pace to the quiet jangle of
bridles.</p>

<p>His first thought on reaching the height was relief
at seeing Talmanes and his men coming into sight on the crest
across from him. His second was to curse.</p>

<p>Daerid had formed the hedgehog, spiny thickets of
pikes four deep interspersed with bowmen to make a large hollow
square. Long pikes made it difficult for the Shaido to get close,
however they rushed in, and the archers and crossbowmen were
exchanging shots hot and fast with the Aiel. Men were falling on
both sides, but the pikes simply closed in when one of their number
went down, making the square tighter. Of course, the Shaido did not
appear to slacken their assault either.</p>

<p>The Defenders were dismounted in the center, and
maybe half the Tairen lords with their retainers. Half. That was
what made him want to curse. The rest dashed about among the Aiel,
slashing and stabbing with sword and lance in knots of five or ten,
or alone. Dozens of riderless horses told how well they were doing.
Melanril was off with only his bannerman, laying about with his
blade. Two Aiel darted in to neatly hamstring the lordling&rsquo;s horse;
it fell, head flailing&mdash;Mat was sure it screamed, but the din
swallowed it&mdash;and then Melanril vanished behind <em>
cadin&rsquo;sor</em>-clad figures, spears stabbing. The bannerman lasted
a moment longer.</p>

<p><em>Good riddance</em>, Mat thought grimly. Standing
in his stirrups, he raised the sword-bladed spear high, then swept
it forward, shouting, &ldquo;<em>Los! Los caba&rsquo;drin!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>He would have had the words back if he could, and not
because they were Old Tongue; it was a boiling cauldron down in the
valley. But whether or not any of the Cairhienin understood a
command of &ldquo;horsemen forward&rdquo; in the Old Tongue, they understood
the gesture, especially when he dropped back into his saddle and
dug in his heels. Not that he really wanted to, but he could not
see any choice now. He had put those men down there&mdash;some
might have gotten away if he had told them to turn and run&mdash;and he just did not have a choice.</p>

<p>Banners and <em>con</em> waving, the Cairhienin
charged downhill with him, shouting battle cries. In imitation of
him, no doubt, though what he was shouting was &ldquo;Blood and bloody
ashes!&rdquo; Across the valley, Talmanes raced down just as hard.</p>

<p>Sure that they had all the wetlanders penned, the
Shaido never saw the others until crashed into from behind on both
sides. It was then that the lightning began to fall. And after that
things really got hairy.</p>
