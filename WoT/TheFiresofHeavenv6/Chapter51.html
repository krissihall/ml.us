<h4><em>News Comes to Cairhien</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">A</span>
thin thread of blue smoke rising from the plain,
short-stemmed pipe clenched in his teeth, Rand rested one hand on
the balcony&rsquo;s stone railing and looked into the garden below. Sharp
shadows were lengthening; the sun was a red ball falling through a
cloudless sky. Ten days in Cairhien, and this seemed the first
moment he had stood still when he was not asleep. Selande stood
close by his side, pale face tilted up to watch him, not the
garden. Her hair was not so elaborately done as that of a woman of
higher rank, but it still added half a foot to her height. He tried
to ignore her, but it was difficult to ignore a woman who insisted
on pressing her firm bosom against your arm. The meeting had gone
on long enough for him to want a moment&rsquo;s break. He had known it
for a mistake as soon as Selande followed him out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know a secluded pool,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;where
this heat might be escaped. A sheltered pool, where nothing would
disturb us.&rdquo; The music of Asmodean&rsquo;s harp drifted out through the
square arches behind them. Something light, cool sounding.</p>

<p>Rand puffed a little more vigorously. The heat.
Nothing compared to the Waste, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Autumn should be coming
on, yet the afternoon felt like the depths of summer. A rainless
summer. Shirt-sleeved men in the garden were spreading water from
buckets, doing it late to avoid evaporation, but too much was brown
or dying. The weather could not be natural. The burning sun mocked
him. Moiraine agreed, and Asmodean, but neither knew what to do or
how, any more than he did. Sammael. Sammael he could do something
about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cool water,&rdquo; Selande murmured, &ldquo;and you and I
alone.&rdquo; She snuggled closer, though he did not see how it was
possible.</p>

<p>He wondered when the next taunt would come. No
dashing off in a temper, whatever Sammael did. Once his methodical
buildup in Tear was done, then he would loose the lightning. One
crushing stroke to put an end to Sammael, and add Illian to his bag
at the same time. With Illian, Tear and Cairhien, plus an army of
Aiel big enough to overwhelm any nation in weeks, he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you not like to swim? I do not swim well
myself, but surely you will teach me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand sighed. For a moment he wished Aviendha was
there. No. The last thing he wanted was a bruised Selande running
screaming with her clothes half torn off.</p>

<p>Hooding his eyes, he looked down at her and spoke
quietly around his pipe. &ldquo;I can channel.&rdquo; She blinked, drawing back
without moving a muscle. They never understood why he would bring
that up; for them it was something to be glossed over, ignored if
possible. &ldquo;They say I&rsquo;ll go mad. But I&rsquo;m not mad yet. Not yet.&rdquo; He
chuckled from deep in his chest, then cut it off abruptly, made his
face blank. &ldquo;Teach you to swim? I&rsquo;ll hold you up in the water with
the Power. <em>Saidin</em> is tainted, you know. The Dark One&rsquo;s
touch. You won&rsquo;t feel it, though. All around you, but you&rsquo;ll not
feel a thing.&rdquo; Another chuckle, with a hint of a wheeze. Her dark
eyes were as wide and round as they would go, her smile a sickly
rictus. &ldquo;Later, then. I want to be alone, to think about&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He
bent as if to kiss her, and with a squeak, she dropped a curtsy so
sudden that at first he thought her legs had collapsed.</p>

<p>Backing away, curtsying hurriedly at every other
step, she babbled about the honor of serving him, her deepest wish
to serve him, all in a voice on the brink of hysteria, until she
bumped into one of the square arches. A final, half-bend of her
knees, and she darted inside.</p>

<p>With a grimace, he turned back to the railing.
Frightening women. She would have made excuses had he asked her to
leave him, would have taken a command as only a temporary setback
unless it was to stay out of his sight, and even then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Maybe
word would spread this time. He had to keep a short rein on his
temper; it ran away too easily of late. It was the drought he could
do nothing about, the problems that sprang up like weeds wherever
he looked. A few moments more alone with his pipe. Who would rule a
nation when he could have easier work, such as carrying water
uphill in a sieve?</p>

<p>Across the garden, between two of the Royal Palace&rsquo;s
stepped towers, he had a view of Cairhien, harshly lit and
shadowed, mastering the hills more than flowing over them. His
crimson flag with the ancient Aes Sedai symbol hung limply above
one of those two towers, a long copy of the Dragon Banner over the
other. That one flew a dozen places in the city, including the
tallest of the great unfinished towers, right in front of him.
Shouting had done as little as orders there; neither Tairens nor
Cairhienin could believe he really meant that he only wanted one,
and Aiel did not care about banners one way or another.</p>

<p>Even now, deep inside the palace, he could hear the
murmur of a city jammed to bursting. Refugees from every corner of
the land, more afraid to return to their homes than they were to
have the Dragon Reborn in their midst. Merchants seeping in,
selling whatever people could afford to buy and buying whatever
people could not afford to keep. Lords and armed men rallying to
his banner, or to someone&rsquo;s. Hunters for the Horn thinking it must
be found near him; a dozen Foregaters, or a hundred, were ready to
sell it to any of them. Ogier stonemasons down from Stedding Tsofu
to see if there was work for their fabled skills. Adventurers, some
of whom might have been bandits a week gone, come to see what they
could pick up. There had even been a hundred or so Whitecloaks,
though they had galloped out as soon as it was clear the siege had
been lifted. Did Pedron Niall&rsquo;s ingathering of the Whitecloaks
concern him? Egwene gave him hints of things, but she saw matters
from the White Tower, wherever she stood. The Aes Sedai point of
view was not his.</p>

<p>At least the wagon trains full of grain were
beginning to arrive from Tear with some regularity. Hungry people
could riot. He wished he could have simply left it at being glad
they were not so hungry anymore, but there it was. The bandits were
fewer. And the civil war had not resumed. Yet. More good news. He
had to make certain it stayed that way before he could leave. A
hundred things to take care of before he could go after Sammael.
Only Rhuarc and Bael remained of the chiefs he really trusted,
those who had marched from Rhuidean with him. But if the four clans
who had joined him late could not be trusted on the march to Tear,
could he trust them loose in Cairhien? Indirian and the others had
acknowledged him as <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, but they knew him as
little as he knew them. The message that morning might be a
problem. Berelain, First of Mayene, was only a few hundred miles
south of the city, on her way to join him with a small army; he had
no idea how she had led it across Tear. Oddly, her letter had asked
if Perrin was with him. No doubt she feared Rand might forget her
small country if she did not remind him. It might almost be a
pleasure to watch her spar with the Cairhienin, the latest in a
long line of Firsts who had managed to keep Tear from swallowing
their country by playing the Game of Houses. Perhaps if he put her
in charge here&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He would be taking Meilan and the other
Tairens with him when the time came. If it ever came.</p>

<p>This was no better than what was waiting inside.
Tapping the dottle from his pipe, he ground out the tabac&rsquo;s last
sparks under his boot. No need to risk fire to the garden; it would
go up like a torch. The drought. The unnatural weather. He realized
he was snarling silently. First work on what he knew he could do
something about. It took an effort to smooth his face before he
went in.</p>

<p>Asmodean, as well dressed as any lord, with falls of
lace at his neck, plucked a soothing melody from his harp in one
corner, leaning against the dark severe paneling as if lounging at
his leisure. The others who were sitting bobbed out of their chairs
at Rand&rsquo;s appearance, and back down at his sharp gesture. Meilan,
Torean and Aracome occupied carved-and-gilded chairs on one side of
the deep red and gold carpet, each with a young Tairen lord at his
back, mirroring the Cairhienin on the other side. Dobraine and
Maringil had a young lord apiece behind them, too, each with the
front of his head shaved and powdered like Dobraine&rsquo;s. A
white-faced Selande stood at Colavaere&rsquo;s shoulder, and trembled
when Rand looked at her.</p>

<p>Schooling his face, he strode down the carpet to his
own chair. That chair alone was reason to control his features. It
was a new gift from Colavaere and the other two, in what they
imagined was the Tairen style. He must like Tairen gaudiness; he
ruled Tear, had sent them here. Carved Dragons held it up, all
sparkling red and gold with enamel and gilt, and great sunstones
for their golden eyes. Two more made the arms, and others climbed
the tall back. Countless craftsmen must have gone without sleep
since his arrival to make the thing. He felt like a fool sitting on
it. Asmodean&rsquo;s music had changed; it had a grand sound, now, a
triumphal march.</p>

<p>And yet, there was an added wariness in those dark
Cairhienin eyes watching him, a wariness reflected in the Tairens.
It had been there before he went outside, too. Perhaps in
attempting to curry favor they had made a mistake that was only now
dawning on them. They had all tried to ignore who he was, pretend
he was simply some young lord who had conquered them, who could be
dealt with and manipulated. That chair&mdash;that throne&mdash;held up in front of them who and what he really was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are the soldiers moving on schedule, Lord Dobraine?&rdquo;
The harp faded away as soon as he opened his mouth, Asmodean
apparently absorbed in tuning it.</p>

<p>The leathery man smiled grimly. &ldquo;They are, my Lord
Dragon.&rdquo; No more than that. Rand had no illusions that Dobraine
liked him more than any of the others did, or that he would not try
to gain advantage where he could, but Dobraine actually seemed
ready to hold to the oath he had sworn. The colorful slashes down
the chest of his coat were worn from a breastplate being buckled
over them.</p>

<p>Maringil shifted forward on his chair, whip-slender
and tall for a Cairhienin, white hair almost touching his
shoulders. His forehead was not shaved, and his coat, stripes
nearly to his knees, bore no visible wear. &ldquo;We need those men here,
my Lord Dragon.&rdquo; Hawk&rsquo;s eyes blinked at the gilded throne, focused
on Rand again. &ldquo;There are many bandits at large in the land yet.&rdquo;
He shifted again, so he did not have to look at the Tairens. Meilan
and the other two were smiling faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have set Aiel to hunting bandits,&rdquo; Rand said. They
did have orders to sweep up any brigands in their path. And to not
go out of their way to find them. Even Aiel could not do that and
move quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m told that three days ago, Stone Dogs killed
nearly two hundred near Morelle.&rdquo; That was near the southernmost
line claimed by Cairhien in recent years, halfway to the River
Iralell. No need to let this lot know that those Aiel might be as
far as the river by now. They could cover long distances faster
than horses.</p>

<p>Maringil persisted, frowning uneasily. &ldquo;There is
another reason. Half of our land west of the Alguenya is in the
hands of Andor.&rdquo; He hesitated. They all knew Rand had grown up in
Andor; a dozen rumors made him a son of one Andoran House or
another, even a son of Morgase herself, either cast off because he
could channel or fled before he could be gentled. The slender man
went on as if tiptoeing barefoot and blindfolded among daggers.
&ldquo;Morgase does not seem to be reaching for more as yet, but what she
has already must be taken back. Her heralds have even proclaimed
her right to the&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped abruptly. None of them knew who
Rand meant the Sun Throne for. Maybe it was Morgase.</p>

<p>Colavaere&rsquo;s dark gaze had Rand on balance scales
again; she had said little today. She would not until she learned
why Selande&rsquo;s face was so white.</p>

<p>Suddenly Rand was tired, of nobles balking, of all
the maneuvering in <em>Daes Dae&rsquo;mar</em>. &ldquo;Andoran claims to
Cairhien will be taken care of when I am ready. Those soldiers will
go to Tear. You will follow the High Lord Meilan&rsquo;s good example of
obedience, and I&rsquo;ll hear no more on it.&rdquo; He swung toward the
Tairens. &ldquo;Your example is a good one, Meilan, isn&rsquo;t it? And yours,
Aracome? If I ride out tomorrow, I won&rsquo;t find a thousand Defenders
of the Stone camped ten miles south who were supposed to be on
their way back to Tear two days ago, will I? Or two thousand
armsmen from Tairen Houses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those faint smiles faded with each word. Meilan
became very still, dark eyes glittering, and Aracome&rsquo;s narrow face
went pale, whether from anger or fear it was hard to say. Torean
dabbed at his lumpy face with a silk handkerchief pulled from his
sleeve. Rand ruled in Tear, and meant to rule; <em>Callandor</em>
driven into the Heart of the Stone proved that. That was why they
had not protested against his sending Cairhienin soldiers to Tear.
They thought to carve new estates, perhaps kingdoms, here, far from
where he ruled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not, my Lord Dragon,&rdquo; Meilan said finally.
&ldquo;Tomorrow I will ride with you so you may see for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand did not doubt it. A rider would be dispatched
south as soon as the man could arrange it, and by tomorrow those
soldiers would be far on toward Tear. It would do. For now. &ldquo;I am
done, then. You may leave me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few starts of surprise, masked so quickly they
might have been imagined, and they were rising, bowing and
curtsying, Selande and the young lords backing away. They had
expected more. An audience with the Dragon Reborn was always long,
and tortuous as they saw it, with him firmly bending them the way
he meant them to go, whether it was declaring that no Tairen could
claim lands in Cairhien without marrying into a Cairhienin House,
or refusing to allow the expulsion of Foregaters, or making laws
apply to nobles that had never applied to any but commoners
before.</p>

<p>His eyes followed Selande for a moment. She was not
the first in the last ten days. Nor the tenth, or even the
twentieth. He had been tempted, at least at first. When he rejected
slender, plump promptly replaced her, as tall or dark, for
Cairhienin anyway, replaced short or fair. A constant search for
the woman who would please him. The Maidens turned back those who
tried to sneak into his quarters at night, firmly but more gently
than Aviendha had handled the one she caught. Aviendha apparently
took Elayne&rsquo;s ownership of him with little short of deadly
seriousness. Yet her Aiel sense of humor seemed to find tormenting
him very satisfying; he had seen the satisfaction on her face when
he groaned and hid his face as she started undressing for the
night. Thus he could have resented her deadly seriousness if he had
not quickly understood what was behind that string of pretty young
women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lady Colavaere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stopped as soon as he spoke her name, cool-eyed
and calm beneath her ornate tower of dark curls. Selande had no
choice but to remain with her, though she was plainly as reluctant
to stay as the others were to go. Meilan and Maringil bowed
themselves out last, so intent on Colavaere and trying to puzzle
out why she had been called to stay that they did not realize they
were side by side. Their eyes were a perfect match, dark and
predatory.</p>

<p>The dark-paneled door closed. &ldquo;Selande is very pretty
young woman,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;But some prefer the company of a more
mature&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;more knowledgeable&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;woman. You will sup alone
with me tonight, when Second Even is rung. I look forward to the
pleasure.&rdquo; He waved her away before she could say anything, if she
could have. Her face did not change, but her curtsy was a trifle
unsteady. Selande looked purely amazed. And infinitely
relieved.</p>

<p>Once the door had closed again, behind the two women,
Rand threw back his head and laughed. A harsh, sardonic laugh. He
was tired of the Game of Houses, so he played it without thinking.
He was disgusted with himself for frightening one woman, so he
frightened another. It was reason enough to laugh. Colavaere stood
behind that line of young women who had been flinging themselves at
him. Find a bed-partner for the Lord Dragon, a young woman whose
strings she pulled, and Colavaere would have a string tied firmly
to Rand. But it was some other woman she meant to bed, and perhaps
even marry, the Dragon Reborn. Now she would sweat all the hours
until Second Even. She had to know she was pretty, if short of
beautiful, and if he rebuffed all the young women she sent, perhaps
it was because he wanted one with another fifteen or so years. And
she would be certain she did not dare say no to the man who held
Cairhien in his fist. By tonight, she should be amenable, should
stop this idiocy. Aviendha would very likely slit the throat of any
woman she found in his bed; besides, he had no time for all these
easily frightened doves thinking to sacrifice themselves for
Cairhien and Colavaere. There were too many problems to deal with,
and no time.</p>

<p><em>Light, what if Colavaere decides it&rsquo;s worth the
sacrifice?</em> She might. She was easily cold-blooded enough. <em>
Then I&rsquo;ll have to see that it&rsquo;s cold with fear</em>. It would not
be difficult. He could sense <em>saidin</em> like something just
beyond the edge of sight. He could feel the taint on it. Sometimes
he thought that what he felt was the taint in him, now, the dregs
left by <em>saidin</em>.</p>

<p>He found that he was glaring at Asmodean. The man
seemed to be studying him, face expressionless. The music resumed
again, like water babbling over stones, soothing. So he needed
soothing, did he?</p>

<p>The door opened without a knock, admitting Moiraine,
Egwene and Aviendha together, the younger women&rsquo;s Aiel garb framing
the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s pale blue. For anyone else, even Rhuarc or another
chief still near the city or yet another delegation of Wise Ones, a
Maiden would have entered to announce them. These three the Maidens
sent on in even if he was taking a bath. Egwene glanced at &ldquo;Natael&rdquo;
and grimaced, and the tune became lower, and for a moment
intricate, perhaps a dance, before settling to what might have been
the sighing of breezes. The man wore a twisted smile, directed at
his harp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised to see you, Egwene,&rdquo; Rand said. He
swung his leg over the arm of the chair. &ldquo;What is it&mdash;six
days you&rsquo;ve been avoiding me? Have you brought me more good news?
Has Masema sacked Amador in my name? Or have these Aes Sedai you
say support me turned out to be Black Ajah? You notice I don&rsquo;t ask
who they are, or where. Not even how you know. I don&rsquo;t ask you to
divulge Aes Sedai secrets, or Wise Ones&rsquo; secrets, or whatever they
are. Just give me the driblets you&rsquo;re willing to dole out, and let
me worry whether what you don&rsquo;t care to tell me will stab me in the
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him calmly. &ldquo;You know what you need to
know. And I will not tell you what you do not need to know.&rdquo; That
was what she had said six days ago. She was as much Aes Sedai as
Moiraine, for all one wore Aiel garb and the other pale blue
silk.</p>

<p>There was nothing calm about Aviendha. She moved to
stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Egwene, green eyes flashing, back
so straight it might have been iron. He was half surprised Moiraine
did not join them, so they could all three glare at him. Her vow of
obedience left a startling amount of room, it seemed, and the three
seemed to have become close since his argument with Egwene. Not
that it had been much of an argument; you could not argue very well
with a woman who watched with cool eyes, never raised her voice,
and after one refusal to answer declined even to acknowledge your
question again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These came for you in the last hour,&rdquo; Moiraine said,
extending two folded letters. Her voice seemed to fit Asmodean&rsquo;s
chime-like tune.</p>

<p>Rand rose to take them suspiciously. &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re for
me, how did they come into your hands?&rdquo; One was addressed to &ldquo;Rand
al&rsquo;Thor&rdquo; in an exact, angular hand, the other to &ldquo;The Lord Dragon
Reborn&rdquo; in script flowing yet no less precise. The seals were
unbroken. A second look made him blink. The two seals seemed to be
the same red wax, and one bore the impression of the Flame of Tar
Valon, the other a tower overlaid on what he recognized as the
island of Tar Valon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps because of where they came from,&rdquo; Moiraine
replied, &ldquo;and from whom.&rdquo; It was no explanation, but it was as much
as he would get unless he demanded more. Even then he would have to
prod her through every step. She kept her vow, but in her own way.
&ldquo;There are no poison needles in the seals. And no traps woven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused with his thumb against the Flame of Tar
Valon&mdash;he had not thought of either&mdash;then broke it.
Another Flame in red wax stood beside the signature, Elaida do
Avriny a&rsquo;Roihan in a hasty scrawl above her titles. The rest was in
the angular hand.</p>

<p class="note">There can be no denial that you are the one
prophesied, yet many will try to destroy you for what else you are.
For the sake of the world, this can not be allowed. Two nations
have bent knee to you, and the savage Aiel as well, but the power
of thrones is as dust beside the One Power. The White Tower will
shelter and protect you against those who refuse to see what must
be. The White Tower will see that you live to see Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don.
None else can do this. An escort of Aes Sedai will come to bring
you to Tar Valon with the honor and respect you deserve. This I
pledge to you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t even ask,&rdquo; he said wryly. He remembered
Elaida well for having met her only once. A woman hard enough to
make Moiraine seem a kitten. The &ldquo;honor and respect&rdquo; he deserved.
He would wager that the escort of Aes Sedai just happened to number
thirteen.</p>

<p>Passing Elaida&rsquo;s letter back to Moiraine, he opened
the other. The page was covered in the same hand that had addressed
it.</p>

<p class="note">With respect, I humbly beg to make myself known
to the great Lord Dragon Reborn, whom the Light blesses as savior
of the world.</p>

<p class="note">All the world must stand in awe of you, who has
conquered Cairhien in one day as you did Tear. Yet be wary, I
beseech you, for your splendor will inspire jealousy even in those
not toiled in the Shadow. Even here in the White Tower are the
blind who cannot see your true radiance, which will illumine us
all. Yet know that some rejoice in your coming, and will delight to
serve your glory. We are not those who would steal your luster for
ourselves, but rather those who would kneel to bask in your
brilliance. You shall save the world, according to the Prophecies,
and the world shall be yours.</p>

<p class="note">To my shame, I must beg you to let no one see
these words, and to destroy them when once read. I stand, naked of
your protection, among some who would usurp your power, and I
cannot know who around you is as faithful as I. I am told that
Moiraine Damodred may be with you. She may serve you devotedly,
obeying your words as law, as I will, yet I cannot know, for I
remember her as a secretive woman, much given to plotting, as
Cairhienin are. Yet even if you believe she is your creature, as I
do, I beg you to keep this missive secret, even from her. My life
lies beneath your fingers, my Lord Dragon Reborn, and I am your
servant.</p>

<p class="note_sig"><em>Alviarin Freidhen</p>

<p>He read it through again, blinking, then handed it to
Moiraine. She barely scanned the page before giving it to Egwene,
who had her head over the other letter with Aviendha. Perhaps
Moiraine already knew what they contained?</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good thing you gave your oath,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The way
you used to be, keeping everything back, I might have been ready to
suspect you by now. A good thing you&rsquo;re more open now.&rdquo; She did not
react. &ldquo;What do you make of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must have heard about your swelled head,&rdquo; Egwene
said softly. He did not think he had been meant to hear. Shaking
her head, she said more loudly, &ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t sound like Alviarin
at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is her hand,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;What do <em>
you</em> make of it, Rand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s a rift in the Tower, whether Elaida
knows it or not. I assume an Aes Sedai can&rsquo;t write a lie more
easily than she can speak one?&rdquo; He did not wait for her nod. &ldquo;If
Alviarin had been less flowery, I might have thought they were
working together to pull me in. I can&rsquo;t see Elaida even thinking
half of what Alviarin wrote, and I can&rsquo;t see her having a Keeper
who could write it, not if she knew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not going to do this thing,&rdquo; Aviendha said,
Elaida&rsquo;s letter crumpled in her hand. It was not a question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes you are not,&rdquo; she said grudgingly, and
made it worse by raising a questioning eyebrow to Egwene, who
considered for a moment, then shrugged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see anything else?&rdquo; Moiraine asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see White Tower spies,&rdquo; he told her dryly. &ldquo;They
know I hold the city.&rdquo; For at least two or three days after the
battle, the Shaido would have stopped anything but a pigeon going
north. Even a rider who knew where to change horses, no sure thing
between Cairhien and Tar Valon, could not have reached the Tower in
time for these letters to come back today.</p>

<p>Moiraine smiled. &ldquo;You learn quickly. You will do
well.&rdquo; For a moment she almost looked fond. &ldquo;What will you do about
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, except make sure that Elaida&rsquo;s &lsquo;escort&rsquo;
doesn&rsquo;t get within a mile of me.&rdquo; Thirteen of the weakest Aes Sedai
could overwhelm him linked, and he did not think Elaida would send
her weakest. &ldquo;That, and be aware that the Tower knows what I do the
day after I do it. Nothing more until I know more. Could Alviarin
be one of your mysterious friends, Egwene?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hesitated, and he suddenly wondered whether she
had told Moiraine any more than she had him. Was it Aes Sedai
secrets she kept, or Wise Ones&rsquo;? At last she said simply, &ldquo;I do not
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A rap came at the door, and Somara put her flaxen
head into the room. &ldquo;Matrim Cauthon has come, <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>.
He says that you sent for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Four hours ago, as soon as he had learned Mat was
back in the city. What would the excuse be this time? It was time
to be done with excuses. &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; he told the women. Wise Ones made
Mat almost as uneasy as Aes Sedai did; these three would put him
off balance. He did not give a second thought to using them. He was
going to use Mat, too. &ldquo;Send him in, Somara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat strolled into the room grinning, as if it was a
common room. His green coat hung open, and his shirt was half
unlaced, exposing the silver foxhead dangling on his sweaty chest,
but the dark silk scarf was draped around his neck to hide his
hanging scar in spite of the heat. &ldquo;Sorry if I took too long. There
were some Cairhienin who thought they knew how to play cards.
Doesn&rsquo;t he know anything livelier?&rdquo; he asked, jerking his head
toward Asmodean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;that every young man who can
pick up a sword wants to join the Band of the Red Hand. Talmanes
and Nalesean are having to turn them away in droves. And Daerid has
doubled the number of his footmen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat paused in lowering himself into the chair Aracome
had used. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. A fine lot of young&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;fellows wanting to
be heroes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Band of the Red Hand,&rdquo; Moiraine murmured.
&ldquo;<em>Shen an Calhar</em>. A legendary group of heroes indeed,
though the men in it must have changed many times in a war that
lasted well over three hundred years. It is said they were the last
to fall to the Trollocs, guarding Aemon himself, when Manetheren
died. Legend says a spring rose where they fell, to mark their
passing, but I rather think the spring was already there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know about that.&rdquo; Mat touched the foxhead
medallion, and his voice picked up strength. &ldquo;Some fool got the
name from somewhere, and they all started using it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine glanced at the medallion dismissively. The
small blue stone hanging on the forehead seemed to catch the light
and glow, though the angles were wrong. &ldquo;You are very brave, it
seems, Mat.&rdquo; It was flatly said, and the silence that followed
stiffened his face. &ldquo;Very brave,&rdquo; she said finally, &ldquo;to lead <em>
Shen an Calhar</em> across the Alguenya and south against the
Andorans. Even braver than that, for there are rumors that you went
alone to scout the way, and Talmanes and Nalesean had to ride hard
to catch up to you.&rdquo; Egwene sniffed loudly in the background.
&ldquo;Hardly wise for a young lord leading his men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat&rsquo;s lip curled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no lord; I&rsquo;ve more respect for
myself than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But very brave,&rdquo; Moiraine said as if he had not
spoken. &ldquo;Andoran supply wagons burned, outposts destroyed. And
three battles. Three battles, and three victories. With small loss
to your own men, though outnumbered.&rdquo; As she fingered a rip in the
shoulder of his coat he sank back as far the chair would allow.
&ldquo;Are you drawn to the thick of battles, or are they drawn to you? I
am almost surprised you came back. To hear the stories, you might
have driven the Andorans back across the Erinin had you
stayed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think this is funny?&rdquo; Mat snarled. &ldquo;If you
have something to say, say it. You can play the cat all you want,
but I&rsquo;m no mouse.&rdquo; For an instant his eyes flickered toward Egwene
and Aviendha, watching with folded arms, and he fingered the silver
foxhead again. He had to be wondering. It had stopped one woman&rsquo;s
channeling from touching him. Would it stop three?</p>

<p>Rand only watched. Watched his friend being softened
for what he meant to do to him. <em>Is there anything left to me
but necessity?</em> It was a quick thought, there and gone. He
would do what he must.</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s voice gained a rime of crystal frost
as she spoke, almost in an echo. &ldquo;We all do as we must, as the
Pattern decrees. For some there is less freedom than for others. It
does not matter whether we choose or are chosen. What must be, must
be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat did not look softened at all. Wary, yes, and
certainly angry, but not softened. He could have been a tomcat
backed into a corner by three hounds. A tomcat who meant to go down
hard. He seemed to have forgotten anyone was in the room except for
himself and the three women. &ldquo;You always have to push a man where
you want him, don&rsquo;t you? Kick him there, if he won&rsquo;t go led by the
nose. Blood and bloody ashes! Don&rsquo;t glare at me, Egwene, I&rsquo;ll speak
the way I want. Burn me! All it needs is for Nynaeve to be here,
yanking her braid out of her head, and Elayne staring down her
nose. Well, I&rsquo;m glad she isn&rsquo;t, to hear the news, but even if you
had Nynaeve, I&rsquo;d not be shoved&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What news?&rdquo; Rand said sharply. &ldquo;News Elayne
shouldn&rsquo;t hear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat looked up at Moiraine. &ldquo;You mean there&rsquo;s
something you haven&rsquo;t ferreted out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What news, Mat?&rdquo; Rand demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morgase is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene gasped, clasping both hands to her mouth below
eyes like huge circles. Moiraine whispered something that might
have been a prayer. Asmodean&rsquo;s fingers never faltered on the
harp.</p>

<p>Rand felt as if his belly had been ripped out. <em>
Elayne, forgive me</em>. And a faint echo, altered. <em>Ilyena,
forgive me</em>. &ldquo;Are you certain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As certain as I can be without seeing the body. It
seems Gaebril has been named King of Andor. And Cairhien, too, for
that matter. Supposedly Morgase did it. Something about the times
needing a strong man&rsquo;s hand or some such, as if anybody could have
a stronger than Morgase herself. Only, those Andorans down south
have heard rumors that she hasn&rsquo;t been seen in weeks. More than
rumors. You tell me what it adds up to. Andor&rsquo;s never had a king,
but now it has one, and the queen&rsquo;s vanished. Gaebril&rsquo;s the one
wanted Elayne killed. I tried to tell her that, but you know how
she always knows more than a mudfooted farmer. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d
balk a second at slitting a queen&rsquo;s throat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand discovered that he was sitting in one of the
chairs across from Mat, though he did not remember moving. Aviendha
laid a hand on his shoulder. Concern tightened her eyes. &ldquo;I am all
right,&rdquo; he said roughly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to send for Somara.&rdquo; Her
face reddened, but he hardly noticed.</p>

<p>Elayne would never be able to forgive him. He had
known that Rahvin&mdash;Gaebril&mdash;held Morgase prisoner, but
he had ignored it because the Forsaken might expect him to help
her. He had gone his own way, to do what they did not expect. And
ended chasing Couladin instead of doing what he planned. He had
known, and concentrated his attention on Sammael. Because the man
taunted him. Morgase could wait while he smashed Sammael&rsquo;s trap and
Sammael with it. And so Morgase was dead. Elayne&rsquo;s mother was dead.
Elayne would curse him to her deathbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing,&rdquo; Mat was going on. &ldquo;There
are a lot of queen&rsquo;s men down there. They are not so sure about
fighting for a king. You find Elayne. Half of them will flock to
you to put her on the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Rand barked. He quivered so hard with fury
that Egwene stepped back, and even Moiraine eyed him carefully.
Aviendha&rsquo;s hand tightened on his shoulder, but he shook it off as
he stood. Morgase dead because he had done nothing. His own
hand had been on the knife as surely as Rahvin&rsquo;s. Elayne. &ldquo;She
will be avenged. Rahvin, Mat. Not Gaebril. Rahvin. I&rsquo;ll lay him by
the heels if I never do another thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, blood and bloody ashes!&rdquo; Mat groaned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is madness.&rdquo; Egwene flinched as if realizing
what she had said, but she kept that firm, calm voice. &ldquo;You have
your hands full with Cairhien yet, not to mention the Shaido to the
north and whatever it is you&rsquo;re planning in Tear. Do you mean to
start another war, with two on your plate already and a ruined land
besides?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a war. Me. I can be in Caemlyn in an hour. A
raid&mdash;right, Mat?&mdash;a raid, not a war. I&rsquo;ll rip Rahvin&rsquo;s
heart out.&rdquo; His voice was a hammer. He felt as if acid filled his
veins. &ldquo;I could wish I had Elaida&rsquo;s thirteen sisters to take with
me, to smother him, and bring him to justice. Tried and hanged for
murder. That would be justice. But he&rsquo;ll just have to die however I
can kill him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; Moiraine said softly.</p>

<p>Rand glared at her. But she was right. Tomorrow would
be better. A night to let his rage cool. He needed to be cold when
he faced Rahvin. Now he wanted to seize <em>saidin</em> and lay
about him, destroying. Asmodean&rsquo;s music had changed again, to a
tune that street musicians in the city had played during the civil
war. You could still hear it sometimes when a Cairhienin noble
passed. &ldquo;The Fool Who Thought He Was King.&rdquo; &ldquo;Get out, Natael. Get
out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Asmodean straightened smoothly, bowing, but his face
could have done for snow, and he crossed the room quickly, as if
uncertain what one second more might bring. He always pushed, but
perhaps this time he had pushed too far. As he opened the door,
Rand spoke again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will see you tonight. Or I will see you dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Asmodean&rsquo;s bow was not so graceful this time. &ldquo;As my
Lord Dragon commands,&rdquo; he said hoarsely, and hurriedly pulled the
door shut with him on the other side.</p>

<p>The three women looked at Rand, expressionless, not
blinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rest of you go, too.&rdquo; Mat practically bounded
toward the door. &ldquo;Not you. I have things to say to you yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat stopped short, sighing loudly and fiddling with
his medallion. He was the only one who had moved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not have thirteen Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Aviendha said,
&ldquo;but you have two. And myself. I may not know as much as Moiraine
Sedai, but I am as strong as Egwene, and I am no stranger to the
dance.&rdquo; She meant the dance of spears, what the Aiel called
battle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rahvin is mine,&rdquo; he told her quietly. Maybe Elayne
could forgive him a little if he at least avenged her mother.
Probably not, but maybe he could forgive himself. A little. He
forced his hands to stay at his sides, to not make fists.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you draw a line on the ground for him to step
over?&rdquo; Egwene asked. &ldquo;Put a chip on your shoulder? Have you
considered that Rahvin might not be alone if he calls himself King
of Andor now? Much good it will do when you appear if one of his
guards puts an arrow through your heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could remember wishing she would not shout at him,
but it had been so much easier then. &ldquo;Did you think I meant to go
alone?&rdquo; He had; he had never thought of anyone to guard his back,
though now he could hear a small whisper, <em>He likes to come from
behind, or at your flanks</em>. He could hardly think clearly at
all. His anger seemed to have a life of its own, stoking the fires
that kept it boiling. &ldquo;But not you. This is dangerous. Moiraine can
come if she wishes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene and Aviendha did not look at one another
before stepping forward, but they moved as one, not stopping until
they were so close even Aviendha had to tilt her bead back to look
up at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moiraine can come if she wishes,&rdquo; Egwene said.</p>

<p>If her voice was smooth ice, Aviendha&rsquo;s was molten
stone. &ldquo;But it is too dangerous for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you become my father? Is your name Bran
al&rsquo;Vere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have three spears, do you put two aside
because they are newer made?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not want to risk you,&rdquo; he said stiffly.</p>

<p>Egwene arched her eyebrows. &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; That was all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> to you.&rdquo; Aviendha bared
her teeth. &ldquo;You will never choose what risks I take, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.
Never. Know it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What? Wrap them in <em>saidin</em> and
leave them? He still could not shield them. So they might well
snare him in return. A fine mess, all because they wanted to be
stubborn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have thought of guards,&rdquo; Moiraine said, &ldquo;but
what if who is with Rahvin is Semirhage, or Graendal? Or Lanfear?
These two might overwhelm one such, but could you face her and
Rahvin together alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There had been something in her voice when she said
Lanfear&rsquo;s name. Was she afraid that if Lanfear was there, he might
finally join her? What would he do if she was there? What could he
do? &ldquo;They can come,&rdquo; he said through clenched teeth. &ldquo;Now will you
go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you command,&rdquo; Moiraine said, but they were in no
hurry about it. Aviendha and Egwene took ostentatious care in
rearranging their shawls before they started for the door. Lords
and ladies might dart at his word, but never them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not try to talk me out of it,&rdquo; he said
abruptly.</p>

<p>He meant it for Moiraine, but Egwene spoke first,
though to Aviendha, and with a smile. &ldquo;Stopping a man from what he
wants to do is like taking a sweet from a child. Sometimes you have
to do it, but sometimes it just isn&rsquo;t worth the trouble.&rdquo; Aviendha
nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills,&rdquo; was Moiraine&rsquo;s
reply. She stood in the doorway looking more Aes Sedai than he ever
remembered her, ageless, with dark eyes that seemed ready to
swallow him, slight and slender yet so regal she could have
commanded a roomful of queens if she could not channel a spark.
That blue stone on her forehead was catching the light again. &ldquo;You
will do well, Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stared at the door long after it closed behind
them.</p>

<p>It was a scuff of boots that recalled him to Mat&rsquo;s
presence. Mat was trying to slide toward the door, moving slowly so
as not to be seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need to talk to you, Mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat grimaced. Touching the foxhead like a talisman,
he spun to face Rand. &ldquo;If you think I&rsquo;m going to put my head on the
block just because those fool women did, you can forget it now. I&rsquo;m
no bloody hero, and I don&rsquo;t want to be one. Morgase was a pretty
woman&mdash;I even liked her; as much as you can like a queen&mdash;but Rahvin is Rahvin, burn you, and I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up and listen. You have to stop running.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn me if I will! This is no game I chose, and I
won&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said, shut up!&rdquo; Rand drove the foxhead against
Mat&rsquo;s chest with a hard finger. &ldquo;I know where you got this. I was
there, remember? I cut the rope you were hanging from. I don&rsquo;t know
exactly what got shoved into your head, but whatever it is, I need
it. The clan chiefs know war, but somehow you know it too, and
maybe better. I need that! So this is what you&rsquo;re going to do, you
and the Band of the Red Hand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">&ldquo;Be careful tomorrow,&rdquo; Moiraine said.</p>

<p>Egwene paused at the door to her room. &ldquo;Of course
we&rsquo;ll be careful.&rdquo; Her stomach was turning backflips, but she kept
her voice steady. &ldquo;We know how dangerous facing one of the Forsaken
will be.&rdquo; By Aviendha&rsquo;s expression, they might have been talking
about what was for supper. But then, she was never afraid of
anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you, now,&rdquo; Moiraine murmured. &ldquo;Be very careful
anyway, whether you think one of the Forsaken is near or not. Rand
will need both of you in the days to come. You handle his temper
well&mdash;though I may say your methods are unusual. He will need
people who cannot be driven away or quelled by his rages, who will
tell him what he must hear instead of what they think he wants
to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do that, Moiraine,&rdquo; Egwene told her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. But he will still need you. Rest well.
Tomorrow will be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;difficult for us all.&rdquo; She glided away down
the corridor, passing from dimness to pool of lamplight to dimness.
Night was already coming to these shadowed halls, and oil was in
short supply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you stay with me awhile, Aviendha?&rdquo; Egwene
asked. &ldquo;I feel more like talking than eating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must tell Amys what I have promised to do
tomorrow. And I must be in Rand al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s sleeping chamber when he
comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne can never complain that you haven&rsquo;t watched
Rand closely for her. Did you really drag the Lady Berwyn down the
hall by her hair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha&rsquo;s cheeks colored faintly. &ldquo;Do you think
these Aes Sedai in&mdash;Salidar?&mdash;will help him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful of that name, Aviendha. Rand cannot be
allowed to find them without preparation.&rdquo; The way he was now, they
would be more likely to gentle him, or at least send thirteen
sisters of their own, than help him. She would have to stand
between them in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, she and Nynaeve and
Elayne, and hope those Aes Sedai had committed themselves too far
to back out before they discovered how near the brink he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be careful. Rest well. And eat well tonight.
In the morning, eat nothing. It is not good to dance the spears
with a full stomach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene watched her stride away before pressing her
hands to her stomach. She did not think she would eat tonight or in
the morning. Rahvin. And maybe Lanfear, or one of the others.
Nynaeve had faced Moghedien and won. But Nynaeve was stronger than
she or Aviendha, when she could channel at all. There might not be
another. Rand said the Forsaken did not trust one another. She
could almost wish he was wrong, or at least that he was not so
certain. It was frightening when she thought she saw another man
looking through his eyes, heard another man&rsquo;s words come out of his
mouth. It should not be so; everyone was reborn as the Wheel
turned. But everyone was not the Dragon Reborn. Moiraine would not
talk of it. What would Rand do if Lanfear was there? Lanfear
had loved Lews Therin Telamon, but what had the Dragon felt for
her? How much of Rand was still Rand?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will work yourself into a tizzy this way,&rdquo; she
said firmly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a child. Act like a woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When a serving woman brought her supper of snapbeans
and potatoes and fresh baked bread, she made herself eat. It tasted
like ashes.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Mat strode through the dimly lit corridors of the
palace and flung open the door of the rooms that had been set aside
for the young hero of the battle against the Shaido. Not that he
had spent much time there; hardly any. Servants had lit two of the
stand-lamps. Hero! He was no hero! What did a hero get? An Aes
Sedai patting you on the head before she sent you out like a hound
to do it again. A noblewoman condescending to favor you with a
kiss, or laying a flower on your grave. He stalked back and forth
in his anteroom, for once not pricing the flowered Illianer carpet
or the chairs and chests and tables gilded and inlaid with
ivory.</p>

<p>The stormy meeting with Rand had gone on till the sun
set, him dodging, refusing, Rand following as doggedly as Hawkwing
after the rout at Cole Pass. What was he to do? If he rode out
again, Talmanes and Nalesean would surely follow with as many men
as they could put in the saddle, expecting him to find another
battle. And he probably would; that was what really put a chill on
it. Much as he hated to admit it, the Aes Sedai was right. He was
drawn to battle or it to him. Nobody could have tried harder to
avoid one on the other side of the Alguenya. Even Talmanes had
commented on it. Until the second time his careful creeping away
from one lot of Andorans took them where there was no choice but to
fight another. And every time he could feel the dice rolling in his
head; it was almost like a warning that a fight was just over the
next hill, now.</p>

<p>There was always a ship, or might be, down at the
docks beside the grain barges. Hard to find yourself in a battle on
a ship in the middle of a river. Except the Andorans held one bank
of the Alguenya for half its length or more below the city. The way
his luck was running, the ship would run aground on the west bank
with half the Andoran army camped there.</p>

<p>That left doing what Rand wanted. He could just see
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morrow, High Lord Weiramon, and all you other
High Lords and Ladies. I&rsquo;m a gambler, a farmboy, and I&rsquo;m here to
take command of your bloody army! The bloody lord Dragon Reborn
will be with us as soon as he flaming takes care of one bloody
little matter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Snatching his black-hafted spear from the corner, he
hurled it the length of the room. It struck a wall hanging&mdash;a
hunting scene&mdash;and the stone wall behind with a loud <em>
clang</em>, then dropped to the floor, leaving the hunters neatly
sliced in two. Swearing, he hurried to pick it up. The two-foot
sword-blade was not chipped or marred. Of course not. Aes Sedai
work.</p>

<p>He fingered the ravens on the blade. &ldquo;Will I ever be
free of Aes Sedai work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Melindhra asked from the door.</p>

<p>He eyed her as he propped the spear against the wall,
and for a change it was not spun-gold hair or clear blue eyes or a
firm body that he thought of. It seemed that every Aiel went to the
river sooner or later, to stare silently at so much water in one
place, but Melindhra went every day, just about. &ldquo;Has Kadere found
ships yet?&rdquo; Kadere would not be going to Tar Valon on grain
barges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The peddler&rsquo;s wagons are still there. I do not know
about&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ships.&rdquo; She pronounced the unfamiliar word awkwardly.
&ldquo;Why do you wish to know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going away for a while. For Rand,&rdquo; he added
hastily. Her face was too still. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d take you with me if I could,
but you wouldn&rsquo;t want to leave the Maidens.&rdquo; A ship, or his own
horse? And to where? That was the question. He could reach Tear
quicker on a fast river ship than on Pips. If he was fool enough to
make that choice. If he had any choice.</p>

<p>Melindhra&rsquo;s mouth tightened briefly. To his surprise,
it was not over his leaving her. &ldquo;So you slip back into Rand
al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s shadow. You have gained much honor of your own, among the
Aiel as well as the wetlanders. Your honor, not honor reflected
from the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can keep his honor and take it to Caemlyn or the
Pit of Doom for all I care. Don&rsquo;t you worry. I&rsquo;ll find plenty of
honor. I will write you about it. From Tear.&rdquo; Tear? He would
never escape Rand, or Aes Sedai, if he made that choice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is going to Caemlyn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat suppressed a wince. He was not supposed to say
anything about that. Whatever he decided about the rest, he could
do that much. &ldquo;Just a name pulled from my pocket. Because of the
Andorans down south, I suppose. I wouldn&rsquo;t know where he&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had no warning. One instant she was just standing
there, the next her foot was in his middle, driving out breath,
doubling him over. Eyes bulging, he fought to keep his feet, to
straighten, to think. Why? She spun like a dancer, backwards, and
her other foot against the side of his head drove him staggering.
Without a pause she leaped straight up, kicking out, her soft
bootsole taking him hard flush in the face.</p>

<p>When his eyes cleared enough to see, he was on his
back, halfway across the room from her. He could feel blood on his
face. His head seemed stuffed with wool, and the room seemed to
rock. That was when he saw her take a knife from her pouch, slim
blade not much longer than her hand, gleaming in the lamplight.
Winding the <em>shoufa</em> around her head in a quick motion, she
raised the black veil across her face.</p>

<p>Groggily, he moved by instinct, without thinking. The
blade came out of his sleeve, left his hand as if floating through
jelly. Only then did he realize what he had done and stretch out
desperately, trying to snatch it back.</p>

<p>The hilt bloomed between her breasts. She sagged to
her knees, fell back.</p>

<p>Mat pushed himself up, wavering on hands and knees.
He could not have stood if his life hung on it, but he crawled to
her, muttering wildly. &ldquo;Why? Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He jerked her veil aside, and those clear blue eyes
focused on him. She even smiled. He did not look at the knife-hilt.
His knife-hilt. He knew where the heart was in a body. &ldquo;Why,
Melindhra?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always liked your pretty eyes,&rdquo; she breathed, so
faint he had to strain to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some oaths are more important than others, Mat
Cauthon.&rdquo; The slim-bladed knife came up swiftly, all her remaining
strength behind it, the point driving the dangling foxhead against
his chest. The silver medallion should not have stopped a blade,
but the angle was just that much wrong, and some hidden flaw in the
steel snapped the blade off right at the hilt just as he caught her
hand. &ldquo;You have the Great Lord&rsquo;s own luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Burn you, why?&rdquo; He knew there
would be no answer. Her mouth remained open, as though she might
say something more, but her eyes were already beginning to
glaze.</p>

<p>He started to pull the veil back up, to cover her
face and staring eyes, then let his hand fall. He had killed men,
and Trollocs, but never a woman. Never a woman until now. Women
were glad when he came into their lives. It was not boasting. Women
smiled for him; even when he left them, they smiled as if they
would welcome him back. That was all he ever really wanted from,
women; a smile, a dance, a kiss, and to be remembered fondly.</p>

<p>He realized his thoughts were babbling. Jerking the
bladeless hilt from Melindhra&rsquo;s hand&mdash;it was gold-mounted jade,
inlaid with golden bees&mdash;he hurled it into the marble
fireplace, hoping it shattered. He wanted to cry, to howl. <em>I
don&rsquo;t kill women! I kiss them, I don&rsquo;t</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>!</em></p>

<p>He had to think clearly. Why? Not because he was
leaving, surely. She had hardly reacted to that. Besides, she
thought he was chasing off after honor; she had always approved of
that. Something she had said tugged at him, and then came back,
with a chill. The Great Lord&rsquo;s own luck. He had heard it
differently, many times. The Dark One&rsquo;s own luck. &ldquo;A Darkfriend.&rdquo; A
question, or certainty? He wished the thought made what he had done
easier in his mind. He was going to carry her face to his
grave.</p>

<p>Tear. He had as much as told her he was going to
Tear. The dagger. Golden bees in jade. He would wager there were
nine without looking. Nine golden bees on a field of green. The
sign of Illian. Where Sammael ruled. Could Sammael be afraid of
him? How could Sammael even know? It was only a few hours since
Rand had asked Mat&mdash;told him&mdash;and he was not sure
himself what he was going to do. Maybe Sammael would not take the
chance? Right. One of the Forsaken, afraid of a gambler, however
stuffed with other men&rsquo;s battle knowledge his head might be. That
was ridiculous.</p>

<p>It all came down to this. He could believe that
Melindhra had not been a Darkfriend, that she had decided to kill
him on a whim, that there was no connection between a jade hilt
inlaid with golden bees and his maybe going to Tear to lead an army
against Illian. He could if he was a bull-goose fool. Better to err
toward caution, he always said. One of the Forsaken had noticed
him. He certainly was not standing in Rand&rsquo;s shadow now.</p>

<p>Sliding across the floor, he sat with his chin on his
knees and his back against the door, staring at Melindhra&rsquo;s face,
trying to decide what to do. When a servant knocked with his
supper, he shouted for her to go away. Food was the last thing he
wanted. What was he going to do? He wished he did not feel the dice
spinning in his head.</p>
