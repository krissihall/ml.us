<h4><em>Before the Arrow</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
inside of a tent roof had to be the most boring
sight in the world, but lying back in his shirtsleeves on
scarlet-tasseled cushions that Melindhra had acquired, Mat studied
the gray-brown cloth intently. Or rather, he stared beyond it. One
arm curled behind his head, he swirled a hammered-silver goblet
full of good wine from the south of Cairhien. A small cask had cost
him as much as two good horses would&mdash;as much as two horses
would have if the world and everything in it had not been stood on
its head&mdash;but he counted it a small price for something
decent. Sometimes a drop or two splashed over onto his hand, but he
never noticed and he never took a drink.</p>

<p>By his book, matters had long since gone beyond
merely serious. Serious was being stuck in the Waste with no idea
of the way out. Serious was Darkfriends popping up when you least
expected, Trolloc attacks in the night, the odd Myrddraal freezing
your blood with an eyeless stare. That sort of thing came quickly,
and usually was done before you had much chance to think. It was
certainly not what you would seek out, yet if you had to, you could
live with it if you could live through it. But for days he had
known where they were heading, and why. Nothing quick about it.
Days to think.</p>

<p><em>I am no bloody hero</em>, he thought grimly, <em>
and I&rsquo;m no bloody soldier</em>. Fiercely he pushed down a memory of
walking fortress walls, ordering his last reserves to where another
crop of Trolloc scaling ladders had sprung up. <em>That was</em>
not <em>me the Light burn whoever it was! I&rsquo;m</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He did not
know what he was&mdash;a sour thought&mdash;but whatever he was,
it involved gambling and taverns, women and dancing. That he was
sure of. It involved a good horse and every road in the world to
choose from, not sitting and waiting for somebody to shoot arrows
at him or try to stick a sword or a spear through his ribs. Any
different would make him a fool, and he would not be that, not for
Rand or Moiraine or anybody else.</p>

<p>As he sat up, the silver foxhead medallion, hanging
on its leather thong, slipped from the unlaced neck of his shirt.
He tucked it back before taking a long swallow of wine. The
medallion made him safe from Moiraine, or any other Aes Sedai, as
long as they did not get it away from him&mdash;surely one or
another would try sooner or later&mdash;but nothing except his own
wits kept him safe from some fool killing him along with a few
thousand other fools. Or from Rand, or from being <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em>.</p>

<p>A man ought to be able to find a profit in something
like that, having events twist themselves around him. Rand
certainly had, in a way. He himself had never noticed anything
twisting around him except the fall of dice. He would not turn away
from some of the things that happened to <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> in
stories. Wealth and fame dropped into their pockets as if from the
sky; men who wanted to kill them decided to follow instead, and
women with ice in their eyes decided to melt.</p>

<p>Not that he was complaining at what he had, really.
And certainly not that he wanted anything like Rand&rsquo;s bargain; the
price to get into the game was too high. It was just that he seemed
to be stuck with all the burdens of being <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> and
none of the pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time to go,&rdquo; he told the empty tent, then
paused thoughtfully and sipped at the goblet. &ldquo;It is time to get on
Pips and ride. Ride to Caemlyn, maybe.&rdquo; Not a bad city, so long as
he avoided the Royal Palace. &ldquo;Or Lugard.&rdquo; He had heard rumors about
Lugard. A fine place, that, for the likes of him. &ldquo;Time to leave
Rand in my dust. He&rsquo;s got a bloody Aiel army and more Maidens than
he can count taking care of him. He doesn&rsquo;t need me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That last was not strictly true. In some strange way
he was tied to Rand&rsquo;s success or failure in Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don, him and
Perrin both, three <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> all tangled together. The
histories would probably only mention Rand. Small chance he or
Perrin would find any place in the stories. And then there was the
Horn of Valere. Which he did not want to think about, and would
not. Not until he had to. There might be some way out of that
particular mess yet. Any way he looked at it, the Horn was a
problem for another day. A distant day. With luck, all those bills
would come due on a very distant day. Only, that might take more
luck than he had.</p>

<p>The point now was that he had said all of that about
going and felt scarcely a twinge. Not long ago, he had been unable
even to speak of leaving; when he got too far from Rand, he had
been drawn back like a hooked fish on some invisible line. Then he
had become able to say it, even to lay plans, but the slightest
thing would distract him, make him put off his schemes for stealing
away. Even in Rhuidean, when he had told Rand he was going, he had
been sure something would get in the way. It had, in a manner of
speaking; Mat had made it out of the Waste, but he was no further
from Rand than before. This time, he did not think he would be
diverted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not like I was abandoning him,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;If he
can&rsquo;t bloody take care of himself by now, he&rsquo;ll never be able to.
I&rsquo;m not his bloody nursemaid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Draining the goblet, he scrambled into his green
coat, settled his knives in their hiding places, arranged a dark
yellow silk scarf to hide the hanging scar on his throat, then
snatched up his hat and ducked out.</p>

<p>Heat hit him in the face after the relatively cool
shade inside. He was not sure how the seasons changed here, but
summer was hanging on too long to suit him. One thing he had looked
forward to on leaving the Waste was the arrival of autumn. A little
coolness. No luck here. At least the hat&rsquo;s wide brim kept the sun
off.</p>

<p>This hilly Cairhienin forest was a pitiful thing,
more clearings than trees and half of them going brown in the
drought. Not a patch on the Westwood, back home. Low Aiel tents
were everywhere, though at any distance they took on the look of a
pile of dead leaves or a bare hummock of ground unless the side
flaps were up, and even then they were not easy to see. The Aiel
going about their business did not look at him twice.</p>

<p>From one crest as he crossed the encampment, he
caught sight of Kadere&rsquo;s wagons, all in a circle, the drivers lying
in the shade underneath and the peddler nowhere in view. Kadere
kept to his wagon more and more, seldom poking his nose out except
when Moiraine came to inspect the ladings. The Aiel ringing the
wagons, small knots with spears and bucklers, bows and quivers,
made little pretense of being anything but guards. Moiraine must
think Kadere or some of his men would try to make off with what she
had brought out of Rhuidean. Mat wondered whether Rand realized
that he was giving her anything and everything she asked. For a
while Mat had thought Rand had gotten the upper hand there, but he
was not so sure any longer, even if Moiraine did do everything but
curtsy and fetch Rand&rsquo;s pipe.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s tent was on a hilltop by itself, naturally,
that red banner on a staff at its front. It rippled in a light
breeze, sometimes standing out enough to show the black-and-white
disc. The thing made Mat&rsquo;s skin crawl as much as the Dragon banner
had. If a man wanted to avoid Aes Sedai entanglements, as any but
an idiot would, the last thing to do was wave that symbol
about.</p>

<p>The slopes of the hill were bare, but Maidens&rsquo; tents
encircled the foot of the hill and spread through the trees up
surrounding slopes and down the other side. That was as usual, too,
and so was the Wise Ones&rsquo; camp within the <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>,
dozens of low tents in shouting distance of Rand&rsquo;s hill, with
white-robed <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> bustling about.</p>

<p>There were only a few of the Wise Ones to be seen,
yet they made up for lack of numbers with the stares that followed
him. He had no idea how many could channel in that bunch, but they
were a fair equal of Aes Sedai weighing and measuring when it came
to stares. He picked up his pace, making an effort not to shrug
uncomfortably; he could feel those eyes on his back as surely as he
could have a poke from a stick. And he would have to run the same
gauntlet coming out. Well, a few words with Rand, and it would be
the last time he had to run it.</p>

<p>Only, when he pulled off his hat and ducked into
Rand&rsquo;s tent, no one was there except Natael, lounging on the
cushions with his gilded, dragon-carved harp propped against his
knee and a gold goblet in his hand.</p>

<p>Mat grimaced, and swore under his breath. He should
have known as much. If Rand had been here, he would have had to
pass through a circle of Maidens right around the tent. Most likely
he was up at that new-built tower. A good idea, that. Know the
terrain. That was the second rule, close behind &ldquo;Know your enemy,&rdquo;
and not much to choose between them.</p>

<p>The thought put a sour twist to his mouth. Those
rules came from other men&rsquo;s memories; the only rules he wanted to
remember were &ldquo;Never kiss a girl whose brothers have knife scars&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Never gamble without knowing a back way out.&rdquo; He almost wished
those memories of other men were still separate lumps in his brain
instead of oozing into his thoughts when he least expected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trouble with a bilious stomach?&rdquo; Natael asked
lazily. &ldquo;One of the Wise Ones might have a root to cure it. Or you
could try Moiraine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat could not like the man; he always seemed to be
thinking of a joke he did not mean to share. And he always looked
as if he had three servants taking care of his clothes. All that
snowy lace at collar and cuffs, always seeming freshly laundered.
The fellow never appeared to sweat, either. Why Rand wanted him
around was a mystery. He almost never played anything merry on that
harp. &ldquo;Will he be back soon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Natael shrugged. &ldquo;When he decides to. Perhaps soon,
perhaps late. No man clocks the Lord Dragon. And few women.&rdquo; There
it was again, that secretive smile. A touch bleak, this time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait.&rdquo; He meant to go through with this. Too
many times he had found himself putting off going.</p>

<p>Natael sipped at his wine, studying him across the
goblet&rsquo;s rim.</p>

<p>It was bad enough that Moiraine and the Wise Ones
watched him in that silent, searching way&mdash;sometimes Egwene
did too; she had certainly changed, half Wise One and half Aes
Sedai&mdash;but from Rand&rsquo;s gleeman, it was enough to set his
teeth on edge. The best thing about leaving would be not having
anyone look at him as if they would know in a minute what he was
thinking, and already knew whether his smallclothes were clean.</p>

<p>Two maps lay spread out near the firepit. One, copied
in detail from a tattered map found in a half-burned town, covered
northern Cairhien from west of the Alguenya halfway to the Spine of
the World, while the other, newly drawn and sketchy, showed the
land around the city. Slips of parchment held down with pebbles
dotted both. If he was going to stay, and ignore Natael&rsquo;s searching
look at the same time, there was nothing for it but to study the
maps.</p>

<p>With the toe of his boot he shifted a few pebbles on
the map of the city so he could read what was written on the
parchments. In spite of himself, he winced. If the Aiel scouts
could count, Couladin had nearly one hundred and sixty thousand
spears&mdash;Shaido and those who had supposedly gone to join
their societies among the Shaido. A hard nut to crack, and prickly.
This side of the Spine of the World had not seen an army like that
since Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s time.</p>

<p>The second map showed the other clans that had
crossed the Dragonwall. All had now, in one force or another,
strung out according to when they had left the Jangai and spread
apart, but too close to here for comfort. The Shiande, the Codarra,
the Daryne, and the Miagoma. Between them, they apparently had at
least as many spears as Couladin; they had not left many behind, if
that was true. The seven clans with Rand almost doubled that,
easily enough to face Couladin or the four clans. Either or. Not
both, not at once. But both at once might be what Rand had to
fight.</p>

<p>What the Aiel called the bleakness had to be
affecting those clans too&mdash;every day still men tossed down
their weapons and vanished&mdash;but only a fool would think it
lessened their numbers any more than it did Rand&rsquo;s. And there was
always the possibility that some of those were going to Couladin.
The Aiel did not speak of it very much or very freely, and masked
the idea behind talk of joining societies, but even now, men and
Maidens decided they could not accept Rand or what he had told them
of themselves. Every morning some were missing, and not all left
their spears behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pretty situation, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat&rsquo;s head jerked up at Lan&rsquo;s voice, but the Warder
had entered the tent alone. &ldquo;Just something to look at while I
waited. Is Rand coming back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will be with us soon.&rdquo; Thumbs tucked behind his
sword belt, Lan stood beside Mat, looking down at the map. His
face gave away as much as a statue&rsquo;s would. &ldquo;Tomorrow should bring
the largest battle since Artur Hawkwing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say?&rdquo; Where was Rand? Still up on that
tower, probably. Maybe he should go there. No, he could end up
haring all over the camp, always one step behind. Rand would come
here eventually. He wanted to talk about something besides
Couladin. <em>This fight is none of mine. I&rsquo;m not running away from
anything that concerns me in the least</em>. &ldquo;What about them?&rdquo; He
gestured to the slips representing the Miagoma and the others. &ldquo;Any
word on whether they mean to join Rand, or do they just intend to
sit there watching?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who can say? Rhuarc doesn&rsquo;t seem to know any more
than I do, and if the Wise Ones do, they are not telling. The only
thing certain is that Couladin is not going anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Couladin again. Mat shifted uncomfortably and took a
half-step toward the entrance. No, he <em>would</em> wait.
Fastening his gaze on the maps, he pretended to study them further.
Perhaps Lan would leave him in silence. He just wanted to say his
piece to Rand and go.</p>

<p>The Warder appeared to want to talk, though. &ldquo;What do
you think, Master Gleeman? Should we rush down on Couladin with
everything and crush him tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds as good to me as any other plan,&rdquo; Natael
replied dourly. Emptying the goblet down his throat, he dropped it
on the carpets and picked up the harp to begin softly strumming
something dark and funereal. &ldquo;I lead no armies, Warder. I command
nothing save myself, and not always that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat grunted, and Lan glanced at him before returning
to his study of the maps. &ldquo;You do not think it a good plan? Why
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said it so casually that Mat answered without
thinking. &ldquo;Plenty of reasons. If you surround Couladin, trap him
between you and the city, you might crush him against it.&rdquo; How long
was Rand going to be? &ldquo;But you might push him right over the walls,
too. From what I hear, he&rsquo;s nearly gotten over twice already, even
without miners or siege engines, and the city is hanging on by its
teeth.&rdquo; Say his piece and go, that was it. &ldquo;Press him enough, and
you&rsquo;ll find yourself fighting inside Cairhien. Nasty thing,
fighting in a city. And the idea is to save the place, not finish
ruining it.&rdquo; Those slips laid out on the maps, the maps themselves,
made it all so clear.</p>

<p>Frowning, he squatted with his elbows on his knees.
Lan got down with him, but he hardly noticed. A dicey problem. And
fascinating. &ldquo;Best if you try to shove him away. Hit him from the
south, mainly.&rdquo; He pointed to the River Gaelin; it joined the
Alguenya some miles north of the city. &ldquo;There are bridges up here.
Leave the Shaido a clear path to them. Always leave a way out,
unless you really want to find out how hard a man can fight when
he&rsquo;s nothing to lose.&rdquo; His finger slid east. Wooded hills for the
most part, it seemed. Probably not much different from right around
here. &ldquo;A blocking force here on this side of the river will make
sure they go for the bridges, if it&rsquo;s big enough and positioned
right. Once they are moving, Couladin won&rsquo;t want to try fighting
someone ahead of him while you&rsquo;re coming behind.&rdquo; Yes. Almost
exactly the same as at Jenje. &ldquo;Not unless he&rsquo;s a complete fool,
anyway. They might make it to the river in good order, but those
bridges will choke them. I don&rsquo;t see Aiel swimming, or hunting out
fords for that matter. Keep the pressure on, shove them across.
With luck you&rsquo;ll be able to harry them all the way to the
mountains.&rdquo; It was like Cuaindaigh Fords, too, late in the Trolloc
Wars, and on much the same scale. Not much different from the Tora
Shan, either. Or Sulmein Gap, before Hawkwing found his stride. The
names flickered through his head, the images of bloody fields
forgotten even by historians. Absorbed in the map as he was, they
did not register as anything but his own remembrances. &ldquo;Too bad you
don&rsquo;t have more cavalry. Light cavalry is best for the harrying.
Bite at the flanks, keep them running, and never let them settle to
fight. But Aiel should do almost as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the other reason?&rdquo; Lan asked quietly.</p>

<p>Mat was caught up in it, now. He more than merely
liked gambling, and battle was a gamble to make dicing in taverns a
thing for children and toothless invalids. Lives were the stake
here, your own and other men&rsquo;s, men who were not even there. Make
the wrong wager, a foolish bet, and cities died, or whole nations.
Natael&rsquo;s somber music was fit accompaniment. At the same time, this
was a game that set the blood racing.</p>

<p>Without lifting his eyes from the map, he snorted.
&ldquo;You know as well as I. If even one of those four clans decides to
side with Couladin, they&rsquo;ll take you from behind while your hands
are still full of Shaido. Couladin will be the anvil and they the
hammer, with you the nut between. Only take half of what you have
against Couladin. That makes it an even fight, but you have to
settle for it.&rdquo; There was no such thing as fairness in war. You
took your enemy from behind, when he least expected it, when and
where he was weakest. &ldquo;You still have an edge. He has to worry
about a sortie from the city. The other half, you split in three
parts. One to funnel Couladin to the river, the other two a few
miles apart, between the city and the four clans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very neat,&rdquo; Lan said, nodding. That slab-carved face
never changed, but approval touched his voice, if lightly. &ldquo;It
would gain a clan nothing to attack either force, especially not
when the other could take it in the rear. And none will try to
interfere in what happens around the city for the same reason. Of
course, all four could join. Not likely, if they haven&rsquo;t already,
but if they do, everything changes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat laughed aloud. &ldquo;Everything always changes. The
best plan lasts until the first arrow leaves the bow. This would be
easy enough for a child to handle, except for Indirian and the rest
not knowing their own minds. If they all decide to go over to
Couladin, you toss the dice and hope, because the Dark One&rsquo;s in the
game for sure. At least you&rsquo;ll have enough strength clear of the
city nearly to match them. Enough to hold them for the time you
need. Abandon the idea of pursuing Couladin and turn everything on
them as soon as he&rsquo;s well and truly begun crossing the Gaelin. But
it&rsquo;s my bet they&rsquo;ll wait and watch, and come to you once Couladin
is done for. Victory settles a lot of arguments in most men&rsquo;s
heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The music had stopped. Mat glanced at Natael, and
found the man holding his harp rigidly, staring at him over it
harder than ever. Staring as if he had never seen him before, did
not know what he was. The gleeman&rsquo;s eyes were dark polished glass,
his knuckles white on the harp&rsquo;s gilding.</p>

<p>With that it all crashed home, what he had been
saying, the memories he had been embracing. <em>Burn you for a
fool, for not guarding your tongue!</em> Why had Lan had to take
the conversation that way? Why could he not have talked about
horses, or the weather, or just kept his mouth shut? The Warder had
never seemed all that eager to talk before. Usually the man made a
tree seem talkative. Of course, he could have kept his own mind
focused and his own mouth shut, too. At least he had not been
babbling in the Old Tongue. <em>Blood and ashes, but I</em> hope
<em>I wasn&rsquo;t!</em></p>

<p>Springing to his feet, Mat turned to go, and found
Rand standing just inside the tent, absently twisting that odd bit
of tasseled spear as if he did not realize he was holding it. How
long had he been there? It did not matter. Mat spilled it all out
in a rush. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving, Rand. Come first light in the morning, I
am in the saddle and gone. I&rsquo;d go this minute if I could get far
enough in half a day to suit me for stopping. I mean to put as many
miles between me and the Aiel&mdash;<em>any</em> Aiel&mdash;as
Pips can cover before I make camp.&rdquo; No point in bedding down close
enough to be snapped up and hung out to dry by somebody&rsquo;s scouts;
Couladin must have them out too, and even the others might not
recognize him before he had a spear in his liver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be sorry to see you go,&rdquo; Rand said
quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to talk me out of&mdash;&rdquo; Mat blinked.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it? You&rsquo;ll be sorry to see me go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never tried to make you stay, Mat. Perrin went
when he had to, and so can you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat opened his mouth, then closed it again. Rand had
never tried to make him stay, true. He had just done it without
trying. But there was not the slightest bit of <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>
tugging, now, no vague feelings that he was doing the wrong thing.
He was firm and clear in his purpose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where will you go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;South.&rdquo; Not that there was much choice of direction.
The others led to the Gaelin, with nothing north of the river that
he was interested in, or else to Aiel, one lot that would certainly
kill him and one that might or might not, depending on how close by
Rand was and what they had had for supper the night before. Not
good odds, by his reckoning. &ldquo;To begin, anyway. Then somewhere
there&rsquo;s a tavern, and some women who don&rsquo;t carry spears.&rdquo;
Melindhra. She might present a problem. He had the feeling she
might be the sort of woman who did not let go until she wanted.
Well, one way or another, he would deal with her. Maybe he could
just ride out before she knew it. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t for me, Rand. I don&rsquo;t
know anything about battles, and I don&rsquo;t want to know.&rdquo; He avoided
looking at Lan and Natael. If either man cracked his teeth, he
would punch him right in the mouth. Even the Warder. &ldquo;You
understand, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s nod could have been understanding. Maybe it
was. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d forget saying goodbye to Egwene, were I you. I am no
longer certain how much of what I tell her I might as well be
telling Moiraine, or the Wise Ones, or both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reached that conclusion a long time ago. She&rsquo;s
left Emond&rsquo;s Field further behind than either of us. And regrets it
less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Rand said sadly. &ldquo;The Light shine on you,
Mat,&rdquo; he added, sticking out his hand, &ldquo;and send you smooth roads,
fair weather and pleasant company until we meet again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That would not be soon, if Mat had his way. He felt a
little sad about that, and a little foolish for feeling sad, yet a
man had to look after himself. When all was said and done, that was
the long and short of it.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s grip was as hard as it had ever been&mdash;all that swordwork had only added new calluses atop older bowman&rsquo;s&mdash;but the ridged heron brand in his palm was distinct against
Mat&rsquo;s hand. Just a little reminder, in case he should forget the
markings under his friend&rsquo;s coatsleeves, or those even stranger
things inside his head that let him channel. If he could forget
that Rand could channel&mdash;and he had not thought of it once in
days; days!&mdash;then it was <em>far</em> past time to be
gone.</p>

<p>A few more awkward words standing there&mdash;Lan
seemed to ignore them, arms folded, silently studying the maps,
while Natael had begun idly plucking his harp; Mat had an ear for
music, and to him the unfamiliar tune had an ironic sound; he
wondered why the fellow had chosen it&mdash;a few more moments and
Rand half-stepping around actually putting an end to it, and then
Mat was outside. There was a crowd out there, a good hundred
Maidens spread about the hilltop and walking on tiptoe they were so
ready to spear somebody, all seven clan chiefs waiting patient and
still as stone, three Tairen lords trying to pretend that they were
not sweating and the Aiel did not exist.</p>

<p>He had heard about the lords&rsquo; arrival, and had even
gone to take a look at their camp&mdash;or camps&mdash;but there
had been no one there he knew, and no one wanting to take a turn at
dice or cards. These three eyed him up and down, frowning
disdainfully, and apparently decided he was no better than the
Aiel, which was to say not worth seeing.</p>

<p>Clapping his hat on his head and pulling the brim low
over his eyes, Mat studied the Tairens coldly in return for a
moment. He had the pleasure of seeing the younger pair, at least,
become uncomfortably aware of him again before he started down the
hill. The gray-beard still looked all barely concealed impatience
to enter Rand&rsquo;s tent, but it did not matter anyway. He would never
see any of them again.</p>

<p>He had no idea why he had not simply ignored them.
Except that his step was lighter and he felt full of vinegar. No
wonder, really, leaving tomorrow at last. The dice seemed to be
spinning in his head, and there was no knowing what pips would show
when they landed. Odd, that. It must be Melindhra worrying him.
Yes. He would definitely leave early, and as quietly as a mouse
tiptoeing on feathers.</p>

<p>Whistling, he set off for his tent. What was the
tune? Oh, yes. &ldquo;Dance with Jak o&rsquo; the Shadows.&rdquo; He had no intention
of dancing with death, but it had a merry sound, so he whistled it
anyway as he tried to plan the best route away from Cairhien.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Rand stood staring after Mat long after the tent
flaps had fallen to hide him. &ldquo;I only heard the last bit,&rdquo; he said
finally. &ldquo;Was it all like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very nearly,&rdquo; Lan replied. &ldquo;With only a few minutes
to study the maps, he laid out close to the battle plan that Rhuarc
and the others made. He saw the difficulties and the dangers, and
how to meet them. He knows about miners and siege engines, and
using light cavalry to harry a defeated foe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand looked at him. The Warder showed no surprise,
not the twitch of an eyelash. Of course, he was the one who had
said Mat seemed surprisingly knowledgeable about military matters.
And Lan was not going to ask the obvious question, either, which
was good. Rand had no right to give the little answer he had.</p>

<p>He could have asked a few questions himself. Such as,
What did miners have to do with battles? Or maybe it was only
sieges. Whatever the answer, there was not a mine closer than the
Dragon&rsquo;s Dagger, and no certainty anyone was still digging ore.
Well, this battle would be fought without. The important thing was
that he knew Mat had gained more on the other side of that doorway
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> than a tendency to spout the Old Tongue when
not thinking. And knowing that, Rand would surely make use of
it.</p>

<p><em>You don&rsquo;t have to get any harder</em>, he thought
bitterly. He had seen Mat climbing toward this tent, and never
hesitated in sending Lan in to discover what might come to the
surface in idle conversation, alone. That had been deliberate. The
rest might or might not be, but it would happen. He hoped Mat had a
fine time while he was free. He hoped that Perrin was enjoying
himself in the Two Rivers, showing off Faile to his mother and
sisters, maybe marrying her. He hoped it because he knew he would
draw them back, <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> pulling at <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, and
he the strongest. Moiraine had named it no coincidence, three such
growing up in the same village, all nearly the same age; the Wheel
wove happenstance and coincidence into the Pattern, but it did not
lay down the likes of the three of them for no reason. Eventually
he would pull his friends back to him, however far they went, and
when they came, he would use them, however he could. However he had
to. Because he did have to. Because whatever the Prophecy of the
Dragon said, he was sure the only chance he had of winning Tarmon
Gai&rsquo;don lay in having all three of them, three <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>
who had been tied together since infancy, tied together once more.
No, he did not need to become hard. <em>You&rsquo;re rank enough already
to make a Seanchan spew his supper!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Play &lsquo;March of Death,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; he commanded in a harsher
voice than he wanted, and Natael looked at him blankly for a
moment. The man had been listening to everything. He would have
questions, but he would find no answers. If Rand could not tell Lan
Mat&rsquo;s secrets, he would not spread them before one of the Forsaken,
however tame he appeared. This time he deliberately made his tone
rough, and pointed the length of spear at the man. &ldquo;Play it, unless
you know a sadder. Play something to make your soul weep. If you
have one still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Natael gave him an ingratiating smile and a seated
bow, but he went white around the eyes. It was indeed &ldquo;The March of
Death&rdquo; that he began, yet it had a sharper edge on his harp than
ever before, a dirge-like keen that surely would make any soul
weep. He stared fixedly at Rand as if hoping to see some
effect.</p>

<p>Turning away, Rand stretched out on the carpets with
his head to the maps and a red-and-gold cushion under his elbow.
&ldquo;Lan, would you ask the others to come in now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Warder made a formal bow before stepping outside.
It was the first time that he had ever done that, but Rand noticed
only absently.</p>

<p>The battle would begin tomorrow. It was a polite
fiction that he helped Rhuarc and the others plan. He was smart
enough to know what he did not know, and despite all of his talks
with Lan and Rhuarc, he knew he was not ready. <em>I&rsquo;ve planned a
hundred battles this size or more and given orders that led to ten
times as many</em>. Not his thought. Lews Therin knew war&mdash;had known war&mdash;but not Rand al&rsquo;Thor, and that was him. He
listened, asked questions&mdash;and nodded as if he understood
when the chiefs said a thing should be done a certain way.
Sometimes he did understand and wished he did not, because he knew
where that understanding came from. His only real contribution had
been to say that Couladin had to be defeated without destroying the
city. In any case, this meeting would only add a few touches at
most to what had already been decided. Mat would have been useful,
with his new-found knowledge.</p>

<p>No. He would not think of his friends, of what he
would do to them before it was all done. Even leaving the battle
aside, there was plenty to occupy him, things he could do something
about. The absence of Cairhienin flags above Cairhien marked a
major problem, and the continued skirmishes with Andorans another.
What Sammael was up to warranted thought, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The chiefs filed in in no particular order. This time
Dhearic came first, Rhuarc and Erim together at the rear with Lan.
Bruan and Jheran took the places next to Rand. They did not concern
themselves with precedence among themselves, and <em>
Aan&rsquo;allein</em> they seemed to take as all but one of them.</p>

<p>Weiramon entered last, his lordlings at his heels and
a tight-mouthed scowl on his face. Precedence certainly mattered to
him. Muttering into his oiled beard, he stalked his way around the
firepit, taking up a place behind Rand. Until the chiefs&rsquo; flat
stares finally broke through his shell, at least. Among Aiel, a
close kinsman or society brother might position himself so, if
there was the possibility of a knife in the back. He still frowned
at Jheran and Dhearic as though expecting one of them to make
room.</p>

<p>Finally Bael gestured to the place beside him, across
the maps from Rand, and after a pause, Weiramon strode back to sit
cross-legged and rigid, staring straight ahead and looking like a
man who had swallowed an unripe plum whole. The younger Tairens
stood almost as stiffly at his back, one with the grace to look
embarrassed.</p>

<p>Rand took note of him but said not a word, only
thumbed his pipe full of tabac and seized <em>saidin</em> long
enough to light it. He had to do something about Weiramon; the man
exacerbated old problems and made new ones. Not a flicker crossed
Rhuarc&rsquo;s features, but the other chiefs&rsquo; expressions ranged from
Lan&rsquo;s sour disgust to Erim&rsquo;s clear, cold-eyed readiness to dance
spears there and then. Perhaps there was a way for Rand to rid
himself of Weiramon and make a beginning on another of his worries
at the same time.</p>

<p>With Rand&rsquo;s example, Lan and the chiefs began filling
pipes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see only small changes necessary,&rdquo; Bael said,
puffing his pipe alight, and sparking a glower from Han, as
usual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do these small changes concern the Goshien, or
perhaps some other clan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Putting Weiramon from his mind, Rand bent himself to
listening as they worked out what had to be altered from their new
view of the terrain. Now and again one of the Aiel would glance at
Natael, a brief tightness to eyes or mouth suggesting that the
mournful music plucked at something in him. Even the Tairens
grimaced sadly. The sounds washed over Rand, though, touching
nothing. Tears were a luxury he could no longer afford, not even
inside.</p>
