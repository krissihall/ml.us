<h4><em>The Threads Burn</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">R</span>and
stopped. A long scorch along the corridor wall
marked where half a dozen costly tapestries had gone to ash. Flames
licked upward on another; a number of inlaid chests and tables were
only charred ruins. Not his work. Thirty paces further on,
red-coated men in breastplates and helmets with barred face-guards
lay contorted in death on the white floor-tiles, useless swords in
hand. Not his work either. Rahvin had been wasteful of his own in
attempting to reach Rand. He had been clever in his attacks, clever
in his escapes, but from the moment he fled the throne-room he had
not faced Rand for more than the instant it took to strike and
flee. Rahvin was strong, perhaps as strong as Rand, and more
knowledgeable, but Rand had the fat-little-man <em>angreal</em> in
his pocket, and Rahvin had none.</p>

<p>The corridor was doubly familiar, once for having
seen it before, once for having seen something similar.</p>

<p><em>I walked this way with Elayne and Gawyn the day I
met Morgase</em>. The thought slithered painfully along the
boundaries of the Void. He was cold in there, without emotion.
<em>Saidin</em> raged and burned, but he was icy calm.</p>

<p>And another thought, like a stab. <em>She lay on a
floor like this, her golden hair spread as though sleeping. Ilyena
Sunhair. My Ilyena</em>.</p>

<p>Elaida had been there that day, too. <em>She Foretold
the pain I&rsquo;d bring. She knew the darkness in me. Some of it.
Enough</em>.</p>

<p><em>Ilyena, I did not know what I was doing. I was
mad! I am mad. Oh, Ilyena!</em></p>

<p><em>Elaida knew&mdash;some&mdash;but she did not
tell even all of that. Better if she had told</em>.</p>

<p><em>Oh, Light, is there no forgiveness? I did what I
did in madness. Is there no mercy?</em></p>

<p><em>Gareth Bryne would have killed me, had he known.
Morgase would have ordered my death. Morgase would be alive,
perhaps. Elayne&rsquo;s mother alive. Aviendha alive. Mat. Moiraine. How
many alive, if I had died?</em></p>

<p><em>I have earned my torment. I deserve the final
death. Oh, Ilyena, I deserve death</em>.</p>

<p><em>I deserve death</em>.</p>

<p>Bootsteps behind him. He turned.</p>

<p>They came out of a broad crossing corridor not twenty
paces from him, two dozen men in breastplates and helmets and the
white-collared red coats of the Queen&rsquo;s Guards. Except that Andor
had no queen now, and these men had not served her while she lived.
A Myrddraal led them, pale eyeless face like something found under
a rock, overlapping plates of black armor heightening the illusion
of a serpent as it moved, black cloak hanging motionless however it
moved. The look of the Eyeless was fear, but fear was a distant
thing in the Void. They hesitated when they saw him; then the
Halfman raised its black-bladed sword. Men who had not already
drawn put hands to hilts.</p>

<p>Rand&mdash;he thought that was his name&mdash;channeled in a way he could not remember doing before.</p>

<p>Men and Myrddraal stiffened where they stood. White
frost grew thick on them, frost that smoked as Mat&rsquo;s boots had
smoked. The Myrddraal&rsquo;s upraised arm broke off with a loud crack.
When it hit the floortiles, arm and sword shattered.</p>

<p>Rand could feel the cold&mdash;yes, that was his
name; Rand&mdash;cold like a knife as he walked past and turned
the way they had come. Cold, yet warmer than <em>saidin</em>.</p>

<p>A man and a woman crouched against the wall, servants
liveried in red and white, short of their middle years and holding
each other as though for protection. Seeing Rand&mdash;there was
more to the name; not just Rand&mdash;the man started to rise from
where he had huddled away from the Myrddraal-led band, but the
woman hauled him back by his sleeve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go in peace,&rdquo; Rand said, putting out a hand.
Al&rsquo;Thor. Yes, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not hurt you, but you could be
hurt if you stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman&rsquo;s brown eyes rolled up in her head. She
would have collapsed in a heap if the man had not caught her, and
his narrow mouth was working rapidly, as if he was praying but
could not get the words out.</p>

<p>Rand looked where the man was looking. His hand had
stretched out of his coatsleeve far enough to bare the Dragon&rsquo;s
golden maned head that was part of his skin. &ldquo;I will not hurt you,&rdquo;
he said, and walked on, leaving them there. He had Rahvin to corner
yet. Rahvin to kill. And then?</p>

<p>No sound but the click of his boots on the tiles. And
deep in his head, a faint voice murmuring mournfully of Ilyena and
forgiveness. He strained to feel Rahvin channeling, to feel the man
filled with the True Source. Nothing. <em>Saidin</em> seared his
bones, froze his flesh, scoured his soul, but from without it was
not easy to see until you were close. A lion in high grass,
Asmodean had said once. A rabid lion. Should Asmodean count among
those who should not have died? Or Lanfear? No. Not&mdash;</p>

<p>He had only a moment&rsquo;s warning to throw himself flat,
a hair-thin slice of time between feeling flows suddenly woven and
an arm-thick bar of white light, liquid fire, slicing through the
wall, ripping across like a sword through where his chest had been.
Where that bar slashed, on both sides of the hallways, wall and
friezes, doors and tapestries ceased to exist. Severed
wall-hangings and chunks of stone and plaster broken free rained to
the floor.</p>

<p>So much for the Forsaken fearing to use balefire. Who
had told him that? Moiraine. She surely had deserved to live.</p>

<p>Balefire leaped from his hands, a brilliant white
shaft streaking toward where that other bar had originated. The
other failed even as his punched through the wall, leaving a purple
afterimage fanning across his vision. He released his own flow. Had
he done it finally?</p>

<p>Scrambling to his feet, he channeled Air, slamming
ruined doors open so hard that the remnants ripped from the hinges.
Inside, the room was empty. A sitting room, with chairs arrayed
before a great marble fireplace. His balefire had taken a bite out
of one of the arches leading to a small courtyard with a fountain,
and another from one of the fluted columns along the walk
beyond.</p>

<p>Rahvin had not gone that way, though, and he had not
died in that blast of balefire. A residue hung in the air, a fading
remnant of woven <em>saidin</em>. Rand recognized it. Different
from the gateway he had made to Skim to Caemlyn, or the one to
Travel&mdash;he knew now that was what he had done&mdash;into the
throne room. But he had seen one like this in Tear, had made one
himself.</p>

<p>He wove another now. A gateway, an opening at least,
a hole in reality. It was not blackness on the other side. In fact,
if he had not known the way was there, if he could not have seen
the weave of it, he might not have known. There before him were the
same arches opening onto the same courtyard and fountain, the same
columned walk. For an instant the neatly rounded holes his balefire
had made in arch and column wavered, filled, then were holes again.
Wherever that gateway led, it was to somewhere else, a reflection
of the Royal palace as once it had been a reflection of the Stone
of Tear. Vaguely he regretted not talking to Asmodean about it
while he had the chance, but he had never been able to speak of
that day to anyone. It did not matter. On that day he had carried
<em>Callandor</em>, but the <em>angreal</em> in his pocket had
already proved enough to harry Rahvin.</p>

<p>Stepping through quickly, he loosed the weave and
hurried away across the courtyard as the gateway vanished. Rahvin
would have felt that gate if he was close enough and trying. The
fat little stone man did not mean he could stand and wait to be
attacked.</p>

<p>No sign of life, except for himself and one fly. That
was the way it had been in Tear, too. Stand-lamps in the hallways
stood unlit, with pale wicks that had never seen a flame, yet even
in what should have been the dimmest hall there was light,
seemingly coming from everywhere and nowhere. Sometimes those lamps
moved, too, and other things as well. Between one glance and the
next a tall lamp might have moved a foot, a vase in a niche an
inch. Little things, as if someone had shifted them in the time his
eyes were away. Wherever this was, it was a strange place.</p>

<p>It came to him, as he trotted along another
colonnade, sensing for Rahvin, that he had not heard the voice
crying over Ilyena since he channeled balefire. Perhaps he had
somehow chased Lews Therin out of his head.</p>

<p><em>Good</em>. He stopped at the edge of one of the
palace gardens. The roses and whitestar bushes looked as drought
bedraggled as they would have in the real palace. On some of the
white spires rising above the rooftops, the White Lion banner
rippled, but which spire could change in the blink of an eye.
<em>Good, if I don&rsquo;t have to share my head with</em>&mdash;</p>

<p>He felt odd. Insubstantial. He raised his arm, and
stared. He could see the garden through coatsleeve and arm as
through a mist. A mist that was thinning. When he glanced down, he
could see the walk&rsquo;s paving stones through himself.</p>

<p><em>No!</em> It was not his thought. An image began
to coalesce. A tall, dark-eyed man with a worry-creased face and
more white in his hair than brown. <em>I am Lews
Ther</em>&mdash;</p>

<p><em>I am Rand al&rsquo;Thor</em>, Rand broke in. He did not
know what was happening, but the faint Dragon was beginning to fade
from the misty arm held in front of his face. The arm began to look
darker, the fingers on his hand longer. <em>I am me</em>. That
echoed in the Void. <em>I am Rand al&rsquo;Thor</em>.</p>

<p>He fought to picture himself in his own mind,
struggled to make the image of what he saw in the mirror every day
shaving, what he saw in a stand-mirror dressing. It was a frantic
fight. He had never really looked at himself. The two images waxed
and waned, the older dark-eyed man and the younger with blue-gray
eyes. Slowly the younger image firmed, the older faded. Slowly his
arm grew more solid. His arm, with the Dragon twined around it and
the heron branded into his palm. There had been times he hated
those marks, but now, even enclosed within the emotionless Void, he
almost grinned to see them.</p>

<p>Why had Lews Therin tried to take him over? To make
him into Lews Therin. He was sure that was who that dark-eyed man
with the suffering face had been. Why now? Because he could in this
place, whatever it was? Wait. It had been Lews Therin who shouted
that adamant &ldquo;no.&rdquo; Not an attack by Lews Therin. By Rahvin, and not
using the Power. If the man had been able to do this back in
Caemlyn, the real Caemlyn, he would have. It had to be some ability
he had gained here. And if Rahvin had gained it, perhaps he had
too. The image of himself had been what held him, brought him
back.</p>

<p>He focused on the nearest rosebush, a thing a span
high, and imagined it growing thin, foggy. Obediently, it melted
away to nothing, but as soon as the picture in his mind was
nothing, the rosebush was suddenly back, just as it had been.</p>

<p>Rand nodded coldly. It had limits, then. There were
always limits and rules, and he did not know them here. But he knew
the Power, as much as Asmodean had taught him and he had taught
himself, and <em>saidin</em> was still in him, all the sweetness of
life, all the corruption of death. Rahvin had to have seen him to
attack. With the Power you had to see something to affect it, or
know exactly where it was in relation to you down to a hair.
Perhaps it was different here, but he did not think so. He almost
wished Lews Therin had not gone silent again. The man might know
this place and its rules.</p>

<p>Balconies and windows overlooked the garden, in some
places four stories high. Rahvin had tried to unmake him. He drew
on the raging torrent of <em>saidin</em> through the
<em>angreal</em>. Lightnings flashed from the sky, a hundred
forking silver bolts, more, stabbing at every window, every
balcony. Thunder filled the garden, erupting chunks of stone. The
air itself crackled, and the hair on his arms and chest tried to
stand under his shirt. Even the hair on his head began to lift. He
let the lightnings die. Here and there bits of shattered stone
window frame and balcony broke loose, the crash of their fall muted
by the echoes of thunder still ringing in his ears.</p>

<p>Gaping holes peered down now where windows had. They
looked like sockets in some monstrous skull, the ruined balconies
like a dozen splintered mouths. If Rahvin had been at any of them,
he was surely dead. Rand would not believe it until he saw the
corpse. He wanted to see Rahvin dead.</p>

<p>Wearing a snarl he did not know was there, he stalked
back into the palace. He had wanted to see Rahvin die.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Nynaeve hurled herself flat and scrambled along the
hall floor as <em>something</em> slashed through the nearest wall.
Moghedien slithered as fast as she, but if the woman had not, she
would have hauled her by the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>. Had that been Rand, or
Rahvin? She had seen bars of white fire, liquid light, like that in
Tanchico, and she had no wish to be anywhere near one again. She
did not know what it was, and she did not want to know. <em>I want
to Heal, burn both of these fool men, not learn a fancy way to
kill!</em></p>

<p>She levered herself up to a crouch, peered back the
way they had come. Nothing. An empty palace hallway. With a
ten-foot long gash through both walls, as neat as any stoneworker
could have done, and bits of tapestry lying on the floor. No sign
of either man. She had not had a glimpse of either so far. Only
their handiwork. Sometimes that handiwork had almost been her. A
good thing that she could draw on Moghedien&rsquo;s anger, filter it out
of the terror clawing to escape and let it seep into her. Her own
was a pitiful thing that would scarcely have allowed her to sense
the True Source, much less channel the flow of Spirit that kept her
in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.</p>

<p>Moghedien was hunched over on her knees, dry
retching. Nynaeve&rsquo;s mouth tightened. The woman had tried to remove
the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> again. Her cooperation had faded quickly when
they discovered Rand and Rahvin actually here in
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. Well, trying to unfasten that collar when
it was around your neck was its own punishment. At least Moghedien
did not have anything left in her stomach this time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please.&rdquo; Moghedien caught at Nynaeve&rsquo;s skirt. &ldquo;I
tell you, we must get away.&rdquo; Stark panic made her voice painful.
Moghedien&rsquo;s clawing terror mirrored itself on her face. &ldquo;They are
here in the flesh. The flesh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; Nynaeve said absently. &ldquo;Unless you&rsquo;ve
lied to me, that is an advantage. For me.&rdquo; The other woman claimed
that being in the World of Dreams physically limited your control
of the Dream. Or rather, she admitted it, after letting a bit of
the knowledge slip. She had admitted, too, that Rahvin did not know
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> as well as she. Nynaeve hoped that meant he
did not know it as well as <em>she</em> did. That he knew more than
Rand, she did not doubt. That wool-headed man! Whatever his reason
for coming after Rahvin, he should never have let the man lead him
here, where he did not know the rules, where thoughts could
kill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why will you not understand what I tell you? Even if
they had only dreamed themselves here, either would be stronger
than we. Here in the flesh, they could crush us without blinking.
In the flesh they can draw <em>saidin</em> more deeply than we can
draw <em>saidar</em> dreaming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are linked.&rdquo; Still not paying attention, Nynaeve
gave her braid a sharp pull. No way to tell which direction they
had gone. And no warning of anything until she saw them. Somehow it
still seemed unfair that they could channel without her being able
to see or feel the flows. A stand-lamp that had been sliced in two
was suddenly whole again, then not, just as quickly. That white
fire must be incredibly powerful. <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> usually
healed itself rapidly whatever you did to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You brainless fool,&rdquo; Moghedien sobbed, shaking
Nynaeve&rsquo;s skirt with both hands as if wanting to shake Nynaeve. &ldquo;It
does not matter how brave you are. We are linked, but you
contribute nothing the way you are. Not a shred. It is my strength,
and your madness. They are here in the flesh, not dreaming! They
are using things you have never dreamed of! They will destroy us if
we stay!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep your voice down,&rdquo; Nynaeve snapped. &ldquo;Do you want
to bring one of them down on us?&rdquo; She looked both ways hurriedly,
but the hallway was still empty. Had that been footsteps, boots?
Rand or Rahvin? One had to be approached as carefully as the other.
A man in a fight for his life could strike out before he saw they
were friends. Well, that she was, anyway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must go,&rdquo; Moghedien insisted, but she did lower
her voice. She got to her feet, sullen defiance twisting her mouth.
Fear and anger writhed inside her, first one stronger, then the
other. &ldquo;Why should I help you any further? This is madness!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you rather feel the nettles again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moghedien flinched, yet her dark eyes remained
stubborn. &ldquo;You think I will let them kill me rather than be hurt by
you? You <em>are</em> mad. I will not stir from this spot until you
are ready to take us away from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve jerked her braid again. If Moghedien refused
to walk, she would have to drag her. Not a very quick way to
search, with what seemed miles of palace corridors yet to go. She
should have been harsher when the woman first tried balking. In
Nynaeve&rsquo;s place, Moghedien would have killed without hesitation,
or, if she thought the other useful, woven the trick of taking
someone&rsquo;s will, making them worship her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Nynaeve had tasted
that once, in Tanchico, and even had she known how it was done, she
did not think she could do it to somebody else. She despised this
woman, hated her with all her being. But even if she had not needed
her, she could not have killed her just standing there. The trouble
was, she was afraid that Moghedien knew that too, now.</p>

<p>Still, a Wisdom headed the Women&rsquo;s Circle&mdash;even
if the Circle did not always agree&mdash;and the Women&rsquo;s Circle
dealt out punishments to women who broke the law or offended custom
too deeply, and to men, too, for some transgressions. She might not
have Moghedien&rsquo;s stomach for killing, for crushing people&rsquo;s minds,
but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moghedien opened her mouth, and Nynaeve filled it
with a gag of Air. Or rather she made Moghedien do it; with the
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em> linking them, it was like channeling herself, but
Moghedien knew it was her own abilities being used like a tool in
Nynaeve&rsquo;s hand. Dark eyes glittered indignantly as Moghedien&rsquo;s own
flows snared her arms to her sides and pulled her skirts tight
around her ankles. For the rest, Nynaeve used the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>,
just as with the nettles, creating the sensations she wanted the
other woman to feel. Not the reality; the <em>feel</em> of
reality.</p>

<p>Moghedien stiffened in her bonds as a leather strap
seemed to strike her bottom. That was what it would feel like to
her. Outrage and humiliation rolled through the leash. And
contempt. Compared to her elaborate ways of hurting people, this
seemed suitable for a child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you are ready to cooperate again,&rdquo; Nynaeve
said, &ldquo;just nod.&rdquo; This could not take long. She could not just
stand there while Rand and Rahvin tried to kill one another. If the
wrong one died because she avoided danger by letting Moghedien keep
her there&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nynaeve remembered a day when she was sixteen, just
after she had been judged old enough to put her hair in a braid.
She had stolen a plum pudding from Corin Ayellin on a dare from
Nela Thane and walked out the kitchen door right into Mistress
Ayellin. Adding the aftermath, sending it along the leash in a
lump, made Moghedien&rsquo;s eyes pop.</p>

<p>Grimly, Nynaeve did it again. <em>She won&rsquo;t stop me
short!</em> Again. <em>I will help Rand whatever she thinks!</em>
Again. <em>Even if it kills us!</em> Again. <em>Oh, Light, she
could be right; Rand could kill us both before he knows it&rsquo;s
me</em>. Again. <em>Light, I hate being afraid!</em> Again. <em>I
hate her!</em> Again. <em>I hate her!</em> Again.</p>

<p>Abruptly she realized Moghedien was jerking
frantically in her bonds, nodding her head so violently it seemed
about to come off. For a moment, Nynaeve gaped at the other woman&rsquo;s
tear-streaked face, then stopped what she was doing and hurriedly
unraveled the flows of Air. Light, what had she done? She was not
Moghedien. &ldquo;I take it you won&rsquo;t give me any more trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will kill us,&rdquo; the other woman mumbled faintly,
and nearly unintelligibly through her sobs, but at the same time
she nodded a hurried acquiescence.</p>

<p>Deliberately, Nynaeve hardened herself. Moghedien
deserved everything she had gotten and much, much more. In the
Tower, one of the Forsaken would have been stilled and executed as
soon as the trial could be concluded, and little evidence needed
beside who she was. &ldquo;Good. Now we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thunder shook the entire palace, or something very
much like thunder, except that the walls rattled and dust rose off
the floor. Nynaeve half fell into Moghedien, and they danced trying
to keep their feet. Before the upheaval had faded completely, it
was replaced by a roar like some monstrous fire racing up a chimney
the size of a mountain. That lasted only a moment. The silence
after seemed deeper than before. No. There were boots. A man
running. The sound echoed down the hallway. From the north.</p>

<p>Nynaeve pushed the other woman away. &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moghedien whimpered, but did not resist being pulled
down the hall. Her eyes were huge, though, and her breath came too
fast. Nynaeve thought it was a good thing she had Moghedien along,
and not just for access to the One Power. After all her years
hiding in shadows, the Spider was such a coward she almost made
Nynaeve feel brave by comparison. Almost. It was only anger at her
own fear that made her able to hold on to that one flow of Spirit
that kept her in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, now. Moghedien was stark
terror to her bones.</p>

<p>Pulling Moghedien behind her by the gleaming leash,
Nynaeve quickened her step. Chasing the fading sound of those other
steps.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Rand stepped into the round courtyard warily. Half of
the white-paved circle cut into the structure rising three stories
behind him; the other half was bounded by a stone semicircle atop
pale columns five paces high, sticking out into yet another garden,
shaded gravel walks beneath low spreading trees. Marble benches
surrounded a pool with lily-pads. And fish, gold and white and
red.</p>

<p>Suddenly the benches shifted, flowed, changed into
faceless man-shapes, still as white and hard-looking as the stone.
He had already learned the difficulty of changing something that
Rahvin had altered. Lightning danced from his fingertips,
shattering stone men to shards.</p>

<p>The air became water. Choking, Rand struggled to swim
toward the columns; he could see the garden beyond. There must be
some kind of barrier to stop all the water pouring out. Before he
could channel, gold and red and white shapes were darting around
him, larger than the fish in the pool had been. And with teeth.
They ripped at him; blood curled up in red mist. Instinctively he
flailed at the fish with his hands, but the cold part of him, deep
in the Void, channeled. Balefire flared, at the barrier if there
was one, at any place Rahvin might be to see this courtyard. The
water roiled, throwing him around violently, as it rushed in to
fill the empty tunnels carved by balefire. Flickers of gold and
white and red darted at him, adding new threads of crimson to the
water. Tossed about, he could not see to aim his wild bolts; they
flashed in every direction. No breath left. He tried to think of
air, or the water being air.</p>

<p>Suddenly it was. He dropped hard to the paving stones
among small fish flopping about, rolled over and pushed himself up.
It was all air again; even his clothes were dry. The stone ring
flickered between standing untouched and lying in ruins with half
the columns down. Some of the trees lay tangled atop their own
stumps, then stood whole, then were fallen again. The palace behind
him had holes punched in white walls, even one through a high
gilded dome above, and gashes slashed across windows, some with
pierce-work stone screens. The damage all flickered, vanishing and
reappearing. Not the slow, sometime shifts of before, but constant.
Damage, then none, then some, then none, then all again.</p>

<p>Wincing, he pressed his hand to his side, to the old,
half-healed wound. It stung as if his exertions had nearly torn it
open. He stung all over, from a dozen or more bleeding bites. That
had not changed. The bloody rips in his coat and breeches were
still there. Had he managed to change the water back to air? Or had
one of his frenzied bolts of balefire driven Rahvin off, or even
killed him? It did not matter, unless it was the last.</p>

<p>Wiping blood out of his eyes, he studied the windows
and balconies around the garden, the colonnade high on the far
side. Or rather, he started to, but something else caught his eye.
Below the colonnade, he could just make out the fading remnants of
a weave. From there he could tell it was a gateway, but to see what
kind and where it led, he had to be closer. Leaping over a jumble
of worked stone that vanished while he was above it, he darted
across the garden, dodging around trees fallen on the walkway. That
residue was almost gone; he had to get close enough before it
vanished completely.</p>

<p>Abruptly he fell, gravel scraping his palms as he
caught himself. He could not see anything that might have tripped
him. He felt woozy, almost as if he had been hit on the head. He
tried to scramble to his feet, to reach that residue. And realized
his body was writhing. Long hair covered his hands; his fingers
seemed to be shrinking, drawing back into his hands. They were
almost paws. A trap. Rahvin had not fled. The gateway had been a
trap, and he had walked into it.</p>

<p>Desperation clung to the Void as he struggled to
cling to himself. His hands. They were hands. Almost hands. He
forced himself up. His legs seemed to bend wrong. The True Source
receded; the Void shrank. Streaks of panic flared beyond the
emotionless emptiness. Whatever Rahvin was trying to change him to,
it could not channel. <em>Saidin</em> slipping away, thinning, thin
even pulled through the <em>angreal</em>. The surrounding balconies
stared down at him, empty, and the colonnade. Rahvin had to be at
one of those stone-screened windows, but which? He had no strength
for a hundred lightning bolts this time. One burst. He could manage
that. If he did it quickly. Which window? He fought to be himself,
fought to draw <em>saidin</em> into him, welcomed every stain of
the taint as evidence that he still held the Power. Staggering in a
crooked circle, searching vainly, he roared Rahvin&rsquo;s name. It
sounded like a beast&rsquo;s roar.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Pulling Moghedien behind her, Nynaeve rounded the
corner. Ahead of her, a man vanished around the next turning, the
sound of his boots echoing behind. She did not know how long she
had been following those boots. Sometimes they had gone silent, and
she had had to wait for them to start again to gain a direction.
Sometimes when they stopped things happened; she had not seen any
of it, but once the palace had rung like a struck bell, and another
time the hair on her head had tried to stand up as the air seemed
to crackle, and another&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It did not matter. This was the first
time she had caught a glimpse of the man who wore those boots. She
did not think it was Rand in that black coat. The height was right,
but he was too large, too heavy in the chest.</p>

<p>She was running before she knew it. Her stout shoes
had long since become velvet slippers for silence. If she could
hear him, he could hear her. Moghedien&rsquo;s frenzied panting was
louder than their footfalls.</p>

<p>Nynaeve reached the turn and stopped, peeking
cautiously around the corner. She held <em>saidar</em>&mdash;through Moghedien, but it was hers&mdash;ready to channel. There
was no need. The hallway was empty. A door stood far down a wall
with windows filled with arabesque-pierced stone, but she did not
think he could have reached that. Nearer, another corridor ran off
to the right. She hurried to that, looked warily again. Empty. But
a staircase spiraled upward just beyond where the hallways met.</p>

<p>For a moment she hesitated. He had been hurrying
somewhere. This corridor led back the way they had come. Would he
have been running to go back? Up then.</p>

<p>Drawing Moghedien behind her, she climbed the steps
slowly, straining to hear anything except the Forsaken&rsquo;s nearly
hysterical breath and the blood pounding in her own ears. If she
found herself face to face with him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She knew he was there
already, somewhere ahead. Surprise had to be on her side.</p>

<p>At the first landing, she paused. The hallways here
mirrored those below. They were just as empty, too, just as silent.
Had he gone on up?</p>

<p>The stair quivered faintly beneath her feet as if the
palace had been struck by a huge battering ram, then another.
Again, as a bar of white fire punched through the top of one of the
stone-screened windows, skewed wildly upward at an angle, then
winked out as it started to slice into the ceiling.</p>

<p>Nynaeve swallowed, blinking in a vain effort to rid
herself of the pale violet fan that hung across her vision in
memory of the thing. That had to be Rand, trying to strike at
Rahvin. If she was too close to him, Rand might catch her by
accident. If he was flailing like that&mdash;it had had the look
of flailing to her&mdash;he could catch her anywhere without
knowing it.</p>

<p>The quivers had ceased. Moghedien&rsquo;s eyes shone with
terror. By what Nynaeve felt through the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>, it was a
wonder the woman was not writhing on the floor, shrieking and
frothing at the mouth. Nynaeve felt a little like shrieking
herself. She made herself put her foot on the next step. Up was as
good a way as any. The second step was almost as hard. Slowly,
though. No need to come on him too suddenly. Surprise had to be on
his part. Moghedien followed like a whipped dog, shivering.</p>

<p>As Nynaeve climbed, she embraced <em>saidar</em> as
fully as she could, as much as Moghedien could handle, to the point
where the sweetness of it became almost a pain. That was the
warning. More, and she would approach the point where it was more
than she could take in, the point where she would still herself,
burn the ability to channel right out of herself. Or perhaps out of
Moghedien, under the circumstances. Or both of them. Any way at
all, it would be disaster now. She held that point though, the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>life</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;filling her a needle&rsquo;s light pressure just
short of breaking skin. It was as much as she could have embraced
had she been channeling on her own. She and Moghedien were much the
same strength in the Power; Tanchico had proved that. Was it
enough? Moghedien insisted the men were stronger. Rahvin, at least&mdash;Moghedien knew him&mdash;and it did not seem likely Rand
could have survived this long unless he was just as strong. It was
not fair that men should have the muscles and greater strength in
the Power too. The Aes Sedai in the Tower had always said they had
been equal. It just was not&mdash;</p>

<p>She was babbling. Taking a deep breath, she drew
Moghedien behind her off the staircase. This was as high as it
went.</p>

<p>This hall was empty. She went to where it met the
crossing corridor, peeked. And there he was. A tall black-clad man,
large, with wings of white in his dark hair, peering through the
curving slots of one of the stone window-screens at something
below. There was sweat and effort on his face, but he seemed to be
smiling. A handsome face, as handsome as Galad&rsquo;s, but she felt no
quickening of her breath for this one.</p>

<p>Whatever he was staring at&mdash;Rand perhaps?&mdash;had his full attention, but Nynaeve gave him no chance to
notice her. It might be Rand down there. She could not tell whether
Rahvin was channeling or not. She filled the corridor around him
with fire from wall to wall, floor to ceiling, pouring into it all
of <em>saidar</em> she held, fire so hot the stone itself smoked.
The heat made her flinch back.</p>

<p>Rahvin screamed in the middle of the flame&mdash;it
was one flame&mdash;and staggered away from her, back to where the
hallway became a columned walk. A heartbeat, less, while she still
flinched, and he stood, inside the flame but surrounded by clear
air. Every scrap of <em>saidar</em> she could channel was going
into that inferno, but he held it at bay. She could see him through
the fire; it gave everything a red cast, but she could see. Smoke
rose from his charred coat. His face was a seared ruin, one eye
milky white. But both eyes were malevolent as he turned them on
her.</p>

<p>No emotion reached her along the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>&rsquo;s
leash, only leaden dullness. Nynaeve&rsquo;s stomach fluttered. Moghedien
had given up. Given up because death was there for them.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Fire thrust through the carved window-screens above
Rand, fingers of it filling every hole, dancing toward the
colonnade. As it did, the struggle within him ceased abruptly. He
was himself so suddenly it was almost a shock. He had been drawing
desperately at <em>saidin</em>, trying to hold onto some of it. Now
it rushed into him, an avalanche of fire and ice that made his
knees buckle, made the Void tremble with pain that shaved at it
like a lathe.</p>

<p>And Rahvin stumbled backwards out onto the colonnade,
face turned to something inside. Rahvin wreathed in fire, yet
somehow standing as though untouched. If untouched now, it had not
been so before. Only the size of the figure, the impossibility of
it being anyone else, told Rand it was him. The Forsaken was a
figure of char and cracked red flesh that would have strained any
Healer to mend. The agony of it must have been overwhelming. Except
that Rahvin would be inside the Void within that burned remnant of
a man, wrapped in emptiness where the body&rsquo;s pain was distant and
<em>saidin</em> close at hand.</p>

<p><em>Saidin</em> raged inside Rand, and he loosed it
all. Not to Heal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rahvin!&rdquo; he screamed, and balefire flew from his
hands, molten light thicker than a man, driven by all the Power he
could draw.</p>

<p>It struck the Forsaken, and Rahvin ceased to exist.
The Darkhounds in Rhuidean had become motes before they vanished,
whatever kind of life they had had struggling to continue, or the
Pattern struggling to maintain itself even for them. Before this,
Rahvin simply&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ceased.</p>

<p>Rand let the balefire die, pushed <em>saidin</em>
away a little. Trying to blink away the purple afterimage, he
stared up at the wide hole in the marble balustrade, the remains of
one column a fang above it, stared at the matching hole in the
palace roofs They did not flicker, as if what he had done was too
strong even for this place to mend. After everything, it seemed
almost too easy. Perhaps there was something up there to convince
him Rahvin was really dead. He ran toward a door.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Frantically, Nynaeve threw everything into trying to
close the flame tight around Rahvin once more. The thought came
that she should have used lightning. She was going to die. Those
horrible eyes had fixed on Moghedien, not her, but she was going to
die too.</p>

<p>Liquid fire sliced up into the colonnade, so hot it
made the fire she had made seem cool. Shock made her release her
weaving, and she flung up a hand to protect her face, yet before it
had raised halfway, the liquid fire was gone. So was Rahvin. She
did not believe he had escaped. There had been an instant, so brief
she could almost have imagined it, when that white bar touched him
and he became&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;mist. Just an instant. She could have imagined.
But she did not believe so. She drew a shuddering breath.</p>

<p>Moghedien had her face in her hands, weeping,
trembling. The one emotion Nynaeve sensed through the
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em> was relief so powerful it drowned anything else.</p>

<p>Hurried boots grated on the stairs below.</p>

<p>Nynaeve spun, took a step toward the spiral
staircase. She was surprised to realize she was drinking deeply of
<em>saidar</em>, holding herself ready.</p>

<p>That surprise faded when Rand climbed into sight. He
was not as she remembered. His features were the same, but his face
was hard. Blue ice made his eyes. The bloody rips in his coat and
breeches, the blood on his face, seemed to suit that face.</p>

<p>The way he looked, she would not be surprised if he
killed Moghedien on the spot the instant he discovered who she was.
Nynaeve had uses for her yet. He would recognize an <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>.
Without another thought she changed it, let the leash vanish,
leaving only the silver bracelet on her wrist and the collar on
Moghedien. A moment of panic when she comprehended what she had
done, then a sigh as she realized that she still felt the other
woman. It worked exactly as Elayne had said it would. Perhaps he
had not seen. She was between him and Moghedien; the leash had
trailed behind her.</p>

<p>He barely glanced at Moghedien. &ldquo;I thought about
those flames, coming up here. I thought it might have been you or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Where is this? Is this where you meet Egwene?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Looking up at him, Nynaeve tried not to swallow. So
cold, that face. &ldquo;Rand, the Wise Ones say what you&rsquo;ve done, what
you are doing, is dangerous, even evil. They say you lose something
of yourself if you come here in the flesh, some part of what makes
you human.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do the Wise Ones know everything?&rdquo; He brushed past
her and stood staring at the colonnade. &ldquo;I used to think Aes Sedai
knew everything. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I don&rsquo;t know how human the
Dragon Reborn can afford to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand, I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She did not know what to say. &ldquo;Here,
let me Heal you at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held still for her to reach up and take his head
in her hands. For her part, she had to suppress a wince. His fresh
wounds were not serious, only numerous&mdash;what could have
bitten him; she was sure most of these were bites&mdash;but the
old wound, that half-healed, never-healing wound in his side, that
was a sinkhole of darkness, a well filled with what she thought the
taint of <em>saidin</em> must be like. She channeled the complex
flows, Air and Water, Spirit, even Fire and Earth in small amounts,
that made up Healing. He did not roar and flail about. He did not
even blink. He shivered. That was all. Then he took her wrists and
brought her hands down from his face. She was not reluctant. His
new injuries were gone, every bite and scrape and bruise, but not
the old wound. Nothing had changed about that. Anything short of
death should be capable of being Healed, even that. Anything!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; he asked quietly. &ldquo;Did you see him
die?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead, Rand. I saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded. &ldquo;But there are others still, aren&rsquo;t there?
Other&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Chosen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve felt a stabbing sliver of fear from
Moghedien, but she did not glance back. &ldquo;Rand, you must go. Rahvin
is dead, and this place is dangerous for you as you are. You must
go, and not come back here in the body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did nothing that she could see or feel&mdash;of
course, she could not&mdash;but for a moment she thought the
hallway behind him had&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;turned in some way. But it did not
look any different. Except&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She blinked. There was no
half-gone column in the colonnade beyond him, no hole in the stone
railing.</p>

<p>He went on as if nothing had happened. &ldquo;Tell Elayne&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Ask her not to hate me. Ask her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Pain twisted his face.
For a moment she saw the boy she had known, looking as though
something precious was being ripped away from him. She reached out
to comfort him, and he stepped back, his face stone again, and
bleak. &ldquo;Lan was right. Tell Elayne to forget me, Nynaeve. Tell her
I&rsquo;ve found something else to love, and there&rsquo;s no room left for
her. He wanted me to tell you the same thing. Lan has found someone
else, too. He said for you to forget him. Better never to have been
born than to love us.&rdquo; He stepped back again, three long steps, the
hall seemed to turn dizzyingly with him in it&mdash;or part of the
hall did&mdash;and he was gone.</p>

<p>Nynaeve stared at where he had been, and not at the
fitfully flickering reappearance of the damage to the colonnade.
Lan had told him to say <em>that</em>?</p>

<p>&ldquo;A&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;remarkable man,&rdquo; Moghedien said softly. &ldquo;A
very, very dangerous man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve stared at her. Something new was coming
through the bracelet to her. Fear was still there, but muted by&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Expectation might have been the best way to describe it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been helpful, have I not?&rdquo; Moghedien said.
&ldquo;Rahvin dead, Rand al&rsquo;Thor saved. None of it would have been
possible without me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve understood now. Hope more than expectation.
Sooner or later Nynaeve would have to wake. The <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>
would vanish. Moghedien was trying to remind her of her aid&mdash;as if it had not had to be wrenched out of her&mdash;just in case
Nynaeve might be steeling herself to kill before she went. &ldquo;It is
time for me to go, too,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. Moghedien&rsquo;s face did not
alter, but fear strengthened and so did hope. A large silver cup
appeared in Nynaeve&rsquo;s hand, apparently filled with tea. &ldquo;Drink
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moghedien edged back. &ldquo;What&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not poison. I could kill you easily enough without,
if that was my aim. After all, what happens to you here is real in
the waking world, too.&rdquo; Hope much stronger than fear now. &ldquo;It will
make you sleep. A deep sleep; too deep to touch
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. It&rsquo;s called forkroot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moghedien took the cup slowly. &ldquo;So I cannot follow
you? I will not argue.&rdquo; She tipped back her head and swallowed
until the cup was empty.</p>

<p>Nynaeve watched her. That much should put her down
quickly. Yet a cruel streak made her speak. She knew it was cruel
and did not care. Moghedien should not have any quiet rest at all.
&ldquo;You knew Birgitte was not dead.&rdquo; Moghedien&rsquo;s gaze narrowed
slightly. &ldquo;You knew who Faolain is.&rdquo; The other woman&rsquo;s eyes tried
to widen, but she was already drowsy. Nynaeve could feel the
forkroot&rsquo;s effects spreading. She concentrated on Moghedien, held
there in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. No easy sleep for one of the
Forsaken. &ldquo;And you knew who Siuan is, that she used to be the
Amyrlin Seat. I&rsquo;ve never mentioned that in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.
Never. I&rsquo;ll see you very shortly. In Salidar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moghedien&rsquo;s eyes rolled up her head. Nynaeve was not
sure whether it was the forkroot or a faint, but it did not matter.
She released the other woman, and Moghedien winked out. The silver
collar rang as it hit the floortiles. Elayne would be happy about
that, at least.</p>

<p>Nynaeve stepped out of the Dream.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Rand trotted along the corridors of the palace. There
seemed to be less damage than he remembered, but he did not really
look. He strode out into the great courtyard at the front of the
palace. Blasts of Air knocked the tall gates half off their hinges.
Beyond lay a huge oval plaza, and what he had been searching for.
Trollocs and Myrddraal. Rahvin was dead, and the other Forsaken
were elsewhere, but there were Trollocs and Myrddraal to kill in
Caemlyn.</p>

<p>They were fighting, a milling mass of hundreds,
perhaps thousands, surrounding something he could not see through
their black-mailed numbers, as tall as a Myrddraal on its horse.
Just barely he could make out his crimson banner deep in their
midst. Some swung round to face the palace as the gates were hurled
asunder.</p>

<p>Yet Rand stopped dead. Balls of fire rolled through
the packed black-mailed mass, and burning Trollocs lay everywhere.
It could not be.</p>

<p>Not daring to hope or think, he channeled. Shafts of
balefire leaped from his hands as fast as he could weave them,
narrower than his little finger, precise and cut off as soon as
they struck. They were much less powerful than the one he had used
against Rahvin at the end, than any he had used against Rahvin, but
he could not risk one slicing through to those trapped in the
center of all those Trollocs. It made little difference. The
first-struck Myrddraal seemed to reverse colors, become a
white-clad black shape, then it was drifting motes that vanished as
its horse fled madly. Trollocs, Myrddraal, every one that turned
toward him went the same, and then he began carving into the backs
of those still facing the other way, so a continuous haze of
sparkling dust seemed to fill the air, renewed as it
evaporated.</p>

<p>They could not stand against that. Bestial cries of
rage turned to howls of fear, and they fled in every direction
except toward him. He saw one Myrddraal try to turn them and be
trampled under, rider and horse, but the rest spurred their animals
away.</p>

<p>Rand let them go. He was busy staring at the veiled
Aiel bursting out of their encirclement with spears and
heavy-bladed knives. It was one of them carrying the banner; Aiel
did not carry banners, but this one, a bit of red headband showing
beneath his <em>shoufa</em>, did. There were battles going on down
some of the streets leading from the plaza, too. Aiel against
Trollocs. Townsfolk against Trollocs. Even armored men in the
uniform of the Queen&rsquo;s Guards against Trollocs. Apparently some who
were willing to kill a queen could not stomach Trollocs. Rand only
barely noticed, though. He was searching through the Aiel.</p>

<p>There. A woman in a white blouse, one hand holding up
her bulky skirts as she slashed at a fleeing Trolloc with a short
knife; an instant later flames enveloped the bear-snouted
figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aviendha!&rdquo; Rand did not know he was running until he
shouted. &ldquo;Aviendha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And there was Mat, coat torn and blood on his
sword-blade spearpoint, leaning on the black shaft watching the
Trollocs flee; content to let someone else do the fighting now that
that was possible. And Asmodean, sword held awkwardly and trying to
look every way at once in case any Trolloc decided to turn back.
Rand could sense <em>saidin</em> in him, though weakly; he did not
think much of Asmodean&rsquo;s fighting had been with that blade.</p>

<p>Balefire. Balefire that burned a thread out of the
Pattern. The stronger that balefire was, the further back that
burning went. And whatever that person had done <em>no longer had
happened</em>. He did not care if his blast at Rahvin had unraveled
half the Pattern. Not if this was the result.</p>

<p>He became aware of tears on his cheeks, and let
<em>saidin</em> and the Void go. He wanted to feel this.
&ldquo;Aviendha!&rdquo; Snatching her up, he whirled her around, with her
staring down at him as if he had gone mad. He did not want to put
her down, but he did. So he could hug Mat. Or try to.</p>

<p>Mat fended him off. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?
You&rsquo;d think you thought we were dead. Not that we weren&rsquo;t, almost.
Being a general has to be safer than this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re alive.&rdquo; Rand laughed. He brushed back
Aviendha&rsquo;s hair; she had lost her headscarf, and it hung loose
around her neck. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy you&rsquo;re alive. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took in the plaza again, and his joy faded.
Nothing could extinguish it, but the bodies lying in heaps where
the Aiel had made their stand lessened it. Too many of them were
not big enough to be men. There was Lamelle, veil gone and half her
throat as well; she would never make him soup again. Pevin, both
hands clutching the wrist-thick shaft of the Trolloc spear through
his chest and the first expression on his face Rand had ever seen.
Surprise. Balefire had cheated death for his friends, but not for
others. Too many. Too many Maidens.</p>

<p><em>Take what you can have. Rejoice in what you can
save, and do not mourn your losses too long</em>. It was not his
thought, but he took it. It seemed a good way to avoid going mad
before the taint on <em>saidin</em> drove him to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you go?&rdquo; Aviendha demanded. Not angrily.
If anything, she looked relieved. &ldquo;One second you were there, the
next you were gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had to kill Rahvin,&rdquo; he said quietly. She opened
her mouth, but he put his fingers over it to silence her, then
gently pushed her away. Take what you can have. &ldquo;Leave it at that.
He&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bael came limping up, <em>shoufa</em> still around
his head but veil hanging down his chest. There was blood on his
thigh, and on the point of his one remaining spear as well. &ldquo;The
Nightrunners and Shadowtwisted are running, <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>.
Some of the wetlanders have joined the dance against them. Even
some of the armored men, though they danced against us at first.&rdquo;
Sulin was behind him, unveiled, a nasty red gash across her
cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hunt them down however long it takes,&rdquo; Rand said. He
began walking, not sure where as long as it was away from Aviendha.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want them loose on the countryside. Keep an eye on the
Guards. I&rsquo;ll find out later which of them were Rahvin&rsquo;s men and
which&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He walked on, talking and not looking back. Take what
you can have.</p>
