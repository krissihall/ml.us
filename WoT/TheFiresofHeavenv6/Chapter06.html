<h4><em>Gateways</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">R</span>and
woke in total darkness and lay there beneath his
blankets trying to think of what had wakened him. It had been
something. Not the dream; he had been teaching Aviendha how to
swim, in a pond in the Waterwood back home in the Two Rivers.
Something else. Then it came again, like a faint whiff of a foul
miasma creeping under the door. Not a smell at all, really; a sense
of otherness, but that was how it felt. Rank, like something dead a
week in stagnant water. It faded again, but not all the way this
time.</p>

<p>Tossing aside his blankets, he stood up, wrapping
himself in <em>saidin</em>. Inside the Void, filled with the Power,
he could feel his body shiver, but the cold seemed in another
place from where he was. Cautiously he pulled open the door and
stepped out. Arched windows at either end of the corridor let in
falls of moonlight. After the pitch black of his room, it was
nearly like day. Nothing moved, but he could feel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;coming closer. Something evil. It felt like the taint that
roared through him on the Power.</p>

<p>One hand went to his coat pocket, to the small carved
figure of a round little man holding a sword across his knees. An
<em>angreal</em>; with that he could channel more of the Power than
even he could safely handle unaided. He thought it would not be
necessary. Whoever had sent this attack against him did not know
who they were dealing with, now. They should never have let him
wake.</p>

<p>For a moment, he hesitated. He could take the fight
to whatever had been sent against him, but he thought it was still
below him. Down where the Maidens were still sleeping, by the
silence. With luck, it would not bother them, unless he rushed down
to battle it in their midst. That would surely wake them, and they
would not stand by and watch. Lan said that you should choose your
ground, if you could, and make your enemy come to you.</p>

<p>Smiling, he raced the thud of his boots up the
nearest curving stairway, on upward, until he reached the top
floor. The highest level of the building was one large chamber with
a slightly domed ceiling and scattered thin columns fluted in
spirals. Glassless arched windows all around flooded every corner
with moonlight. The dust and grit and sand on the floor still
faintly showed his own footprints, from the one time he had come up
here, and no other mark. It was perfect.</p>

<p>Striding to the center of the room, he planted
himself atop the mosaic there, the ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai,
ten feet across. It was an apt place. &ldquo;Under this sign will he
conquer.&rdquo; That was what the Prophecy of Rhuidean said of him. He
stood straddling the sinuous dividing line, one boot on the black
teardrop that was now called the Dragon&rsquo;s Fang and used to
represent evil, the other on the white now called the Flame of Tar
Valon. Some men said it stood for the Light. An appropriate place
to meet this attack, between Light and darkness.</p>

<p>The fetid feel grew stronger, and a burned sulfur
smell filled the air. Suddenly things moved, slinking away from the
stairs like moonshadows, along the outside of the room. Slowly they
resolved into three black dogs, darker than night and big as
ponies. Eyes shining silver, they circled him warily. With the
Power in him, he could hear their hearts beat, like deep drums
pounding. He could not hear them breathe, though; perhaps they did
not.</p>

<p>He channeled, and a sword was in his hands, its
slightly curving, heron-marked blade seeming hammered out of fire.
He had expected Myrddraal, or something even worse than the
Eyeless, but for dogs, even Shadowspawn dogs, the sword would be
enough. Whoever had sent them did not know him. Lan said he had
very nearly reached the level of a blademaster, now, and the Warder
was sparing enough with praise to make him think he might have
passed onto that level already.</p>

<p>With snarls like bones being ground to dust, the dogs
hurtled at him from three sides, faster than galloping horses.</p>

<p>He did not move until they were almost on him; then
he flowed, one with the sword, move to move, as though dancing. In
the blink of an eye the sword form called Whirlwind on the Mountain
became The Wind Blows Over the Wall became Unfolding the Fan. Great
black heads flew apart from black bodies, their dripping teeth,
like burnished steel, still bared as they bounced across the floor.
He was already stepping from the mosaic as the dark forms collapsed
in twitching, bleeding heaps.</p>

<p>Laughing to himself, he let the sword go, though he
held on to <em>saidin</em>, to the raging Power, the sweetness and
the taint. Contempt slid along the outside of the Void. Dogs.
Shadowspawn, certainly, but still just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Laughter died.</p>

<p>Slowly, the dead dogs and their heads were melting,
settling into pools of liquid shadow that quivered slightly, as if
alive. Their blood fanned across the floor, trembled. Suddenly
the smaller pools flowed across the floor in viscous streams to
merge with the larger, which oozed away from the mosaic to mound
higher and higher, until the three huge black dogs stood there once
more, slavering and snarling as they gathered massive haunches
under them.</p>

<p>He did not know why he felt surprise, dim outside the
emptiness. Dogs, yes, but Shadowspawn. Whoever had sent them had
not been as careless as he had thought. But they still did not know
him.</p>

<p>Instead of reaching for the sword again, he channeled
as he remembered doing once long ago. Howling, the huge dogs
leaped, and a thick shaft of white light shot from his hands, like
molten steel, like liquid fire. He swept it across the springing
creatures; for an instant they became strange shadows of
themselves, all colors reversed, and then they were made of
sparkling motes that broke apart, smaller and smaller, until there
was nothing.</p>

<p>He let go of the thing he had made, with a grim
smile. A purple bar of light still seemed to cross his vision in
afterimage.</p>

<p>Across the great chamber a piece of one of the
columns crashed to the floor tiles. Where that bar of light&mdash;or whatever it had been; not light, exactly&mdash;had swung, neat
slices were gone from the columns. A gaping swath cut half the
width of the wall behind them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did any of them bite you, or bleed on you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spun at the sound of Moiraine&rsquo;s voice; absorbed in
what he had done, he had not heard her come up the stairs. She
stood clutching her skirts with both hands, peering at him, face
lost in moon-shadow. She would have sensed the things the same way
he did, but to be here so quickly she must have run. &ldquo;The Maidens
let you pass? Have you become <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>,
Moiraine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They grant me some privileges of a Wise One,&rdquo; she
said in a rush, impatience raw in her usually melodious voice. &ldquo;I
told the guards I had to speak with you urgently. Now, answer me!
Did the Darkhounds bite you, or bleed on you? Did their saliva
touch you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered slowly. Darkhounds. The little he
knew he had gotten from old stories, the sort used to frighten
children in the southlands. Some grown-ups believed, too. &ldquo;Why
should a bite worry you? You could Heal it. Does this mean the Dark
One is free?&rdquo; Enclosed in the Void as he was, even fear was
distant.</p>

<p>The tales he had heard said the Darkhounds ran the
night in the Wild Hunt, with the Dark One himself the hunter; they
left no print on even the softest dirt, only on stone, and they
would not stop until you faced and defeated them or put running
water between you. Crossroads were supposed to be particularly
dangerous places to meet them, and the time just after sunset or
just before sunrise. He had seen enough old stories walking by now
to believe that any of it could be true.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not that, Rand.&rdquo; She seemed to be regaining her
self-control; her voice was silver chimes again, calm and cool.
&ldquo;They are only another kind of Shadowspawn, something that should
never have been made. But their bite is death as surely as a dagger
in the heart, and I do not think I could have Healed such a wound
before it killed you. Their blood, even their saliva, is poison. A
drop on the skin can kill, slowly, with great pain at the end. You
are lucky there were only three: Unless you killed more before I
arrived? Their packs are usually larger, as many as ten or twelve,
or so say the scraps left from the War Of the Shadow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Larger packs. He was not the only target in Rhuidean
for one of the Forsaken&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must speak of what you used to kill them,&rdquo;
Moiraine began, but he was already running as hard as he could,
ignoring her cries to know where he was going and why.</p>

<p>Down flights of stairs, through darkened corridors
where sleepy Maidens, roused by the pounding boots, peered at him
in consternation from moonlit rooms. Through the front doors, where
Lan stood restlessly with the two women on guard, his
color-shifting Warder&rsquo;s cloak about his shoulders, making parts of
him seem to blend into the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Moiraine?&rdquo; he shouted as Rand dashed by,
but Rand leaped down the broad steps two at a time without
replying.</p>

<p>The half-healed wound in his side clenched like a
fist, pain he was only vaguely aware of inside the Void, by the
time he reached the building he sought. It stood at the very edge
of Rhuidean, far from the plaza, as far from the camp Moiraine
shared with the Wise Ones as it was possible to be and remain in
the city. The upper floors had collapsed in a mound of rubble that
fanned out onto the cracked earth beyond the pavement. Only the
bottom two floors remained whole. Refusing his body&rsquo;s efforts to
hunch over around the pain, he went in, still at a dead run.</p>

<p>Once the great antechamber, encircled by a stone
balcony, had been tall; now it was taller, open to the night sky,
its pale stone floor strewn with rubble from the collapse. In the
moonshadows beneath the balcony, three Darkhounds were up on their
hind legs, clawing and chewing at a bronze-clad door that shivered
under their assault. The smell of burned sulfur hung strong in the
air.</p>

<p>Remembering what had happened before, Rand darted to
one side as he channeled, the shaft of liquid white fire streaking
by the door as it destroyed the Shadowspawn. He had tried to make
it less this time, to confine the destruction to the Darkhounds,
but the thick wall at the far end of the chamber had a shadowed
hole in it. Not all the way through, he thought&mdash;it was hard
to tell by moonlight&mdash;but he would have to fine his control
of this weapon.</p>

<p>The bronze sheathing on the door was tattered and
torn as though the teeth and toenails of the Darkhounds really had
been steel; lamplight shone through a number of small holes. There
were pawprints in the floorstones, but surprisingly few. Releasing
<em>saidin</em>, he found a place where he would not cut his hand
to shreds and pounded on the door. Suddenly the pain in his side
was very real and present; he took a deep breath and tried to
thrust it away. &ldquo;Mat? It&rsquo;s me, Rand! Open up, Mat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a moment, the door opened a crack, letting out
a spill of lamplight; Mat peered through doubtfully, then pulled
the door wider, leaning against it as if he had run ten miles
carrying a sack of rocks. Except for a silver foxhead medallion
hanging around his neck, its eye shaped and shaded like the ancient
Aes Sedai symbol, he was naked. The way Mat felt about Aes Sedai,
Rand was surprised he had not sold the thing long since. Deeper in
the room, a tall, golden-haired woman was calmly wrapping a blanket
around herself. A Maiden, by the spears and buckler lying at her
feet.</p>

<p>Rand hastily averted his eyes and cleared his throat.
&ldquo;I just wanted to make sure you were all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re fine.&rdquo; Uneasily, Mat looked around the
antechamber. &ldquo;Now we are. You killed it, or something? I don&rsquo;t
want to know what it was, as long as it&rsquo;s gone. It&rsquo;s bloody hard on
a man sometimes, being your friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not only a friend. Another <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, and
perhaps a key to victory in Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don; anyone who wanted to
strike at Rand had reason to strike at Mat, as well. But Mat always
tried to deny both things. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re gone, Mat. Darkhounds. Three of
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you I didn&rsquo;t want to know,&rdquo; Mat groaned.
&ldquo;Darkhounds now. I can&rsquo;t say it isn&rsquo;t always something new around
you. A man wouldn&rsquo;t get bored; not until the day he died. If I
hadn&rsquo;t been on my feet for a drink of wine when the door started to
open&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He trailed off, shivering, and scratched a red place
on his right arm as he studied the ravaged metal sheathing. &ldquo;You
know, it&rsquo;s funny how the mind plays tricks. When I was putting
everything I had into holding this door shut, I could have sworn
one of them had chewed a hole right through it. I could see its
bloody head. And its teeth. Melindhra&rsquo;s spear didn&rsquo;t even faze
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moiraine&rsquo;s arrival was more spectacular this time,
running in, skirts held up, panting and fuming. Lan was at her
heels with his sword in hand and thunderclouds on his stone face,
and right behind, a throng of <em>Far Dareis Mai</em> that spilled
out into the street. Some of the Maidens wore no more than
smallclothes, but every one held her spears alertly and had her
<em>shoufa</em> wrapped around her head, black veil hiding all but
her eyes, ready to kill. Moiraine and Lan, at least, looked
relieved to see him standing there calmly talking to Mat, though.
The Aes Sedai also looked as if she meant to have strong words with
him. With the veils, it was impossible to tell what the Aiel
thought.</p>

<p>Letting out a loud yelp, Mat darted back into his
room and began hastily tugging on a pair of breeches, his capering
impeded by the way he kept trying to haul at the breeches and
scratch his arm at the same time. The golden-haired Maiden watched
with a broad grin that threatened to break into laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with your arm?&rdquo; Rand asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you the mind plays funny tricks,&rdquo; Mat said,
still trying to scratch and pull at the same time. &ldquo;When I thought
that thing chewed through the door, I thought it slobbered all over
my arm, too, and now it bloody itches like fire. Even looks like a
burn there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand opened his mouth, but Moiraine was already
pushing past him. Staring at her, Mat fell down while frantically
dragging his breeches on the rest of the way, but she knelt beside
him, ignoring his protests, clasping his head in her hands. Rand
had been Healed before, and seen it done, but instead of what he
expected, Mat only gave a shiver and lifted up the medallion by its
leather thong so that it hung against his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bloody thing is colder than ice all of a sudden,&rdquo; he
muttered. &ldquo;What are you doing, Moiraine? If you want to do
something, Heal this itch; it has my whole arm now.&rdquo; His right arm
was red from wrist to shoulder, and had begun to look puffy.</p>

<p>Moiraine stared at him with the most startled
expression Rand had ever seen on her face. Maybe the only one. &ldquo;I
will,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;If the medallion is cold, take it
off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat frowned at her, then finally pulled it over his
head and laid it beside him. She took his head again, and he gave a
shout as if he had been ducked headfirst into ice; his legs
stiffened and his back arched; his eyes stared at nothing, as wide
as they would go. When Moiraine took her hands away, he slumped,
gulping air. The redness and swelling were gone. It took three
tries before he could speak. &ldquo;Blood and&mdash;Does it have to be
that flaming way every flaming time? It was just a bloody
itch!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You watch your tongue with me,&rdquo; Moiraine told him,
getting up, &ldquo;or I will find Nynaeve and put her in charge of you.&rdquo;
But her heart was not in it; she could have been talking in her
sleep. She was trying not to stare at the foxhead as Mat hung it
back around his neck. &ldquo;You will need rest,&rdquo; she said absently.
&ldquo;Stay in bed tomorrow, if you feel like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Maiden in the blanket&mdash;Melindhra?&mdash;knelt behind Mat and put her hands on his shoulders, looking up at
Moiraine over his head. &ldquo;I will see that he does as you say, Aes
Sedai.&rdquo; With a sudden grin, she ruffled his hair. &ldquo;He is my little
mischief maker, now.&rdquo; From the horrified look on Mat&rsquo;s face, he was
gathering his strength to run.</p>

<p>Rand became aware of soft, amused chuckles behind
him. The Maidens, <em>shoufas</em> and veils around their shoulders
now, had crowded around and were peering into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Teach him to sing, spear-sister,&rdquo; Adelin said, and
the other Maidens crowed with laughter.</p>

<p>Rand rounded on them firmly. &ldquo;Let the man rest. Don&rsquo;t
some of you have to put on clothes?&rdquo; They gave way reluctantly,
still trying to peer into the room, until Moiraine came out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you leave us, please?&rdquo; the Aes Sedai said as
the mangled door banged shut behind her. She half looked back with
a vexed tightening of her mouth. &ldquo;I must speak with Rand al&rsquo;Thor
alone.&rdquo; Nodding, the Aiel women started for the door, some still
jesting about whether Melindhra&mdash;a Shaido, it seemed; Rand
wondered if Mat knew that&mdash;would teach Mat to sing. Whatever
that meant.</p>

<p>Rand stopped Adelin with a hand on her bare arm;
others who noticed stopped as well, so he spoke to them all. &ldquo;If
you will not go when I tell you to, what will you do if I have to
use you in battle?&rdquo; He did not intend to if he could help it; he
knew they were fierce warriors, but he had been raised to believe
it was a man&rsquo;s place to die if necessary before a woman had to.
Logic might say it was foolish, especially with women like this,
but that was how he felt. He knew better than to tell them that,
however. &ldquo;Will you think it a joke, or decide to go in your own
good time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They looked at him with the consternation of those
listening to someone who had revealed his ignorance of the simplest
facts. &ldquo;In the dance of spears,&rdquo; Adelin told him, &ldquo;we will go as
you direct, but this is not the dance. Besides, you did not tell us
to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> is not a wetlander
king,&rdquo; a gray-haired Maiden added. Sinewy and hard despite her age,
she wore only a short shift and her <em>shoufa</em>. He was getting
tired of that phrase.</p>

<p>The Maidens resumed their joking as they left him
alone with Moiraine and Lan. The Warder had finally put up his
sword, and looked as at ease as he ever did. Which was to say as
still and calm as his face, all stony planes and angles in the
moonlight, and with an air of being on the brink of sudden movement
that made the Aiel appear placid in comparison. A braided leather
cord held Lan&rsquo;s hair, graying at the temples, back from his face.
His gaze could have come from a blue-eyed hawk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must speak with you about&mdash;&rdquo; Moiraine
began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can talk tomorrow,&rdquo; Rand said, cutting her off.
Lan&rsquo;s face hardened further, if such was possible; Warders were far
more protective of their Aes Sedai, of their position as well as
their persons, than they were of themselves. Rand ignored Lan. His
side still wanted to hunch him over, but he managed to keep erect;
he was not about to show her any weakness. &ldquo;If you think I&rsquo;ll help
you get that foxhead away from Mat, you can think again.&rdquo; Somehow
that medallion had stopped her channeling. Or at least it had
stopped her channeling from affecting Mat while he touched it. &ldquo;He
paid a hard price for it, Moiraine, and it is his.&rdquo; Thinking of how
she had thumped his shoulders with the Power, he added dryly,
&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll ask if I can borrow it from him.&rdquo; He turned away from
her. There was still one he had to check on, though one way or
another the urgency was gone; the Darkhounds would have done what
they intended by now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Rand,&rdquo; Moiraine said, and the open pleading
in her voice halted him in his tracks. He had never heard anything
like that from her before.</p>

<p>The tone seemed to offend Lan. &ldquo;I thought you had
become a man,&rdquo; the Warder said harshly. &ldquo;Is this how a man behaves?
You act like an arrogant boy.&rdquo; Lan practiced the sword with him&mdash;and liked him, Rand thought&mdash;but if Moiraine said the
right word, the Warder would do his best to kill him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not be with you forever,&rdquo; Moiraine said
urgently. Her hands gripped her skirts so hard that they trembled.
&ldquo;I might die in the next attack. I could fall from my horse and
break my neck, or take a Darkfriend&rsquo;s arrow through my heart, and
death cannot be Healed. I have given my entire life to the search
for you, to find you and help you. You still do not know your own
strength; you cannot know half of what you do. I&mdash;apologize&mdash;most humbly for any offense I have given you.&rdquo; Those words&mdash;words he had never thought to hear from her&mdash;came out
as if dragged, but they came; and she could not lie. &ldquo;Let me help
you as much as I can, while I can. Please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to trust you, Moiraine.&rdquo; He disregarded
Lan, shifting in the moonlight; his attention was all on her. &ldquo;You
have dandled me like a puppet, made me dance the way you wanted,
from the day we met. The only times I&rsquo;ve been free of you were
either when you were far away or when I ignored you. And you make
even that hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her laugh was as silvery as the moon above, but
bitterness tinged it. &ldquo;It has been more like wrestling with a bear
than pulling strings on a puppet. Do you want an oath not to try
manipulating you? I give it.&rdquo; Her voice hardened to crystal. &ldquo;I
even swear to obey you like one of the Maidens&mdash;like one of
the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, if you require&mdash;but you must&mdash;&rdquo;
Taking a deep breath, she began again, more softly. &ldquo;I <em>ask</em>
you, humbly, to allow me to help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lan was staring at her, and Rand thought his own eyes
must be popping out of his head. &ldquo;I will accept your help,&rdquo; he said
slowly. &ldquo;And I apologize, too. For all the rudeness I&rsquo;ve shown.&rdquo; He
had the feeling he was still being manipulated&mdash;he had had
good cause to be rude, when he was&mdash;but she could not lie.</p>

<p>Tension drained from her visibly. She stepped closer
to look up at him. &ldquo;What you used to kill the Darkhounds is called
balefire. I can still sense the residue of it here.&rdquo; He could, too,
like the fading smell remaining after a pie was carried out of the
room, or the memory of something just snatched out of sight. &ldquo;Since
before the Breaking of the World, the use of balefire has been
forbidden. The White Tower forbids us even to learn it. In the War
of Power, the Forsaken and the Shadowsworn themselves used it only
reluctantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forbidden?&rdquo; Rand said, frowning. &ldquo;I saw you use it
once.&rdquo; He could not be sure in the pale light of the moon, but he
thought color flamed in her cheeks. For this once, perhaps she was
the one off balance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes it is necessary to do that which is
forbidden.&rdquo; If she was flustered, it did not show in her voice.
&ldquo;When anything is destroyed with balefire, it ceases to exist <em>
before</em> the moment of its destruction, like a thread that burns
away from where the flame touched it. The greater the power of the
balefire, the further back in time it ceases to exist. The
strongest I can manage will remove only a few seconds from the
Pattern. You are much stronger. Very much so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if it doesn&rsquo;t exist <em>before</em> you destroy
it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Rand raked fingers through his hair in confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You begin to see the problems, the dangers? Mat
remembers seeing one of the Darkhounds chew through the door, but
there is no opening, now. If it had slavered on him as much as he
remembers, he would have been dead before I could reach him. For as
far back as you destroyed the creature, whatever it did during that
time <em>no longer happened</em>. Only the memories remain, for
those who saw or experienced it. Only what it did before is real,
now. A few tooth holes in the door, and one drop of saliva on Mat&rsquo;s
arm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds just fine to me,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Mat&rsquo;s
alive because of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is terrible, Rand.&rdquo; An urgent note entered her,
voice. &ldquo;Why do you think even the Forsaken feared to use it? Think
of the effect on the Pattern of a single thread, one man, removed
from hours, or days, that have already been woven, like one thread
picked partly out of a piece of cloth. Fragments of manuscripts
remaining from the War of Power say several entire cities were
destroyed with balefire before both sides realized the dangers.
Hundreds of thousands of threads pulled from the Pattern, gone for
days already past; whatever those people had done, now no longer
had been done, and neither had what others had done because of
their actions. The memories remained, but not the actions. The
ripples were incalculable. The Pattern itself nearly unraveled. It
could have been the destruction of everything. World, time,
Creation itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shivered, nothing to do with the cold cutting
through his coat. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t promise not to use it again, Moiraine.
You yourself said there are times when it&rsquo;s necessary to do what&rsquo;s
forbidden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not think that you would,&rdquo; she said coolly.
Her agitation was vanishing, her balance restored. &ldquo;But you must be
careful.&rdquo; She was back to &ldquo;must&rdquo; again. &ldquo;With a <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>
like <em>Callandor</em>, you could annihilate a city with balefire.
The Pattern could be disrupted for years to come. Who can say that
the weave would even remain centered on you, <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> as
you are, until it settled down? Being <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, and so
strongly so, may be your margin of victory, even in the Last
Battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it will,&rdquo; he said bleakly. In tale after
heroic tale, the protagonist proclaimed he would have victory or
death. It seemed that the best he could hope for was victory <em>
and</em> death. &ldquo;I have to check on someone,&rdquo; he went on quietly.
&ldquo;I will see you in the morning.&rdquo; Gathering the Power into him, life
and death in swirling layers, he made a hole in the air taller than
he was, opening into blackness that made the moonlight seem day. A
gateway, Asmodean called it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; Moiraine gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once I&rsquo;ve done something, I remember how. Most of
the time.&rdquo; That was no answer, but it was time to test Moiraine&rsquo;s
vows. She could not lie, but Aes Sedai could find loopholes in a
stone. &ldquo;You are to leave Mat alone tonight. And you won&rsquo;t try to
take that medallion away from him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It belongs in the Tower for study, Rand. It must be
a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, but none has ever been found that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever it is,&rdquo; he said firmly, &ldquo;it is his. You
will leave it with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment she seemed to struggle with herself,
back stiffening and head coming up as she stared at him. She could
not be used to taking orders from anyone except Siuan Sanche, and
Rand was willing to wager she had never done that without a tussle.
Finally she nodded, and even made the suggestion of a curtsy. &ldquo;As
you say, Rand. It is his. Please be careful, Rand. Learning a thing
like balefire by yourself can be suicide, and death cannot be
Healed.&rdquo; This time there was no mockery. &ldquo;Until the morning.&rdquo; Lan
followed her as she left, the Warder giving Rand an unreadable
expression; he would not be pleased by this turn of events.</p>

<p>Rand stepped through the gateway, and it
vanished.</p>

<p>He was standing on a disc, a six-foot copy of the
ancient Aes Sedai symbol. Even the black half of it seemed lighter
against the endless darkness that surrounded him, above and below;
he was sure that if he fell off, he would fall forever. Asmodean
claimed there was a faster method, called Traveling, for using a
gateway, but he had not been able to teach it, partly because he
did not have the strength to make a gateway while wearing Lanfear&rsquo;s
shield. In any case, Traveling required that you know your starting
point very well. It seemed more logical to him that you should have
to know where you were heading well, but Asmodean seemed to think
that that was like asking why air was not water. There was a great
deal that Asmodean took for granted. Anyway, Skimming was fast
enough.</p>

<p>As soon as he planted his boots on it, the disc
lurched what seemed to be a foot and stopped, another gateway
appearing in front of it. Fast enough, especially over this short
distance. Rand stepped into the hallway outside the room where
Asmodean was.</p>

<p>The moon through the windows at the ends of the
corridor gave the only light; Asmodean&rsquo;s lamp was out. The flows he
had woven around the room were still in place, still firmly tied.
Nothing moved, but there was still a faint smell of burned
sulphur.</p>

<p>Moving close to the bead curtain, he peered through
the doorway. Moonshadows filled the room, but one of them was
Asmodean, tossing in his blankets. Wrapped in the Void, Rand could
hear his heartbeat, smell the sweat of troubled dreams. He bent to
examine the pale blue floor tiles, and the prints impressed in
them.</p>

<p>He had learned to track as a boy, and reading them
was no difficulty. Three or four Darkhounds had been there. They
had approached the doorway one by one, it seemed, each stepping
almost in the others&rsquo; footprints. Had the net woven around the room
stopped them there? Or had they merely been sent to look, and
report? Troubling, to think of even Shadowspawn dogs having that
much intelligence. But then, Myrddraal used ravens and rats for
spies, too, and other animals closely linked to death. Shadoweyes,
the Aiel called them.</p>

<p>Channeling fine flows of Earth, he smoothed out the
floor tiles, lifting up the compressions until he was out in the
empty, night-cloaked street and a hundred paces from the tall
building. In the morning, anyone would be able to see the trail
ending there, but none would suspect that the Darkhounds had gone
anywhere near Asmodean. Darkhounds could have no interest in Jasin
Natael the gleeman.</p>

<p>Every Maiden in the city was likely awake by this
time; certainly none would still be asleep under the Roof of the
Maidens. Making another gateway there in the street, a deeper
blackness against the night, he let the disc carry him back to his
own room. He wondered why he had chosen the ancient symbol&mdash;it was his choice, if unconscious; other times it had been a
stairstep or a piece of floor. The Darkhounds had oozed away from
that sign before re-forming. <em>Under this sign will he
conquer</em>.</p>

<p>Standing in his pitch-black bedchamber, he channeled
the lamps alight, but he did not let go of <em>saidin</em>. Instead
he channeled again, careful not to spring any of his own traps, and
a piece of the wall vanished, revealing a niche he had carved there
himself.</p>

<p>In the little alcove stood two figurines a foot tall,
a man and a woman, each in flowing robes and serene of face, each
holding a crystal globe aloft in one hand. He had lied to Asmodean
about them.</p>

<p>There were <em>angreal</em>, like the round little
man in Rand&rsquo;s coat pocket, and <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>, like <em>
Callandor</em>, that increased the amount of the Power that could
be safely handled as much over <em>angreal</em> as <em>angreal</em>
did over channeling unaided. Both were very rare, and prized by Aes
Sedai, though they could only recognize those attuned to women and
<em>saidar</em>. These two figures were something else, not so
rare, but just as highly valued. <em>Ter&rsquo;angreal</em> had been made
to use the Power, not magnify it, but to use it in specific ways.
The Aes Sedai did not know the intended purpose even of most <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> they had in the White Tower; some they used, but
without knowing whether the use they put them to was anything like
the function they had been made for. Rand knew the function of
these two.</p>

<p>The male figure could link him to a huge replica of
itself, the most powerful male <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> ever made, even
if he were on the other side of the Aryth Ocean from it. It had
only been finished after the Dark One&rsquo;s prison was resealed&mdash;<em>How do I know that?</em>&mdash;and hidden before any of the
male Aes Sedai going mad could find it. The female figure could do
the same for a woman, joining her to the female equivalent of the
great statue he hoped was still almost completely buried in
Cairhien. With that much power&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Moiraine had said death could
not be Healed.</p>

<p>Unbidden, unwanted, memory returned of the
next-to-last time he had dared let himself hold <em>Callandor</em>,
images floating beyond the Void.</p>

<p><em>The body of the dark-haired girl, little more
than a child, lay sprawled with eyes wide and fixed on the ceiling,
blood blackening the bosom of her dress where a Trolloc had run her
through</em>.</p>

<p><em>The Power was in him</em>. Callandor <em>blazed,
and he was the Power. He channeled, directing flows into the
child&rsquo;s body, searching, trying, fumbling; she lurched to her feet,
arms and legs unnaturally rigid and jerky</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Rand, you cannot do this,&rdquo; Moiraine cried. &ldquo;Not
this!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>Breathe. She had to breathe. The girl&rsquo;s chest
rose and fell. Heart. Had to beat. Blood already thick and dark
oozed from the wound in her chest</em>. Live, burn you! <em>his
mind howled</em>. I didn&rsquo;t mean to be too late! <em>Her eyes stared
at him, filmed, heedless of all the Power in him. Lifeless. Tears
trickled unheeded down his cheeks</em>.</p>

<p>He forced the memory away roughly; even encased in
the Void, it hurt. With this much Power&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;With this much Power,
he could not be trusted. &ldquo;You are not the Creator,&rdquo; Moiraine had
told him as he stood over that child. But with that male figure,
with only half of its power, he had made the mountains move, once.
With far less, with only <em>Callandor</em>, he had been sure he
could turn back the Wheel, make a dead child live. Not only the One
Power was seductive; the power of it was, too. He should destroy
them both. Instead he re-wove the flows, reset the traps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing there?&rdquo; a woman&rsquo;s voice said as
the wall became apparently whole again.</p>

<p>Tying off the flows hastily&mdash;and the knot with
its own deadly surprises&mdash;he pulled the Power into him and
turned.</p>

<p>Beside Lanfear, in her white and silver, Elayne or
Min or Aviendha would look almost ordinary. Her dark eyes alone
were enough to make a man give up his soul. At the sight of her,
his stomach clenched until he wanted to vomit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he demanded. Once he had blocked
Egwene and Elayne both from the True Source, but he could not
remember how. So long as Lanfear could touch the Source, he had
more chance of catching the wind in his hands than of holding her
prisoner. <em>One flash of balefire, and</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He could not do
it. She was one of the Forsaken, but the memory of a woman&rsquo;s head
rolling on the ground stopped him dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have two of them,&rdquo; she said finally. &ldquo;I thought
I glimpsed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;One is a woman, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Her smile could have
halted a man&rsquo;s heart and made him grateful. &ldquo;You are beginning to
consider my plan, aren&rsquo;t you? With those, together, the other
Chosen will kneel at our feet. We can supplant the Great Lord
himself, challenge the Creator. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were always ambitious, Mierin.&rdquo; His voice grated
in his ears. &ldquo;Why do you think I turned away from you? It wasn&rsquo;t
Ilyena, whatever you like to think. You were out of my heart long
before ever I met her. Ambition is all there is to you. Power is
all you ever wanted. You disgust me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stared at him, both hands pressed hard against
her stomach, her dark eyes even larger than usual. &ldquo;Graendal said&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; she began faintly. Swallowing, she began again. &ldquo;Lews Therin?
I love you, Lews Therin. I have always loved you, and I always
will. You know that. You must!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s face was like rock; he hoped it hid his shock.
He had no idea where his words had come from, but it seemed he
could remember her. A dim memory, from before. <em>I am not Lews
Therin Telamon!</em> &ldquo;I am Rand al&rsquo;Thor!&rdquo; he said harshly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you are.&rdquo; Studying him, she nodded slowly
to herself. That cool composure returned. &ldquo;Of course. Asmodean has
been telling you things, about the War of Power, and me. He lies.
You did love me. Until that yellow-haired trollop Ilyena stole
you.&rdquo; For an instant, rage made her face a contorted mask; he did
not think she was even aware of it. &ldquo;Did you know that Asmodean
severed his own mother? What they call stilling, now. Severed her,
and let Myrddraal drag her away screaming. Can you trust a man like
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand laughed aloud. &ldquo;After I caught him, you helped
trap him so he had to teach me. And now you say I cannot trust
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For teaching.&rdquo; She sniffed dismissively. &ldquo;He will do
that because he knows his lot is cast with you for good. Even if he
managed to convince the others that he has been a prisoner, they
would still tear him apart, and he knows it. The weakest dog in the
pack often suffers that fate. Besides, I watch his dreams on
occasion. He dreams of you triumphing over the Great Lord and
putting him up beside you on high. Sometimes he dreams of me.&rdquo; Her
smile said those dreams were pleasant for her, but not so for
Asmodean. &ldquo;But he will try to turn you against me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo; he demanded. Turn against her? No
doubt she was full of the Power right that moment, ready to shield
him if she even suspected he meant to try anything. She had done it
before, with humiliating ease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like you like this. Arrogant and proud, full of
your own strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once she had said that she liked him unsure, that
Lews Therin had been too arrogant. &ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rahvin sent the Darkhounds after you tonight,&rdquo; she
said calmly, folding her hands at her waist. &ldquo;I would have come
sooner, to help you, but I cannot let the others know I am on your
side yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On his side. One of the Forsaken loved him, or rather
the man he had been three thousand years ago, and all she wanted
was for him to give his soul to the Shadow and rule the world with
her. Or a step below her, at least. That, and try to replace both
the Dark One and the Creator. Was she completely mad? Or could the
power of those two huge <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> really be as great as
she claimed? That was a direction he did not want his thoughts to
take.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why would Rahvin choose now to attack me? Asmodean
says he looks to his own interests, that he&rsquo;ll sit to one side even
in the Last Battle, if he can, and wait for the Dark One to destroy
me. Why not Sammael, or Demandred? Asmodean says they hate me.&rdquo;
<em>Not me. They hate Lews Therin</em>. But to the Forsaken, that
was the same thing. <em>Please, Light, I am Rand al&rsquo;Thor</em>. He
pushed away a sudden memory of this woman in his arms, both of them
young and just learning what they could do with the Power. <em>I am
Rand al&rsquo;Thor!</em> &ldquo;Why not Semirhage, or Moghedien, or
Graen&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you <em>are</em> impinging on his interests
now.&rdquo; She laughed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know where he is? In Andor, in
Caemlyn itself. He rules there in all but name. Morgase simpers and
dances for him, her and half a dozen others.&rdquo; Her lip curled in
disgust. &ldquo;He has men scouring town and countryside to find new
pretties for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment shock held him. Elayne&rsquo;s mother in the
hands of one of the Forsaken. Yet he dared not show concern.
Lanfear had displayed her jealousy more than once; she was capable
of hunting Elayne down and killing her, if she even thought he had
feelings for her. <em>What</em> do <em>I feel for her?</em> Aside
from that, one hard fact floated beyond the Void, cold and cruel in
its truth. He would not run off to attack Rahvin even if what
Lanfear said was true. <em>Forgive me, Elayne, but I can&rsquo;t</em>.
She might well be lying&mdash;she would weep no tears for any of
the other Forsaken he killed; they all stood in the way of her own
plans&mdash;but in any event, he was done with reacting to what
others did. If he reacted, they could reason out what he would do.
Let them react to him, and be as surprised as Lanfear and Asmodean
had been.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does Rahvin think I&rsquo;ll rush to defend Morgase?&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I have seen her once in my life. The Two Rivers is part of
Andor on a map, but I never saw a Queen&rsquo;s Guardsman there. No one
has in generations. Tell a Two Rivers man Morgase is his queen, and
he&rsquo;ll probably think you&rsquo;re crazy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt Rahvin expects you to run to defend your
homeland,&rdquo; Lanfear said wryly, &ldquo;but he will expect you to defend
your ambitions. He means to sit Morgase on the Sun Throne, too, and
use her like a puppet until the time he can come into the open.
More Andoran soldiers move into Cairhien every day. And you sent
Tairen soldiers north, to secure your own hold on the land. No
wonder that he attacked you as soon as he found you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. It had not been that way at
all, sending the Tairens, but he did not expect her to understand.
Or believe him if he told her, for that matter. &ldquo;I thank you for
the warning.&rdquo; Politeness to one of the Forsaken! Of course, there
was nothing he could do except hope that some of what she told him
was truth. <em>A good reason not to kill her. She&rsquo;ll tell you more
than she thinks, if you listen carefully</em>. He hoped that was
his own thought, chill and cynical as it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ward your dreams against me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Against everyone.&rdquo; That was simple truth, though she
was at least as prominent in the list as the Wise Ones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dreams are mine. You and your dreams are mine
especially.&rdquo; Her face remained smooth, but her voice hardened. &ldquo;I
can break through your warding. You would not like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To show his unconcern, he sat down on the foot of his
pallet, legs folded and hands on his knees. He thought his face was
as calm as hers. Inside him, the Power swelled. He had flows of Air
ready to bind her, and flows of Spirit. That was what wove a shield
against the True Source. The racking of his brain for the how of it
seemed far off, but he could not remember anyway. Without that, the
other was useless. She could pick apart or slice through anything
he wove, even if she could not see it. Asmodean was trying to teach
him that trick, but it was hard going without a woman&rsquo;s weaving to
practice on.</p>

<p>Lanfear eyed him in a disconcerted fashion, a slight
frown marring her beauty. &ldquo;I have examined the Aiel women&rsquo;s dreams.
These so-called Wise Ones. They do not know how to shield
themselves very well. I could frighten them till they never dream
again, never even think of invading yours, surely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you would not help me openly.&rdquo; He did not
dare tell her to leave the Wise Ones alone; she might well do
something to spite him. She had made it plain from the start, if
not in words, that she meant to have the upper hand between them.
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that risk another of the Forsaken finding out? You aren&rsquo;t
the only one who knows how to enter people&rsquo;s dreams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Chosen,&rdquo; she said absently. For a moment she
chewed a full underlip. &ldquo;I have watched the girl&rsquo;s dreams, too.
Egwene. Once I thought you had feelings for her. Do you know who
she dreams of? Morgase&rsquo;s son and stepson. The son, Gawyn, most
often.&rdquo; Smiling, she put on a tone of mock shock. &ldquo;You would not
believe a simple country girl could have such dreams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was trying to test his jealousy, he realized.
She really thought he warded his dreams to hide thoughts of another
woman! &ldquo;The Maidens guard me closely,&rdquo; he said dryly. &ldquo;If you want
to know how close, look at Isendre&rsquo;s dreams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Spots of color flared in her cheeks. Of course. He
was not supposed to see what she was trying. Confusion rolled
outside the Void. Or did she think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Isendre? Lanfear knew she
was a Darkfriend. Lanfear had brought Kadere and the woman to the
Waste in the first place. And planted most of the jewelry Isendre
was accused of stealing; Lanfear&rsquo;s spite was cruel even when petty.
Still, if she thought he could love her, Isendre being a Darkfriend
was probably no obstacle in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have let them send her off to try reaching
the Dragonwall,&rdquo; he went on casually, &ldquo;but who knows what she might
have said to save herself? I must protect her and Kadere to some
extent in order to protect Asmodean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The color faded, but as she opened her mouth again, a
knock came at the door. Rand bounded to his feet. No one would
recognize Lanfear, yet if a woman were discovered in his room, a
woman whom none of the Maidens below had seen enter, questions
would be asked and he had no answers.</p>

<p>But Lanfear already had a gateway open, to somewhere
full of white silk hangings and silver. &ldquo;Remember that I am your
only hope of surviving, my love.&rdquo; It was a very cool voice in which
to call someone that. &ldquo;Beside me, you need fear nothing. Beside me,
you can rule everything that is or will be.&rdquo; Lifting her snowy
skirts, she stepped through, and the gateway winked shut.</p>

<p>The knock sounded again before he could make himself
push away <em>saidin</em> and haul open the door.</p>

<p>Enaila peered past him suspiciously, muttering, &ldquo;I
thought perhaps Isendre&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She gave him an accusing look.
&ldquo;Spear-sisters are searching everywhere for you. No one saw you
return.&rdquo; With a shake of her head, she straightened; she always
tried to stand as tall as possible. &ldquo;The chiefs have come to speak
with the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>,&rdquo; she said formally. &ldquo;They wait
below.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They waited on the columned portico, as it turned
out, being men. The sky was still dark, but the first glimmers of
dawn lined the mountains to the east. If they felt any impatience
with the two Maidens who stood between them and the tall doors, it
did not show on their shadowed faces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Shaido are moving,&rdquo; Han barked as soon as Rand
appeared. &ldquo;And the Reyn, the Miagoma, the Shiande&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Every
clan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joining Couladin, or me?&rdquo; Rand demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Shaido are moving toward the Jangai Pass,&rdquo;
Rhuarc said. &ldquo;For the others, it is too early to tell. But they are
on the march with every spear not needed to defend the holds, herds
and flocks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand only nodded. All of his determination not to let
anyone else dictate what he would do, and now this. Whatever the
other clans intended, Couladin had to plan a crossing into
Cairhien. So much for his grand schemes of imposing peace, if the
Shaido ravaged Cairhien even further while he sat in Rhuidean
waiting for the other clans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we move for the Jangai, too,&rdquo; he said
finally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We cannot catch him if he means to cross,&rdquo; Erim
cautioned, and Han added sourly, &ldquo;If any of the others are joining
him, we will be caught strung out like blindworms in the sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t sit here until I find out,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;If I
can&rsquo;t catch Couladin, I mean to be right behind him into Cairhien.
Rouse the spears. We leave as soon after first light as you can
manage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Giving him that odd Aiel bow used only on the most
formal occasions, one foot forward and one hand extended, the
chiefs departed. Only Han said anything. &ldquo;To Shayol Ghul
itself.&rdquo;</p>
