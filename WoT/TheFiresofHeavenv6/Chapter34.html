<h4><em>A Silver Arrow</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>layne
had the cooking that evening, which meant that
none of the food was simple, despite the fact that they were eating
on stools around a cookfire, with crickets chirping in the
surrounding woods, and now and again some night-bird&rsquo;s thin, sad
cry in the deepening darkness. The soup was served cold and
jellied, with chopped green ferris sprinkled on top. The Light knew
where she had found ferris, or the tiny onions she put in with the
peas. The beef was sliced nearly thin enough to see through and
wrapped around something made from carrots, sweetbeans, chives and
goatcheese, and there was even a small honey-cake for dessert.</p>

<p>It was all tasty, though Elayne fretted that nothing
was exactly the way it should be, as if she thought she could
duplicate the cooks&rsquo; work in the Royal Palace in Caemlyn. Nynaeve
was fairly sure the girl was not fishing for compliments. Elayne
would always brush away compliments and tell you exactly what was
not right. Thom and Juilin grumbled about there being so little
beef, but Nynaeve noticed that they not only ate every scrap but
looked disappointed when the last pea was gone. When she cooked,
for some reason they always seemed to eat at one of the other
wagons. When one of them made supper, it was always stew or else
meat and beans so full of dried peppers that your tongue
blistered.</p>

<p>They did not eat alone, of course. Luca saw to that,
bringing his own stool and placing it right next to her, his red
cloak spread to best effect and his long legs stretched out so that
his calves showed well, above his turned-down boots. He was there
almost every night. Oddly, the only nights he missed were when she
cooked.</p>

<p>It was interesting, really, having his eyes on her
when a woman as pretty as Elayne was there, but he did have his
motives. He sat altogether too close&mdash;tonight she moved her
stool three times, but he followed without missing a word or
seeming to notice&mdash;and he alternated comparing her with
various flowers, to the blossoms&rsquo; detriment, ignoring the black eye
he could not miss without being blind, and musing over how
beautiful she would be in that red dress, with compliments on her
courage thrown in. Twice, he slipped in suggestions that they take
a stroll by moonlight, hints so veiled that she was not entirely
sure that was what they were until she thought about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That gown will frame your unfolding bravery to
perfection,&rdquo; he murmured in her ear, &ldquo;yet not a quarter so well as
you display yourself, for night-blooming dara lilies would weep
with envy to see you stroll beside the moonlit water, as I would
do, and make myself a bard to sing your praises by this very
moon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She blinked at him, working that out. Luca seemed to
believe she was fluttering her lashes; she accidentally hit him in
the ribs with her elbow before he could nibble her ear. At least
that seemed to be his intention, even if he was coughing now and
claiming he had swallowed a cake crumb the wrong way. The man was
certainly handsome&mdash;<em>Stop that!</em>&mdash;and he did
have a shapely calf&mdash;<em>What are you doing, looking at his
legs?</em>&mdash;but he must think her a brainless ninny. It was
all in aid of his bloody show.</p>

<p>She moved her stool again while he was trying to get
his breath back; she could not move it far without making it clear
that she was running from him, though she held her fork ready in
case he followed again. Thom studied his plate as though more than
a smear remained on the white glaze. Juilin whistled tunelessly and
nearly silently, peering into the dying fire with false intensity.
Elayne looked at her and shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was so pleasant of you to join us,&rdquo; Nynaeve said,
and stood up. Luca stood when she did, a hopeful look in his eye
along with the shine of the firelight. She set her plate atop the
one in his hand. &ldquo;Thom and Juilin will be grateful for your help
with the dishes, I am sure.&rdquo; Before his mouth finished falling
open, she turned to Elayne. &ldquo;It is late, and I expect we&rsquo;ll be
moving across the river early.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Elayne murmured, with just the hint of a
smile. And she put her plate atop Nynaeve&rsquo;s before following her
into the wagon. Nynaeve wanted to hug her. Until she said, &ldquo;Really,
you should not encourage him.&rdquo; Lamps mounted in wall brackets
sprang alight.</p>

<p>Nynaeve planted her fists on her hips.
&ldquo;<em>Encourage</em> him! The only way I could encourage him less
would be to stab him!&rdquo; Sniffing for emphasis, she frowned at the
lamps. &ldquo;Next time, use one of Aludra&rsquo;s firesticks. Strikers. You
are going to forget one day and channel where you shouldn&rsquo;t, and
then where will we be? Running for our lives with a hundred
Whitecloaks after us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stubborn to a fault, the other woman refused to be
diverted. &ldquo;I may be younger than you, but sometimes I think I know
more of men than you ever will. For a man like Valan Luca, that coy
little flight of yours tonight was only asking him to keep pursuing
you. If you would snap his nose off the way you did the first day,
he might give up. You don&rsquo;t tell him to stop, you do not even ask!
You kept smiling at him, Nynaeve. What is the man supposed to
think? You haven&rsquo;t smiled at <em>any</em>one in days!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am trying to hold my temper,&rdquo; Nynaeve muttered.
Everybody complained about her temper, and now that she was trying
to control it, Elayne complained about that! It was not that she
was fool enough to be taken in by his compliments. She certainly
was not so big a fool as that. Elayne laughed at her, and she
scowled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nynaeve. &lsquo;You cannot hold the sun down at dawn.&rsquo;
Lini could have been thinking of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With an effort Nynaeve smoothed her face. She could
too hold her temper. <em>Didn&rsquo;t I just prove it out there?</em> She
held out her hand. &ldquo;Let me have the ring. He will want to cross the
river early tomorrow, and I want at least some real sleep after I&rsquo;m
done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I would go tonight.&rdquo; Concern touched
Elayne&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Nynaeve, you&rsquo;ve been entering <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> practically every night except the meetings
with Egwene. That Bair intends to pick a bone with you, by the way.
I had to tell them why you weren&rsquo;t there yet again, and she says
you should not need rest however often you enter, unless you are
doing something wrong.&rdquo; Concern became firmness, and the younger
woman planted her fists on her hips. &ldquo;I had to listen to a lecture
that was meant for you, and it was not pleasant, with Egwene
standing there nodding her head to every word. Now; I really think
that tonight I should&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Elayne.&rdquo; Nynaeve did not lower her
outstretched hand. &ldquo;I have questions for Birgitte, and her answers
might make me think of more.&rdquo; She did have, sort of; she could
always think of questions for Birgitte. It had nothing to do with
avoiding Egwene, and the Wise Ones. If she visited <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> so often that Elayne always went to the
meetings with Egwene, that was simply how it fell out.</p>

<p>Elayne sighed, but fished the twisted stone ring from
the neck of her dress. &ldquo;Ask her again, Nynaeve. It is very
difficult facing Egwene. She <em>saw</em> Birgitte. She doesn&rsquo;t say
anything, but she looks at me. It is worse when we meet again after
the Wise Ones have gone. She <em>could</em> ask then, and she still
doesn&rsquo;t, and that makes it far worse.&rdquo; She frowned as Nynaeve
transferred the small <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> to the leather cord
around her own neck, with Lan&rsquo;s heavy ring and her Great Serpent.
&ldquo;Why do you suppose none of the Wise Ones ever come with her then?
We don&rsquo;t learn very much in Elaida&rsquo;s study, but you would think
they would at least want to <em>see</em> the Tower. Egwene doesn&rsquo;t
even want to talk about it in front of them. If I seem to come
close, she gives me such a look that you&rsquo;d think she meant to hit
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think they want to avoid the Tower as much as
possible.&rdquo; And wise they were indeed for that. If not for Healing,
she would avoid it, and Aes Sedai, too. She was <em>not</em>
becoming Aes Sedai; she was just hoping to learn more of Healing.
And to help Rand, certainly. &ldquo;They are free women, Elayne. Even if
the Tower was not in the mess it is, would they really want Aes
Sedai traipsing through the Waste, scooping them up to carry back
to Tar Valon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose that is it.&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s tone said she could
not understand it, though. <em>She</em> thought the Tower
wonderful, and could not see why any woman would want to evade Aes
Sedai. Sealed to the White Tower forever, they said when they put
that ring on your finger. And they meant it. Yet the fool girl did
not see it as onerous at all.</p>

<p>Elayne helped her undress, and she stretched out on
her narrow bed in her shift, yawning. It had been a long day, and
it was surprising how tiring standing still could be when someone
unseen was hurling knives at you. Idle thoughts drifted through her
head as she closed her eyes. Elayne had claimed she was practicing
when she had acted the fool with Thom. Not that the
fond-father-and-favorite-daughter they tried on now was much less
foolish to watch. Maybe she could practice herself, just a bit,
with Valan. Now, that <em>was</em> foolish. Men&rsquo;s eyes might wander&mdash;Lan&rsquo;s had <em>better</em> not!&mdash;but she knew how to be
constant. She was simply not going to wear that dress. Far too much
bosom.</p>

<p>Vaguely, she heard Elayne say, &ldquo;Remember to ask her
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sleep took her.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">She stood outside the wagon, in the night. The moon
was high, and drifting clouds cast shadows over the camp. Crickets
chirruped, and the night-birds called. The lions&rsquo; eyes shone as
they watched her from their cages. The white-faced bears were dark
sleeping mounds behind the iron bars. The long picket line stood
empty of horses, Clarine&rsquo;s dogs were not on their leashes beneath
her and Petra&rsquo;s wagon, and the space where the <em>s&rsquo;redit</em>
stood in the waking world was bare. She had come to understand that
only wild creatures had reflections here, but whatever the Seanchan
woman claimed, it was hard to think that those huge gray animals
had been domesticated so long that they were no longer wild.</p>

<p>Abruptly she realized that she was wearing the dress.
Blazing red, far too snug around the hips for decency, and a square
neck cut so low she thought she might pop out. She could not
imagine any woman but Berelain donning it. For Lan, she might. If
they were alone. She <em>had</em> been thinking of Lan when she
drifted off. <em>I was, wasn&rsquo;t I?</em></p>

<p>In any case, she was not about to let Birgitte see
her in the thing. The woman claimed to be a soldier, and the more
time Nynaeve spent with her, the more she realized that some of her
attitudes and comments were as bad as any man&rsquo;s. Worse. A
combination of Berelain and a tavern brawler. The comments did not
come out all the time, but they certainly did whenever Nynaeve
allowed idle thoughts to put her in anything like this dress. She
changed to good stout Two Rivers wool, dark, with a plain shawl she
did not need, her hair decently braided again, and opened her mouth
to call Birgitte.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you change?&rdquo; the woman said, stepping out
from the shadows to lean on her silver bow. Her intricate golden
braid hung over her shoulder, and moonlight shone on her bow and
arrows. &ldquo;I remember wearing a gown that could have been twin to
that, once. It was only to attract attention so Gaidal could sneak
by&mdash;the guards&rsquo; eyes bulged like frogs&rsquo;&mdash;but it was
fun. Especially when I wore it dancing with him later. He <em>
always</em> hates dancing, but he was so intent on keeping any
other man from getting close that he danced every dance.&rdquo; Birgitte
laughed fondly. &ldquo;I won fifty gold solids from him that night at
spin, because he stared so much, he never looked at his tiles. Men
are peculiar. It was not as if he had never seen me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may be,&rdquo; Nynaeve cut in primly, wrapping
the shawl firmly around her shoulders.</p>

<p>Before she could add her question, Birgitte said, &ldquo;I
have found her,&rdquo; and all thought of the question fled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where? Did she see you? Can you take me to her?
Without her seeing?&rdquo; Fear fluttered in Nynaeve&rsquo;s belly&mdash;a fat
lot Valan Luca would say about her courage if he could see her now&mdash;but she was sure it would turn to anger as soon as she saw
Moghedien. &ldquo;If you can bring me close&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She trailed off as
Birgitte raised a hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot think she saw me, or I doubt I would be
here now.&rdquo; She was all seriousness now; Nynaeve found it much
easier to be around her when she showed this side of being a
soldier. &ldquo;I can take you close for a moment, if you want to go, but
she is not alone. At least&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You will see. You must be silent,
and you must take no action against Moghedien. There are other
Forsaken. Perhaps you could destroy her, but can you destroy five
of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fluttering in Nynaeve&rsquo;s middle spread to her
chest. And her knees. Five. She should ask what Birgitte had seen
or heard and let it go at that. Then she could return to her bed
and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;But Birgitte was looking at her. Not questioning her
courage, only looking. Ready to do this thing if she said. &ldquo;I will
be silent. And I won&rsquo;t even think of channeling.&rdquo; Not with five
Forsaken together. Not that she could have channeled a spark at
that moment. She stiffened her knees to keep them from knocking.
&ldquo;Whenever you are ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Birgitte hefted her bow and put a hand on Nynaeve&rsquo;s
arm&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and Nynaeve&rsquo;s breath caught in her throat. They
were standing on nothing, infinite blackness all around, no way to
tell up from down, and in every direction a fall that would last
forever. Head spinning, she made herself look where Birgitte
pointed.</p>

<p>Below them, Moghedien also stood on darkness, garbed
nearly as black as what surrounded her, bent and listening
intently. And as far below her, four huge, high-backed chairs, each
different, sat on an expanse of glistening white-tiled floor
floating in the blackness. Strangely, Nynaeve could hear what those
in the chairs said as well as if she had been among them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;never been a coward,&rdquo; a plumply pretty,
sun-haired woman was saying, &ldquo;so why begin?&rdquo; Seemingly attired in
silvery-gray mist and sparkling gems, she lounged in a chair of
ivory worked so it appeared made of naked acrobats. Four carved men
held it aloft, and her arms rested along the backs of kneeling
women; two men and two women held a white silk cushion behind her
head, while above more were contorted into shapes Nynaeve did not
believe a human body could attain. She blushed when she realized
that some were performing more than acrobatic tricks.</p>

<p>A compact man of middling height, with a livid scar
across his face and a square golden beard, leaned forward angrily.
His chair was heavy wood, carved with columns of armored men and
horses, a steel-gauntleted fist clasping lighting at the back&rsquo;s
peak. His red coat made up for the lack of gilding on the chair,
for golden scrollwork rolled across his shoulders and down his
arms. &ldquo;No one names me coward,&rdquo; he said harshly. &ldquo;But if we
continue as we are, he will come straight for my throat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That has been the plan from the beginning,&rdquo; said a
woman&rsquo;s melodious voice. Nynaeve could not see the speaker, hidden
behind the towering back of a chair that seemed all snow-white
stone and silver.</p>

<p>The second man was large and darkly handsome, with
white wings streaking his temples. He toyed with an ornate golden
goblet, leaning back in a throne. That was the only possible word
for the gem-encrusted thing. A mere hint of gold showed here and
there, but Nynaeve would not have doubted that it was solid gold
beneath all those glittering rubies and emeralds and moonstones; it
had an air of weight quite apart from its massive size. &ldquo;He will
concentrate on you,&rdquo; the big man said in a deep voice. &ldquo;If need be,
one close to him will die, plainly at your order. He will come for
you. And while he is fixed on you alone, the three of us, linked,
will take him. What has changed to alter any of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing has changed,&rdquo; the scarred man growled.
&ldquo;Least of all, my trust for you. I <em>will</em> be part of the
link, or it ends now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The golden-haired woman threw back her head and
laughed. &ldquo;Poor man,&rdquo; she said mockingly, waving a beringed hand at
him. &ldquo;Do you think he would not <em>notice</em> that you were
linked? He has a teacher, remember. A poor one, but not a complete
fool. Next you will ask to include enough of those Black Ajah
children to take the circle beyond thirteen, so you or Rahvin must
have control.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Rahvin trusts us enough to link when he must
allow one of us to guide,&rdquo; the melodious voice said, &ldquo;you can
display an equal trust.&rdquo; The big man looked into his goblet, and
the mist-clad woman smiled faintly. &ldquo;If you cannot trust us not to
turn on you,&rdquo; the unseen woman continued, &ldquo;then trust that we will
be watching each other too closely to turn. You <em>agreed</em> to
all of this, Sammael. Why do you begin to quibble now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave a start as Birgitte touched her arm&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and they were back among the wagons, with the
moon shining through the clouds. It seemed almost normal compared
to where they had been.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; Nynaeve began, and had to swallow. &ldquo;Why
did you bring us away?&rdquo; Her heart leaped into her throat. &ldquo;Did
Moghedien see us?&rdquo; She had been so intent on the other Forsaken&mdash;on the mingled strangeness and commonplaceness of them&mdash;that she had forgotten to keep an eye on Moghedien. She
heaved a fervent sigh when Birgitte shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never took my gaze from her for more than a
moment, and she never moved a muscle. But I do not like being so
exposed. If she <em>had</em> looked up, or one of the others&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve wrapped her shawl tightly around her
shoulders and still shivered. &ldquo;Rahvin and Sammael.&rdquo; She wished she
did not sound hoarse. &ldquo;Did you recognize the others?&rdquo; Of course
Birgitte had; it was a foolish way to phrase it, but she was
shaken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lanfear was the one hidden by her chair. The other
was Graendal. Do not think her a fool because she was in a chair
that would make a Senje no-room keeper blush. She is devious, and
she uses her pets in rites to cause the roughest soldier I ever
knew to swear celibacy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Graendal is devious,&rdquo; Moghedien&rsquo;s voice said, &ldquo;but
not devious enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Birgitte whirled, silver bow coming up, silver arrow
almost flying to nock&mdash;and abruptly hurtled thirty paces
through the moonlight to crash against Nynaeve&rsquo;s wagon so hard that
she bounced back five and lay in a crumpled heap.</p>

<p>Desperately Nynaeve reached for <em>saidar</em>. Fear
streaked through her anger, but there was anger enough&mdash;and
it ran into an invisible wall between her and the warm glow of the
True Source. She almost howled. Something seized her feet, jerking
them backward and up off the ground; her hands flew up and back
until wrists met ankles above her head. Her clothes became powder
that slid from her skin, and her braid dragged her head back until
the braid rested on her bottom. Frantic, she tried to step out of
the dream. Nothing happened. She hung doubled in midair like some
netted creature, every muscle strained to its limit. Tremors ran
through her; her fingers twitched feebly, brushing her feet. She
thought if she tried to move anything else, her back would
break.</p>

<p>Strangely, her fear was gone, now that it was too
late. She was certain that she could have been quick enough, if not
for the terror that had laced through her when she needed to act.
All she wanted was a chance to put her hands around Moghedien&rsquo;s
throat. <em>Much good that does now!</em> Every breath came in
strained panting.</p>

<p>Moghedien moved to where Nynaeve could see her,
between the quivering triangle of her arms. The glow of <em>
saidar</em> surrounded the woman mockingly. &ldquo;A detail from
Graendal&rsquo;s chair,&rdquo; the Forsaken said. Her dress was mist like
Graendal&rsquo;s, sliding from black fog to nearly transparent and back
to gleaming silver. The fabric changed almost constantly. Nynaeve
had seen her wear it before, in Tanchico. &ldquo;Not something I would
have thought of on my own, but Graendal can be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;edifying.&rdquo;
Nynaeve glared at her, but Moghedien did not appear to notice. &ldquo;I
can hardly believe that <em>you</em> actually came hunting <em>
me</em>. Did you really believe that because once you were lucky
enough to catch me off guard, you might be my equal?&rdquo; The woman&rsquo;s
laugh was cutting. &ldquo;If you only knew the effort I have put into
finding you. And you came to me.&rdquo; She glanced around at the wagons,
studying the lions and bears for a moment before turning back to
Nynaeve. &ldquo;A menagerie? That would make you easy enough to find. If
I needed to, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do your worst, burn you,&rdquo; Nynaeve snarled. As best
she could. Doubled up as she was, she had to force the words out
one by one. She did not dare look straight toward Birgitte&mdash;not that she could have shifted her head enough to&mdash;but
rolling her eyes as if caught between fury and fear, she caught a
glimpse. Her stomach went hollow, even stretched tight as a
sheepskin for drying. Birgitte lay sprawled on the ground, silver
arrows spilling from the quiver at her waist, her silver bow a span
from her unmoving hand. &ldquo;Lucky, you say? If you hadn&rsquo;t managed to
sneak up on me, I&rsquo;d have striped you till you wailed. I&rsquo;d have
wrung your neck like a chicken.&rdquo; She had only one chance, if
Birgitte was dead, and a bleak one. To make Moghedien so angry that
she killed her quickly in a rage. If only there was some way to
warn Elayne. Her dying would have to do it. &ldquo;Remember how you said
you&rsquo;d use me for a mounting block? And later, when I said I&rsquo;d do
the same for you? That was after I had beaten you. When you were
whimpering and pleading for your life. Offering me anything. You
are a gutless coward! The leavings from a nightjar! You piece of&mdash;!&rdquo; Something thick crawled into her mouth, flattening her
tongue and forcing her jaws wide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are so simple,&rdquo; Moghedien murmured. &ldquo;Believe me,
I am quite angry enough with you already. I do not think I <em>
will</em> use you for a mounting block.&rdquo; Her smile made Nynaeve&rsquo;s
skin crawl. &ldquo;I think I will turn you into a horse. It is quite
possible, here. A horse, a mouse, a frog&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She paused,
listening. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a cricket. And every time you come to <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, you&rsquo;ll be a horse, until I change it. Or some
other with the knowledge does so.&rdquo; She paused again, looking almost
sympathetic. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;d not want to give you false hope. There are
only nine of us now who know that binding, and you would not want
any of the others to have you any more than myself. You will be a
horse every time I bring you here. You will have your own saddle
and bridle. I will even braid your mane.&rdquo; Nynaeve&rsquo;s braid jerked
almost out of her scalp. &ldquo;You will remember who you are even then,
of course. I think I will enjoy our rides, though you may not.&rdquo;
Moghedien took a deep breath, and her dress darkened to something
that glistened in the pale light; Nynaeve could not be sure, but
she thought it might be the color of wet blood. &ldquo;You make me
approach Semirhage. It will be well to be done with you, so I can
turn my full attention to matters of importance. Is the little
yellow-haired chit with you in this menagerie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The thickness vanished from Nynaeve&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;I am
alone, you stupid&mdash;&rdquo; Pain. As if she had been beaten from
ankles to shoulders, every stroke landing at once. She bellowed
shrilly. Again. She tried to clamp her teeth shut, but her own
endless shriek filled her ears. Tears rolled shamingly down her
cheeks as she sobbed, waiting hopelessly for the next.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she with you?&rdquo; Moghedien said patiently. &ldquo;Do not
waste time trying to make me kill you. I won&rsquo;t. You will live many
years serving me. Your rather pitiful abilities might be of some
use once I train them. Once I train you. But I can make you think
that what you just felt was a lover&rsquo;s caress. Now, answer my
question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve managed to gather breath. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she wept.
&ldquo;She ran off with a man after we left Tanchico. A man old enough to
be her grandfather, but he had money. We heard what happened in the
Tower&rdquo;&mdash;she was sure Moghedien must know of that&mdash;&ldquo;and she was
afraid to go back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other woman laughed. &ldquo;A delightful tale. I can
almost see what fascinates Semirhage about breaking the spirit. Oh,
you are going to provide me with a great deal of entertainment,
Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara. But first, you are going to bring the girl Elayne
to me. You will shield her and bind her and bring her to lie at my
feet. Do you know why? Because some things are actually stronger in
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> than in the waking world. That is why you
will be a glossy white mare whenever I bring you here. And it is
not only hurts taken here that last into waking. Compulsion is
another. I want you to think of it for a moment or two, before you
begin believing it your own idea. I suspect that the girl is your
friend. But you are going to bring her to me like a pet&mdash;&rdquo;
Moghedien screamed as a silver arrow suddenly stuck its head out
from below her right breast.</p>

<p>Nynaeve fell to the ground like a dropped sack. The
fall knocked every speck of breath from her lungs as surely as a
hammer in the belly. Straining to breathe, she struggled to make
racked muscles move, to fight through pain to <em>saidar</em>.</p>

<p>Staggering on her feet, Birgitte fumbled another
arrow from her quiver. &ldquo;Go, Nynaeve!&rdquo; It was a mumbling shout. &ldquo;Get
away!&rdquo; Birgitte&rsquo;s head wavered, and the silver bow wobbled as she
raised it.</p>

<p>The glow around Moghedien increased until it seemed
as if the blinding sun surrounded her.</p>

<p>The night folded in over Birgitte like an ocean wave,
enveloping her in blackness. When it passed, the bow dropped atop
empty clothes as they collapsed. The clothes faded like fog burning
off, and only the bow and arrows remained, shining in the
moonlight.</p>

<p>Moghedien sank to her knees, panting, clutching the
protruding arrow shaft with both hands as the glow around her faded
and died. Then she vanished, and the silver arrow fell where she
had been, stained dark with blood.</p>

<p>After what seemed an eternity, Nynaeve managed to
push up to hands and knees. Weeping, she crawled to Birgitte&rsquo;s bow.
This time it was not pain that made tears come. Kneeling, naked and
not caring, she clutched the bow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;Oh,
Birgitte, forgive me. Birgitte!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no answer except the mournful cry of a
night-bird.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Liandrin leaped to her feet as the door to
Moghedien&rsquo;s bedchamber crashed open and the Chosen staggered into
the sitting room, blood soaking her silk shift. Chesmal and Temaile
rushed to her side, each taking an arm to keep the woman on her
feet, but Liandrin remained by her chair. The others were out;
perhaps out of Amador, for all Liandrin knew. Moghedien told only
what she wanted the hearer to know, and punished questions she did
not like.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Temaile gasped.</p>

<p>Moghedien&rsquo;s brief look should have fried her where
she stood. &ldquo;You have some small ability with Healing,&rdquo; the Chosen
told Chesmal thickly. Blood stained her lips, trickled from the
corner of her mouth in an increasing stream. &ldquo;Do it. Now,
fool!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dark-haired Ghealdanin woman did not hesitate in
laying hands to Moghedien&rsquo;s head. Liandrin sneered to herself, as
the glow surrounded Chesmal; concern painted Chesmal&rsquo;s handsome
face, and Temaile&rsquo;s delicate, foxlike features were contorted with
pure fright and worry. So faithful, they were. Such obedient
lapdogs. Moghedien lifted up onto her toes, head flung back; eyes
wide, she shook, breath rushing from her gaping mouth as if she had
been plunged into ice.</p>

<p>In moments it was done. The glow around Chesmal
disappeared, and Moghedien&rsquo;s heels settled to the blue-and-green
patterned carpet. Without Temaile&rsquo;s support, she might have fallen.
Only a part of the strength for Healing came from the Power, the
rest came from the person being Healed. Whatever wound had caused
all that bleeding would be gone, but Moghedien was surely as weak
as if she had lain in bed an invalid for weeks. She pulled the fine
gold-and-ivory silk scarf from Temaile&rsquo;s belt to wipe her mouth as
the woman helped her turn toward the bedchamber door. Weak, and her
back turned.</p>

<p>Liandrin struck as hard as she ever had, with
everything she had puzzled out of what the woman had done to
her.</p>

<p>Even as she did, <em>saidar</em> seemed to fill
Moghedien like a flood. Liandrin&rsquo;s probe died as the Source was
shielded from her. Flows of Air picked her up and slammed her
against the paneled wall hard enough to make her teeth rattle.
Spread-eagled, helpless, she hung there.</p>

<p>Chesmal and Temaile exchanged confused glances, as if
they did not understand what had occurred. They continued to
support Moghedien as she came to stand in front of Liandrin, still
calmly wiping her mouth on Temaile&rsquo;s scarf. Moghedien channeled,
and the blood on her shift turned black and flaked away, falling to
the carpet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-you do not understand, Great M-mistress,&rdquo; Liandrin
said frantically. &ldquo;I only wished to help you to have the good
sleep.&rdquo; For once in her life, slipping back into the accents of a
commoner did not concern her in the least. &ldquo;I only&mdash;&rdquo; She cut
off with a strangled gagging as a flow of Air seized her tongue,
stretching it out between her teeth. Her brown eyes bulged. A hair
more pressure, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I pull it out?&rdquo; Moghedien studied her face,
but spoke as if to herself. &ldquo;I think not. A pity for you that the
al&rsquo;Meara woman makes me think like Semirhage. Otherwise, I might
only kill you.&rdquo; Suddenly she was tying off the shield, the knot
growing ever more intricate, until Liandrin lost the twists and
turns completely. And still it went on. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; Moghedien said
finally in tones of satisfaction. &ldquo;You will search a very long
time to find anyone who can unravel that. But you will have no
opportunity to search.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liandrin searched Chesmal&rsquo;s face, and Temaile&rsquo;s, for
some sign of sympathy, pity, anything. Chesmal&rsquo;s eyes were cold and
stern; Temaile&rsquo;s shone, and she touched her lips with the tip of
her tongue and smiled. Not a friendly smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You thought you had learned something of
compulsion,&rdquo; Moghedien went on. &ldquo;I will teach you a bit more.&rdquo; For
an instant Liandrin shivered, Moghedien&rsquo;s eyes filling her vision
as the woman&rsquo;s voice filled her ears, her entire head. &ldquo;Live.&rdquo; The
instant passed, and sweat beaded on Liandrin&rsquo;s face as the Chosen
smiled at her. &ldquo;Compulsion has many limits, but a command to do
what someone wants to do in their inmost depths will hold for a
lifetime. You will live, however much you think you want to take
your life. And you will think of it. You will lie weeping many
nights, wishing for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The flow holding Liandrin&rsquo;s tongue vanished, and she
barely paused to swallow. &ldquo;Please, Great Mistress, I swear I did
not mean&mdash;&rdquo; Her head rang and silvery black spots danced
before her eyes from Moghedien&rsquo;s slap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;attractions&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to doing a thing
physically,&rdquo; the woman breathed. &ldquo;Do you wish to beg more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Great Mistress&mdash;&rdquo; The second slap sent
her hair flying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please&mdash;&rdquo; A third nearly unhinged her jaw. Her
cheek burned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you cannot be more inventive than that, I will
not listen. You will listen instead. I think what I have planned
for you would delight Semirhage herself.&rdquo; Moghedien&rsquo;s smile was
almost as dark as Temaile&rsquo;s. &ldquo;You will live, not stilled, but
knowing that you could channel again, if only you found someone to
untie your shield. Yet that is only the beginning. Evon will be
glad of a new scullery girl, and I am sure the Arene woman will
want to have long talks with you about her husband. Why, they will
enjoy your company so much that I doubt you will see the outside of
this house during the years to come. Long years in which to wish
that you had served me faithfully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liandrin shook her head, mouthing &ldquo;no&rdquo; and &ldquo;please&rdquo;;
she was crying too hard to force the words out.</p>

<p>Turning her head to Temaile, Moghedien said, &ldquo;Prepare
her for them. And tell them they are not to kill or maim her. I
want her always to believe she <em>might</em> escape. Even futile
hope will keep her alive to suffer.&rdquo; She turned away on Chesmal&rsquo;s
arm, and the flows holding Liandrin to the wall vanished.</p>

<p>Her legs gave way like straw, crumpling her to the
carpet. Only the shield remained; she hammered at it futilely as
she crawled after Moghedien, trying to catch the hem of her shift,
sobbing brokenly. &ldquo;Please, Great Mistress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are with a menagerie,&rdquo; Moghedien told Chesmal.
&ldquo;All of your searching, and I had to find them myself. A menagerie
should not be too difficult to locate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will serve faithfully,&rdquo; Liandrin wept. Fear turned
her limbs to water, she could not crawl fast enough to catch up.
They did not even look back at her, scrabbling across the carpet
after them. &ldquo;Bind me, Great Mistress. Anything. I will be the
faithful dog!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are many menageries traveling north,&rdquo; Chesmal
said, eagerness to negate her failure filling her voice. &ldquo;To
Ghealdan, Great Mistress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I must to Ghealdan,&rdquo; Moghedien said. &ldquo;You will
procure fast horses and follow&mdash;&rdquo; The bedchamber door closed
on her words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be the faithful dog,&rdquo; Liandrin sobbed in a
heap on the carpet. Lifting her head, she blinked tears away to see
Temaile watching her, rubbing her arms and smiling. &ldquo;We could
overwhelm her, Temaile. We three together could&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We <em>three</em>?&rdquo; Temaile laughed. &ldquo;You could not
overwhelm fat Evon.&rdquo; Her eyes narrowed as she studied the shield
fastened to Liandrin. &ldquo;You might as well be stilled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen. Please.&rdquo; Liandrin swallowed hard, trying to
clear her voice, but it was still thick, if burning with urgency,
when she went on at frantic speed. &ldquo;We have spoken of the
dissension that must rule among the Chosen. If Moghedien hides
herself so, she must hide from the other Chosen. If we take her and
give her to them, think of the places we could have. We could be
exalted above kings and queens. We could be Chosen ourselves!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment&mdash;one blessed, wonderful moment&mdash;the child-faced woman hesitated. Then she shook her head.
&ldquo;You have never known how high to lift your eyes. &lsquo;Who reaches for
the sun will be burned.&rsquo; No, I think that I will not be burned for
reaching too high. I think that I will do as I am told, and soften
you for Evon.&rdquo; Suddenly she smiled, showing teeth that made her
even more vulpine. &ldquo;How surprised he will be when you crawl to kiss
his feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liandrin started screaming before Temaile even
began.</p>
