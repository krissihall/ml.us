<h4><em>Figs and Mice</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>layne
realized that she was being carried upstairs
by her shoulders and ankles. Her eyes opened, she could see, but
the rest of her body might as well have belonged to someone else
for all the control she had over it. Even blinking was slow. Her
brain felt crammed full of feathers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s awake, Mistress!&rdquo; Luci shrilled, nearly
dropping her feet. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s looking at me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you not to worry.&rdquo; Mistress Macura&rsquo;s voice
came from above her head. &ldquo;She cannot channel, or twitch a muscle,
not with forkroot tea in her. I discovered that by accident, but it
has certainly come in handy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was true. Elayne sagged between them like a doll
with half the stuffing gone, bumping her bottom along the steps,
and she could as well have run as channel. She could sense the True
Source, but trying to embrace it was like trying to pick up a
needle on a mirror with cold-numbed fingers. Panic welled up, and a
tear slid down her cheek.</p>

<p>Perhaps these women meant to turn her over to the
Whitecloaks for execution, but she could not make herself believe
that the Whitecloaks had women setting traps in the hope that an
Aes Sedai might wander in. That left Darkfriends, and almost
certainly serving the Black Ajah right along with the Yellow. She
would surely be put in the hands of the Black Ajah unless Nynaeve
had escaped. But if she was to escape, she could not count on
anyone else. And she could neither move nor channel. Suddenly she
realized that she was trying to scream, and producing only a thin,
gurgling mew! Halting it took all the strength she had left.</p>

<p>Nynaeve knew all about herbs, or claimed she did; why
had she not recognized whatever that tea was? <em>Stop this
whining!</em> The small, firm voice in the back of her head sounded
remarkably like Lini. <em>A shoat squealing under a fence just
attracts the fox, when it should be trying to run</em>.
Desperately, she set herself to the simple task of embracing
<em>saidar</em>. It had been a simple task, but now she might as
well have been attempting to reach <em>saidin</em>. She kept on,
though; it was the only thing she could do.</p>

<p>Mistress Macura, at least, seemed to have no worry.
As soon as they had dropped Elayne onto a narrow bed in a small,
close room with one window, she hustled Luci right out again with
not even a backward glance. Elayne&rsquo;s head had fallen so she could
see another cramped bed, and a highchest with tarnished brass pulls
on the drawers. She could move her eyes, but shifting her head was
beyond her.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the two women returned, puffing,
with Nynaeve slung between them, and heaved her onto the other bed.
Her face was slack, and glistening with tears, but her dark eyes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Fury filled them, and fear, too. Elayne hoped anger was
uppermost; Nynaeve was stronger than she, when she <em>could</em>
channel; perhaps Nynaeve could manage where she was failing
miserably, time after time. Those had to be tears of rage.</p>

<p>Telling the thin girl to stay there, Mistress Macura
hurried out once more, this time coming back with a tray that she
placed atop the highchest. It held the yellow teapot, one cup, a
funnel and a tall hourglass. &ldquo;Now Luci, mind you pour a good two
ounces into each of them as soon as that hourglass empties. As
soon, mind!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we give it to them now, Mistress?&rdquo; the
girl moaned, wringing her hands. &ldquo;I want them to go back to sleep.
I don&rsquo;t like them looking at me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They would sleep like the dead, girl, and this way
we can let them rouse just enough to walk when we need them to. I
will dose them more properly when it&rsquo;s time to send them off.
They&rsquo;ll have headaches and stomach cramps to pay for it, but no
more than they deserve, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what if they <em>can</em> channel, Mistress?
What if they do? They&rsquo;re looking at me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop blathering, girl,&rdquo; the older woman said
briskly. &ldquo;If they could, don&rsquo;t you think they would have by now?
They are helpless as kittens in a sack. And they will stay that way
as long you keep a good dose in them. Now, you do as I told you,
understand? I must go tell old Avi to send off one of his pigeons,
and make a few arrangements, but I will be back as soon as I can.
You had better brew another pot of forkroot just in case. I&rsquo;ll go
out the back. Close up the shop. Someone might wander in, and that
would never do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After Mistress Macura left, Luci stood staring at
them for a while, still wringing her hands, then finally scurried
out herself. Her sniffling faded down the stairs.</p>

<p>Elayne could see sweat beading on Nynaeve&rsquo;s brow; she
hoped it was effort, not the heat. <em>Try, Nynaeve</em>. She
herself reached for the True Source, fumbling clumsily through the
wads of wool that seemed to pack her head, failed, tried again and
failed, tried again&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Oh, Light, try Nynaeve! Try!</em></p>

<p>The hourglass filled her eyes; she could not look at
anything else. Sand pouring down, each grain marking another
failure on her part. The last grain dropped. And Luci did not
come.</p>

<p>Elayne strained harder, for the Source, to move.
After a bit the fingers of her left hand twitched. Yes! A few
minutes more, and she could lift her hand; only a feeble inch
before it fell again, but it had lifted. With an effort, she could
turn her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fight it,&rdquo; Nynaeve mumbled thickly, barely
intelligible. Her hands were gripping the coverlet under her
tightly; she seemed to be trying to sit up. Not even her head
lifted, but she was trying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Elayne tried to say; it sounded more like a
grunt to her ears.</p>

<p>Slowly she managed to raise her hand to where she
could see it, and hold it there. A thrill of triumph shot through
her. <em>Stay afraid of us, Luci. Stay down there in the kitchen a
little while longer, and</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The door banged open, and sobs of frustration racked
her as Luci dashed in. She had been so close. The girl took one
look at them and with a yelp of pure terror darted for the
highchest.</p>

<p>Elayne tried to fight her, but thin as she was, Luci
batted her floundering hands away effortlessly, forced the funnel
between her teeth just as easily. The girl panted as if running.
Cold, bitter tea filled Elayne&rsquo;s mouth. She stared up at the girl
in a panic that Luci&rsquo;s face shared. But Luci held Elayne&rsquo;s mouth
shut and stroked her throat with a grim if fearful determination
until she swallowed. As darkness overwhelmed Elayne, she could hear
liquid sounds of protest coming from Nynaeve.</p>

<p>When her eyes opened again, Luci was gone, and the
sands trickled through the glass again. Nynaeve&rsquo;s dark eyes were
bulging, whether in fear or anger, Elayne could not have said. No,
Nynaeve would not give in. That was one of the things she admired
in the other woman. Nynaeve&rsquo;s head could have been on the chopping
block and she would not give up. <em>Our heads</em> are <em>on the
block!</em></p>

<p>It made her ashamed that she was so much weaker than
Nynaeve. She was supposed to be Queen of Andor one day, and she
wanted to howl with terror. She did not, even in her head&mdash;doggedly she went back to trying to force her limbs to move, to
trying to touch <em>saidar</em>&mdash;but she wanted to. How could
she ever be a queen, when she was so weak? Again she reached for
the Source. Again. Again. Racing the grains of sand. Again.</p>

<p>Once more the glass emptied itself without Luci. Ever
so slowly, she reached the point where she could raise her hand
again. And then her head! Even if it did flop back immediately. She
could hear Nynaeve muttering to herself, and she could actually
understand most of the words.</p>

<p>The door crashed open once more. Elayne lifted her
head to stare at it despairingly&mdash;and gaped. Thom Merrilin
stood there like the hero of one of his own tales, one hand firmly
gripping the neck of a Luci near fainting, the other holding a
knife ready to throw. Elayne laughed delightedly, though it came
out more like a croak.</p>

<p>Roughly, he shoved the girl into a corner. &ldquo;You stay
there, or I&rsquo;ll strop this blade on your hide!&rdquo; In two steps he was
at Elayne&rsquo;s side, smoothing her hair back, worry painting his
leathery face. &ldquo;What did you give them, girl? Tell me, or&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not her,&rdquo; Nynaeve muttered. &ldquo;Other one. Went away.
Help me up. Have to walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom left her reluctantly, Elayne thought. He showed
Luci his knife again threateningly&mdash;she cowered as if she
never meant to move again&mdash;then made it disappear up his
sleeve in a twinkling. Hauling Nynaeve to her feet, he began
walking her up and down the few paces the room allowed. She sagged
against him limply, shuffling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear this frightened little cat didn&rsquo;t
trap you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If she had been the one&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He shook his
head. No doubt he would think just as little of them if Nynaeve
told him the truth; Elayne certainly did not intend to. &ldquo;I found
her rushing up the stairs, so panicked she did not even hear me
behind her. I am not so glad that another one got away without
Juilin seeing her. Is she likely to bring others back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne rolled over onto her side. &ldquo;I do not think so,
Thom,&rdquo; she mumbled. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t let&mdash;too many people&mdash;know about herself.&rdquo; In another minute she might be able to sit up.
She was looking right at Luci; the girl flinched and tried to
shrink through the wall. &ldquo;The Whitecloaks&mdash;would take her as&mdash;quickly as they would us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Juilin?&rdquo; Nynaeve said. Her head wavered as she
glared up at the gleeman. She had no trouble speaking, though. &ldquo;I
told the pair of you to stay with the wagon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom blew out his mustaches irritably. &ldquo;You told us
to put up the supplies, which did not take two men. Juilin followed
you, and when none of you came back, I went looking for him.&rdquo; He
snorted again. &ldquo;For all he knew, there were a dozen men in here,
but he was ready to come in after you alone. He is tying Skulker in
the back. A good thing I decided to ride in. I think we&rsquo;ll need the
horse to get you two out of here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne found that she could sit up, barely, pulling
herself hand over hand along the coverlet, but an effort to stand
nearly put her flat again. <em>Saidar</em> was as unobtainable as
ever; her head still felt like a goose-down pillow. Nynaeve was
beginning to hold herself a little straighter, to lift her feet,
but she still hung on Thom.</p>

<p>Minutes later Juilin arrived, pushing Mistress Macura
ahead of him with his belt knife. &ldquo;She came through a gate in the
back fence. Thought I was a thief. It seemed best to bring her on
in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The seamstress face had gone so pale at the sight of
them that her eyes seemed darker, and about to come out of her head
besides. She licked her lips and smoothed her skirt incessantly,
and cast quick little glances at Juilin&rsquo;s knife as if wondering
whether it might not be best to run anyway. For the most part,
though, she stared at Elayne, and Nynaeve; Elayne thought it an
even chance whether she would burst into tears or swoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put her over there,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, nodding to where
Luci still shivered in the corner with her arms wrapped around her
knees, &ldquo;and help Elayne. I never heard of forkroot, but walking
seems to help the effects pass. You can walk most things off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juilin pointed to the corner with his knife, and
Mistress Macura scurried to it and sat herself down beside Luci,
still wetting her lips fearfully. &ldquo;I would not have done&mdash;what I did&mdash;only, I had orders. You must understand that. I
had orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gently helping Elayne to her feet, Juilin supported
her in walking the few steps available, crisscrossing the other
pair. She wished it were Thom. Juilin&rsquo;s arm around her waist was
much too familiar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Orders from whom?&rdquo; Nynaeve barked. &ldquo;Who do you
report to in the Tower?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The seamstress looked sick, but she clamped her mouth
shut determinedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; Nynaeve told her, scowling,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let Juilin have you. He&rsquo;s a Tairen thief-catcher, and he
knows how to bring out a confession as quickly as any Whitecloak
Questioner. Don&rsquo;t you, Juilin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some rope to tie her,&rdquo; he said, grinning a grin so
villainous that Elayne almost tried to step away from him, &ldquo;some
rags to gag her until she is ready to talk, some cooking oil and
salt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His chuckle curdled Elayne&rsquo;s blood. &ldquo;She will talk.&rdquo;
Mistress Macura held herself rigidly against the wall, staring at
him, eyes as wide as they would go. Luci looked at him as if he had
just turned into a Trolloc, eight feet tall and complete with
horns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Nynaeve said after a moment. &ldquo;You should
find everything you need in the kitchen, Juilin.&rdquo; Elayne shifted a
startled look from her to the thief-catcher and back. Surely they
did not really mean to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Not Nynaeve!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Narenwin Barda,&rdquo; the seamstress gasped suddenly.
Words tripped over one another spilling out of her. &ldquo;I send my
reports to Narenwin Barda, at an inn in Tar Valon called The
Upriver Run. Avi Shendar keeps pigeons for me on the edge of town.
He doesn&rsquo;t know who I send messages to or who I get them from, and
he does not care. His wife had the falling sickness, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She
trailed off, shuddering and watching Juilin.</p>

<p>Elayne knew Narenwin, or at least had seen her in the
Tower. A thin little woman you could forget was there, she was so
quiet. And kind, too; one day a week, she let children bring their
pets to the Tower grounds for her to Heal. Hardly the sort of woman
to be Black Ajah. On the other hand, one of the Black Ajah names
they knew was Marillin Gemalphin; she liked cats, and went out of
her way to look after strays.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Narenwin Barda,&rdquo; Nynaeve said grimly. &ldquo;I want more
names, inside the Tower or out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t have any more,&rdquo; Mistress Macura said
faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will see about that. How long have you been a
Darkfriend? How long have you served the Black Ajah?&rdquo;</p>

<p>An indignant squall erupted from Luci. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t
Darkfriends!&rdquo; She glanced at Mistress Macura and sidled away from
her. &ldquo;At least, I&rsquo;m not! I walk in the Light! I do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other woman&rsquo;s reaction was no less strong. If her
eyes had bulged before, they popped now. &ldquo;The Black&mdash;! You
mean it really exists? But the Tower has always denied&mdash;Why,
I asked Narenwin, the day she chose me for the Yellow&rsquo;s
eyes-and-ears, and it was the next morning before I could stop
weeping and crawl out of my bed. I am not&mdash;not!&mdash;a
Darkfriend! <em>Never!</em> I serve the Yellow Ajah! The
<em>Yellow</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still hanging on to Juilin&rsquo;s arm, Elayne exchanged
puzzled looks with Nynaeve. Any Darkfriend would deny it, of
course, but there seemed a ring of truth in the women&rsquo;s voices.
Their outrage at the accusation was nearly enough to overcome their
fear. From the way Nynaeve hesitated, she heard the same thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you serve the Yellow,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;why did
you drug us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was her,&rdquo; the seamstress replied, nodding at
Elayne. &ldquo;I was sent her description a month since, right down to
that way she holds her chin sometimes so she seems to be looking
down at you. Narenwin said she might use the name Elayne, and even
claim to be of a noble House.&rdquo; Word by word, her anger over being
called a Darkfriend seemed to bubble higher. &ldquo;Maybe you are a
Yellow sister, but she&rsquo;s no Aes Sedai, just a runaway Accepted.
Narenwin said I was to report her presence, and that of anyone with
her. And to delay her, if I could. Or even capture her. And anyone
with her. How they expected me to capture an Accepted, I do not
know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think even Narenwin knows about my forkroot
tea!&mdash;but that is what my orders said! They said I should
risk exposure even&mdash;here, where it&rsquo;d be my death!&mdash;if I had
to! You just wait until the Amyrlin puts her hands on you, young
woman! On all of you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Amyrlin!&rdquo; Elayne exclaimed. &ldquo;What does she have
to do with this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was on her orders. By order of the Amyrlin Seat,
it said. It said the Amyrlin herself said I could use any means
short of killing you. You will wish you <em>were</em> dead when the
Amyrlin gets hold of you!&rdquo; Her sharp nod was full of furious
satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember that we are not in anyone&rsquo;s hands yet,&rdquo;
Nynaeve said dryly. &ldquo;You are in ours.&rdquo; Her eyes looked as shocked
as Elayne felt, though. &ldquo;Was any reason given?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reminder that she was the captive sapped the
brief burst of spirit from the woman. She sagged listlessly against
Luci, each keeping the other from falling over. &ldquo;No. Sometimes
Narenwin gives a reason, but not this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you intend to just keep us here, drugged, until
someone came for us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going to send you off by cart, dressed in some
old clothes.&rdquo; Not even a shred of resistance remained in the
woman&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;I sent a pigeon to tell Narenwin you were here, and
what I was doing. Therin Lugay owes me a strong favor, and I meant
to give him enough forkroot to last all the way to Tar Valon, if
Narenwin didn&rsquo;t send sisters to meet you sooner. He thinks you are
ill, and the tea is the only thing keeping you alive until an Aes
Sedai can Heal you. A woman has to be careful, dealing in remedies
in Amadicia. Cure too many, or too well, somebody whispers Aes
Sedai, and the next you know your house is burning down. Or worse.
Therin knows to hold his tongue about what he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve made Thom help her closer, where she could
stare down at the seamstress. &ldquo;And the message? The real message?
You did not put that signal out in the hope of luring us in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave you the real message,&rdquo; the woman said
wearily. &ldquo;I did not think it could do any harm. I don&rsquo;t understand
it, and I&mdash;please&mdash;&rdquo; Suddenly she was sobbing,
clinging to Luci as hard as the younger woman did to her, both of
them wailing and babbling. &ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t let him use the salt on
me! Please! Not the salt! Oh, please!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tie them up,&rdquo; Nynaeve said disgustedly after a
moment, &ldquo;and we will go downstairs where we can talk.&rdquo; Thom helped
her to sit on the edge of the nearest bed, then quickly cut strips
from the other coverlet.</p>

<p>In short order both women were bound, back to back,
the hands of one to the feet of the other, with wadded bits of
coverlet tied in for gags. The pair were still weeping when Thom
assisted Nynaeve from the room.</p>

<p>Elayne wished she could walk as well as the other
woman, but she still needed Juilin&rsquo;s support not to go tumbling
down the stairs. She felt a small stab of jealousy watching Thom
with his arm around Nynaeve. <em>You are a foolish little
girl</em>, Lini&rsquo;s voice said sharply. <em>I am a grown woman</em>,
she told it with a firmness she would not have dared with her old
nurse even today. <em>I do love Rand, but he is far away, and Thom
is sophisticated and intelligent and</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It sounded too much
like excuses, even to her. Lini would have given the snort that
meant she was about to stop tolerating foolishness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Juilin,&rdquo; she asked hesitantly, &ldquo;what were you going
to do with the salt and cooking oil? Not exactly,&rdquo; she added more
quickly. &ldquo;Just a general idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her for a moment. &ldquo;I do not know. But
they did not, either. That is the trick of it; their minds made up
worse than I ever could. I have seen a tough man break when I sent
for a basket of figs and some mice. You have to be careful, though.
Some will confess anything, true or not, just to escape what they
imagine. I do not think those two did, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not either. She could not repress a shiver,
however. <em>What</em> would <em>somebody do with figs and
mice?</em> She hoped she stopped wondering before she gave herself
nightmares.</p>

<p>By the time they reached the kitchen, Nynaeve was
tottering about without help, poking into the cupboard full of
colorful canisters. Elayne needed one of the chairs. The blue
canister sat on the table, and a full green teapot, but she tried
not to look at them. She still could not channel. She could embrace
<em>saidar</em>, yet it slipped away as soon as she did. At least
she was confident now that the Power would return to her. The
alternative was too horrible to contemplate, and she had not let
herself until this moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thom,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, lifting the lids on various
containers and peering in. &ldquo;Juilin.&rdquo; She paused, took a deep
breath, and, still not looking at the two men, said, &ldquo;Thank you. I
begin to see why Aes Sedai have Warders. Thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not all Aes Sedai did. Reds considered all men
tainted because of what men who could channel did, and a few never
bothered because they did not leave the Tower or simply did not
replace a Warder who died. The Greens were the only Ajah to allow
bonding with more than one Warder. Elayne wanted to be a Green. Not
for that reason, of course, but because the Greens called
themselves the Battle Ajah. Where Browns searched for lost
knowledge and Blues involved themselves in causes, Green sisters
held themselves ready for the Last Battle, when they would go
forth, as they had in the Trolloc Wars, to face new Dreadlords.</p>

<p>The two men stared at one another in open amazement.
They had surely been ready for the usual rough side of Nynaeve&rsquo;s
tongue. Elayne was almost as shocked. Nynaeve liked having to be
helped as much as she liked being wrong; either made her as prickly
as a briar, though of course she always claimed to be a picture of
sweet reason and sense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Wisdom.&rdquo; Nynaeve took a pinch of powder from one
of the canisters and sniffed it, touched it to the tip of her
tongue. &ldquo;Or whatever they call it here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have a name for it here,&rdquo; Thom said. &ldquo;Not
many women follow your old craft in Amadicia. Too dangerous. For
most of those it&rsquo;s only a sideline.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pulling a leather scrip from the bottom of the
cupboard, Nynaeve began making up small bundles from some of the
containers. &ldquo;And who do they go to when they&rsquo;re ill? A
hedge-doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Elayne said. It always pleased her to show
Thom that she knew things about the world, too. &ldquo;In Amadicia, it is
men who study herbs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve frowned scornfully. &ldquo;What could a man ever
know about curing anything? I&rsquo;d as soon ask a farmer to make a
dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly Elayne realized that she had been thinking
of anything and everything except what Mistress Macura had said.
<em>Not thinking about a thorn doesn&rsquo;t make it hurt your foot
less</em>. One of Lini&rsquo;s favorites. &ldquo;Nynaeve, what do you think
that message means? All sisters are welcome to return to the Tower?
It makes no sense.&rdquo; That was not what she wanted to say, but at
least she was closing in on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Tower has its own rules,&rdquo; Thom said. &ldquo;What Aes
Sedai do, they do for reasons of their own, and often not for those
they give. If they give reasons at all.&rdquo; He and Juilin knew they
were only Accepted, of course; that was at least part of why
neither man did as he was told nearly as well as he might.</p>

<p>The struggle was plain on Nynaeve&rsquo;s face. She did not
like being interrupted, or people answering for her. There was
quite a list of things Nynaeve did not like. But it was only a
moment since she had thanked Thom; it could not be easy to call
down a man who had just saved you from being hauled off like a
cabbage. &ldquo;Very little in the Tower makes sense most of the time,&rdquo;
she said sourly. Elayne suspected that the tartness was as much for
Thom as the Tower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you believe what she said?&rdquo; Elayne took a deep
breath. &ldquo;About the Amyrlin saying I was to be brought back by any
means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The brief look Nynaeve gave her was touched with
sympathy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was telling the truth.&rdquo; Juilin turned one of the
chairs around and straddled it, leaning his staff against the back.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve questioned enough thieves and murderers to know truth when I
hear it. Part of the time she was too frightened to lie, and the
rest too angry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pair of you&mdash;&rdquo; Taking a deep breath,
Nynaeve tossed the scrip onto the table and folded her arms as if
to trap her hands away from her braid. &ldquo;I am afraid Juilin is
probably right, Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the Amyrlin knows what we are doing. She sent us
out of the Tower in the first place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve sniffed loudly. &ldquo;I can believe anything of
Siuan Sanche. I would like to have her for one hour where she could
not channel. We would see how tough she is then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne did not think that would make any difference.
Remembering that commanding blue gaze, she suspected Nynaeve would
earn a fine lot of bruises in the unlikely event that she ever got
her wish. &ldquo;But what are we going to do about it? The Ajahs have
eyes-and-ears everywhere, it seems. And the Amyrlin herself. We
could have women trying to slip things into our food all the way to
Tar Valon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if we do not look like what they expect.&rdquo;
Lifting a yellow jug out of the cupboard, Nynaeve set it on the
table beside the teapot. &ldquo;This is white henpepper. It will soothe a
toothache, but it will also turn your hair black as night.&rdquo; Elayne
put a hand to her red-gold tresses&mdash;her hair, not Nynaeve&rsquo;s,
she would wager!&mdash;but as much as she hated the idea, it was a
good one. &ldquo;A little needlework on some of those dresses in the
front, and we are not merchants anymore, but two ladies traveling
with their servants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Riding on a wagonload of dye?&rdquo; Juilin said.</p>

<p>Her level look said gratitude for saving her extended
only so far. &ldquo;There is a coach in a stableyard on the other side of
the bridge. I think the owner will sell it. If you go back to the
wagon before somebody steals it&mdash;I do not know what got into
you two, just leaving it for whoever came along!&mdash;if it is
still there, you can take one of the purses&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">A few people goggled when Noy Torvald&rsquo;s coach pulled
up in front of Ronde Macura&rsquo;s shop, drawn by a team of four, with
chests strapped to the roof and a saddled horse tied on behind. Noy
had lost everything when the trade with Tarabon collapsed; he was
scraping a living doing odd jobs for Widow Teran, now. No one in
the street had ever seen the coachman before, a tall leathery
fellow with long white mustaches and cold, imperious eyes, or the
dark, hard-faced footman in a Taraboner hat who jumped down nimbly
to open the coach door. The goggling turned to murmurs when two
women swept out of the shop with bundles in their arms; one wore a
green silk gown, the other plain blue wool, but each had a scarf
wrapped around her head so that not so much as a hint of her hair
was visible. They all but leaped into the coach.</p>

<p>Two of the Children began sauntering over to inquire
who the strangers were, but while the footman was still scrambling
up to the driver&rsquo;s seat, the coachman cracked his long whip,
shouting something about making way for a lady. Her name was lost
as the Children threw themselves out of the way, tumbling in the
dusty street, and the coach rumbled away at a gallop toward the
Amador Road.</p>

<p>The onlookers walked away talking among themselves; a
mysterious lady, obviously, with her maid, making purchases from
Ronde Macura and rushing away from the Children. Little enough
happened in Mardecin of late, and this would provide days of
conversation. The Children of the Light brushed themselves off
furiously, but finally decided that reporting the incident would
make them look foolish. Besides, their captain did not like nobles;
he would probably send them to bring the coach back, a long ride in
the heat for no more than an arrogant young sprig of one House or
another. If no charges could be brought&mdash;always tricky with
the nobility&mdash;it would not be the captain who took the blame.
Hoping that word of their humiliation did not spread, they
certainly never thought of questioning Ronde Macura.</p>

<p>A short time later, Therin Lugay led his cart into
the yard behind the shop, provisions for the long journey ahead
already packed away under the round canvas top. Indeed, Ronde
Macura had cured him of a fever that had taken twenty-three the
winter before, but it was a nagging wife and a shrewish
mother-in-law that made him glad of a journey all the way to where
the witches lived. Ronde had said someone might meet him, though
not who, but he hoped to make it to Tar Valon.</p>

<p>He tapped on the kitchen door six times before going
in, but it was not until he climbed the stairs that he found
anyone. In the back bedroom, Ronde and Luci lay stretched out on
the beds, sound asleep and fully clothed, if rather rumpled, with
the sun still in the sky. Neither woman roused when he shook them.
He did not understand that, or why one of the coverlets was lying
on the floor cut into knotted strips, or why there were two empty
teapots in the room but only one cup, or why a funnel was lying on
Ronde&rsquo;s pillow. But he had always known that there was a great deal
in the world he did not understand. Returning to his cart, he
thought about the supplies Ronde&rsquo;s money had purchased, thought of
his wife and her mother, and when he led the cart horse off, it was
with the intention of seeing what Altara was like, or maybe
Murandy.</p>

<p>One way and another, it was quite a time before a
disheveled Ronde Macura tottered up to Avi Shendar&rsquo;s house and sent
off a pigeon, a thin bone tube tied to its leg. The bird launched
itself north and east, straight as an arrow toward Tar Valon. After
a moment&rsquo;s thought, Ronde prepared another copy on another narrow
strip of thin parchment, and fastened it to a bird from another
coop. That one headed west, for she had promised to send duplicates
of all of her messages. In these hard times, a woman had to make
out as best she could, and there could be no harm in it, not the
sort of reports she made to Narenwin. Wondering if she could ever
get the taste of forkroot out of her mouth, she would not have
minded if the report brought just a little harm to the one who
called herself Nynaeve.</p>

<p>Hoeing in his garden patch as usual, Avi paid no
attention to what Ronde did. And as usual, as soon as she was gone,
he washed his hands and went inside. She had placed a larger sheet
of parchment underneath the strips to cushion the nib of the pen.
When he held it up to the afternoon light, he could make out what
she had written. Soon a third pigeon was on its way, heading in
still another direction.</p>
