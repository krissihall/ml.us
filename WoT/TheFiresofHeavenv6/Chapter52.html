<h4><em>Choices</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">L</span>aying
down his razor, Rand wiped the last flecks of
lather from his face and began doing up his shirt-laces. Early
morning sunlight streamed through the square arches leading to his
bedchamber balcony; the heavy winter curtains had been hung, but
tied back to let in a breath of air. He would be presentable when
he killed Rahvin. The thought loosed a bubble of rage, floating up
out of his belly. He forced it back down. He would be presentable,
and calm. Cold. No mistakes.</p>

<p>When he turned from the gilt-framed mirror, Aviendha
was sitting on her rolled-up pallet against the wall, beneath a
hanging portraying impossibly high gold towers. He had offered to
have another bed put in the room, but she claimed mattresses were
too soft for sleeping. She was watching him intently, her shift
forgotten in one hand. He had been careful about not looking around
from his shaving to give her time to dress, but aside from her
white stockings, she wore not a stitch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not shame you in front of other men,&rdquo; she
said abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shame me? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stood in one smooth motion, surprisingly pale
where the sun had not touched her, slender and hard-muscled, yet
with roundnesses and softnesses that haunted his dreams. This was
the first time he had allowed himself to look at her openly when
she flaunted herself, but she did not seem aware of it. Those big
blue-green eyes were fixed on his. &ldquo;I did not ask Sulin to include
Enaila or Somara or Lamelle that first day. Nor did I ask them to
watch you, or to do anything if you faltered. That was only their
own concern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You just let me think they would try to carry me off
like a babe if I wavered. A fine distinction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His wry tone flew right past her. &ldquo;It made you take
care when you needed to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said dryly. &ldquo;Well, I thank you for the
promise not to shame me, in any case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled. &ldquo;I did not say that, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. I said
not in front of other men. If you require it, for your own good&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her smile deepened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to come like that?&rdquo; He gestured
irritably, taking her in from head to toe.</p>

<p>She had never shown the slightest embarrassment at
being naked in front of him&mdash;far from it&mdash;but she
glanced down at herself, then at him looking at her, and her face
reddened. Suddenly she was surrounded by a flurry of dark brown
wool and white <em>algode</em>, flying into her clothes so quickly
that he could have thought she was channeling them on. &ldquo;Have you
arranged everything?&rdquo; came from the middle of it. &ldquo;Have you spoken
to the Wise Ones? You were gone late last night. Who else comes
with us? How many can you take? No wetlanders, I hope. You cannot
trust them. Especially not treekillers. Can you truly carry us to
Caemlyn in one hour? Is it like what I did the night&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? I mean
to say, how will you do it? I cannot like trusting myself to things
I do not know and cannot understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything is arranged, Aviendha.&rdquo; Why was she
babbling? And refusing to meet his eye? He had met with Rhuarc and
the other chiefs still near the city; they had not truly liked his
plan, but they saw it in terms of <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>, and none
thought he had any other choice. They discussed it quickly, agreed,
and then turned the talk to other things. Nothing to do with
Forsaken or Illian or battle at all. Women, hunting, whether
Cairhienin brandy could compare with <em>oosquai</em>, or wetlander
tabac with what was grown in the Waste. For an hour he had almost
forgotten what lay ahead. He hoped that the Prophecy of Rhuidean
was somehow wrong, that he would not destroy those men. The Wise
Ones had come to him, a delegation of more than fifty, alerted by
Aviendha herself and led by Amys and Melaine and Bair; or maybe by
Sorilea. With Wise Ones often it was difficult to tell who was in
charge. They had not come to talk him out of anything&mdash;<em>
ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em> again&mdash;but to make sure he understood that his
obligation to Elayne did not outweigh that to the Aiel, and they
had kept him in the meeting room until they were satisfied. It was
that or lift them bodily out of his way to reach the door. When
they wanted to be, those women were as good at ignoring shouts as
Egwene had become. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out how many I can take when I try.
Only Aiel.&rdquo; With luck, Meilan and Maringil and the rest would not
know he was gone until after he went. If the Tower had spies in
Cairhien, maybe the Forsaken did as well, and how could he trust
people to keep secrets who could not see the sun rise without
trying to use the fact in <em>Daes Dae&rsquo;mar</em>?</p>

<p>By the time he had shrugged into a red coat
embroidered in gold, a fine wool eminently suitable for a Royal
Palace, in Caemlyn or Cairhien&mdash;the thought amused him, in a
bleak sort of way&mdash;by that time, Aviendha was almost dressed.
It was a wonder to him how she could scramble into her clothes so
quickly and yet have nothing out of place. &ldquo;A woman came last night
while you were away.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Light!</em> He had forgotten Colavaere. &ldquo;What did
you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused in tying the laces of her blouse, eyes
trying to bore a hole in his head, but her tone was offhand. &ldquo;I
took her back to her own chambers, where we talked for a time.
There will be no more treekiller flipskirts scratching at your tent
flap, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very end I aimed at, Aviendha. Light! Did you
hurt her badly? You can&rsquo;t go around beating ladies. These people
cause me enough trouble without you bringing more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sniffed loudly and went back to her laces.
&ldquo;Ladies! A woman is a woman, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Unless she is a Wise One,&rdquo;
she added judiciously. &ldquo;That one sits lightly this morning, but her
bruises can be hidden, and with a day&rsquo;s rest she will be able to
leave her chambers. And she knows the right of matters, now. I told
her if she caused you any bother again&mdash;<em>any</em> bother&mdash;I would come talk to her once more. A much longer talk. She
will do as you say, when you say it. Her example will teach others.
The treekillers understand nothing else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand sighed. Not a method he would or could have
chosen, but it might actually work. Or it might only make Colavaere
and the others more sly from now on. Aviendha might not be worried
about repercussions against herself&mdash;in fact, he would be
surprised if she had even considered the possibility&mdash;but a
woman who was High Seat of a powerful House was not the same as a
young noblewoman of lesser rank. Whatever the effect for him,
Aviendha could find herself set upon in some dark hallway and given
ten times what she had given Colavaere, if not worse. &ldquo;Next time,
let me handle matters my way. I am the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>,
remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have shaving lather on your ear, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Muttering to himself, he snatched up the striped
towel and shouted, &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; to a rap at the door.</p>

<p>Asmodean entered, pale lace at the neck and cuffs of
his black coat, harpcase slung on his back and a sword at his hip.
It might have been winter for the coolness of his face, but his
dark eyes were wary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want, Natael?&rdquo; Rand demanded. &ldquo;I gave
you your instructions last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Asmodean wet his lips and glanced once at Aviendha,
who was frowning at him. &ldquo;Wise instructions. I suppose I might
learn something to your advantage, remaining here and watching, but
the talk this morning is all of the shrieks from Lady Colavaere&rsquo;s
apartments last night. It is said she displeased you, though no one
seems to know quite how. That uncertainty is making everyone step
lightly. I doubt anyone will breathe in the next few days without
considering what you might make of it.&rdquo; Aviendha&rsquo;s face was a
picture of insufferable self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you want to come with me?&rdquo; Rand said softly. &ldquo;You
want to be at my back when I face Rahvin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What better place for the Lord Dragon&rsquo;s bard? But
better yet, say under your eye. Where I can show my loyalty. I am
not strong.&rdquo; Asmodean&rsquo;s grimace seemed natural enough in any man
making that admission, but for an instant Rand sensed <em>
saidin</em> filling the other man, felt the taint that twisted
Asmodean&rsquo;s mouth. Just for an instant, but long enough for him to
judge. If Asmodean had drawn as much as he could, he would be hard
pressed to match one of the Wise Ones who could channel. &ldquo;Not
strong, yet perhaps I can help in some small way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand wished he could see the shield Lanfear had
woven. She had said it would dissipate with time, but Asmodean did
not seem able to channel any more strongly now than he had the
first day he was in Rand&rsquo;s hands. Perhaps she had lied, to give
Asmodean false hope, to make Rand believe the man would grow strong
enough to teach him more than he ever would. <em>It would be like
her</em>. He was uncertain whether that was his thought or Lews
Therin&rsquo;s, but he was sure it was true.</p>

<p>The long pause made Asmodean lick his lips again. &ldquo;A
day or two will not matter here. You will be back by then, or dead.
Let me prove my loyalty. Perhaps I can do something. A whisker more
weight on your side might shift the balance.&rdquo; Once more <em>
saidin</em> poured into him, just for a moment. Rand felt a
sensation of strain, yet it was still a feeble flow. &ldquo;You know my
choices. I am clinging to that tuft of grass on the cliff&rsquo;s lip,
praying for it to hold one more heartbeat. If you fail, I am worse
than dead. I must see you win and live.&rdquo; Suddenly eyeing Aviendha,
he seemed to realize he might have said too much. His laugh was a
hollow sound. &ldquo;Else how can I compose the songs of the Lord
Dragon&rsquo;s glory? A bard must have something to work with.&rdquo; The heat
never touched Asmodean&mdash;a trick of the mind, he claimed, not
the Power&mdash;but beads of sweat oozed down his forehead
now.</p>

<p>Under his eyes, or left behind? Perhaps to run
looking for a hiding place when he began wondering what was
happening in Caemlyn. Asmodean would be the man he was until he
died and was reborn, and perhaps even after. &ldquo;Under my eyes,&rdquo; Rand
said quietly. &ldquo;And if I even suspect that where that whisker falls
might displease me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I put my trust in the Lord Dragon&rsquo;s mercy,&rdquo; Asmodean
murmured, bowing. &ldquo;With the Lord Dragon&rsquo;s permission, I will wait
outside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand glanced around the room as the man departed,
backing away still half-bowed. His sword lay on the gilt-lined
chest at the foot of the bed, Dragon-buckled sword belt wrapped
around the scabbard and the Seanchan spearhead. The killing today
would not be with steel, not on his part. He touched his pocket,
felt the hard carved shape of the fat little man with his sword;
that was the only sword he needed today. For a moment, he
considered Skimming to Tear, to take back <em>Callandor</em>, or
even to Rhuidean for what was hidden there. He could destroy Rahvin
with either before the man knew he was there. He could destroy
Caemlyn itself with either. But could he trust himself? So much
power. So much of the One Power. <em>Saidin</em> hung there just
out of sight. The taint seemed part of him. Rage oozed just beneath
the surface, at Rahvin, at himself. If it broke loose, and he held
even <em>Callandor</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What would he do? He would be
invincible. With the other, he could Skim to Shayol Ghul itself,
put an end to it all, end it now one way or another. One way or
another. No. He was not in this alone. He could not afford anything
but victory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The world rides on my shoulders,&rdquo; he murmured.
Suddenly he yelped and clapped a hand to his left buttock. It felt
as though a needle had stabbed him, but he did not need the goose
bumps fading on his arms to tell him what had happened. &ldquo;What was
that for?&rdquo; he growled at Aviendha.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just to see whether the <em>Lord Dragon</em> was
still made of flesh like the rest of us mortals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; he said flatly, and seized <em>saidin</em>&mdash;all the sweetness; all the filth&mdash;just, long enough to
channel briefly.</p>

<p>Her eyes widened, but she did not flinch, only looked
at him as if nothing had occurred at all. Still, as they crossed
the anteroom, she rubbed furtively at her bottom when she thought
he was looking the other way. It seemed she was ordinary flesh,
too. <em>Burn me. I thought I&rsquo;d taught her a few manners.</em></p>

<p>Pulling open the door, he stepped out and stood
staring. Mat was leaning on his odd spear with that broad-brimmed
hat pulled low, a little apart from Asmodean, but that was not what took
him aback. There were no Maidens. He should have known something
was wrong when Asmodean came in unannounced. Aviendha was looking
around in amazement, as if she expected to find them behind one of
the tapestries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Melindhra tried to kill me last night,&rdquo; Mat said,
and Rand stopped thinking about Maidens. &ldquo;One minute we were
talking, the next she was trying to kick my head off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat told the story in short sentences. The dagger
with the golden bees. His conclusions. He closed his eyes when he
told how he had ended it&mdash;a simple, stark, &ldquo;I killed her&rdquo;&mdash;and opened them again quickly as if he saw something behind
his eyelids he did not care to see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you had to do that,&rdquo; Rand said quietly,
and Mat gave a bleak shrug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better her than me. I suppose. She was a
Darkfriend.&rdquo; He did not sound as if it made much difference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will settle Sammael. Just as soon as I&rsquo;m
ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how many will that leave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Forsaken are not here,&rdquo; Aviendha snapped. &ldquo;And
neither are the Maidens of the Spear. Where are they? What have you
done, Rand al&rsquo;Thor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me? There were twenty right here when I came to bed
last night, and I haven&rsquo;t seen one since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is because Mat&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Asmodean began, and
stopped when Mat looked at him, a tight-mouthed blend of pain and
readiness to hit something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not be fools,&rdquo; Aviendha said in a firm voice.
&ldquo;<em>Far Dareis Mai</em> would not claim <em>toh</em> against Mat
Cauthon for this. She tried to kill him, and he killed her. Even
her near-sisters would not, if she had had any. And no one would
claim <em>toh</em> against Rand al&rsquo;Thor for what another did,
unless he ordered it done. <em>You</em> have done something, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor, something great and dark, or they would be here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done nothing,&rdquo; he told her sharply. &ldquo;And I
don&rsquo;t intend to stand here discussing it. Are you dressed for the
ride south, Mat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat shoved a hand into his coat pocket, fingering
something. He usually kept his dice and dice-cup in there.
&ldquo;Caemlyn. I&rsquo;m tired of them sneaking up on me. I want to sneak up
on one of them for a change. I just hope I get the bloody pat on
the head instead of the bloody flower,&rdquo; he added with a
grimace.</p>

<p>Rand did not ask him what he meant. Another <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em>. Two together to twist chance perhaps. No way to tell
<em>how</em>, or even <em>if</em>, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;It seems like we&rsquo;ll be
together a little longer.&rdquo; Mat looked more resigned than anything
else.</p>

<p>Before they had gone far down the tapestry-lined
corridor, Moiraine and Egwene met them, gliding along together as
if the day held no more ahead than a walk in one of the gardens.
Egwene, cool-eyed and calm, golden Great Serpent on her finger,
really could have been Aes Sedai despite her Aiel clothes and shawl
and the folded scarf around her temples, while Moiraine&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Gold
threads caught the light, faintly streaking Moiraine&rsquo;s gown of
shimmering blue silk. The small blue stone on her forehead, hanging
from its gold chain fastened in her waves of dark hair, shone as
brightly as the large gold-set sapphires around her neck. Hardly
suitable garb for what they intended, yet in his red coat, Rand
could not comment.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was being here, where House Damodred had
once held the Sun Throne, but Moiraine&rsquo;s graceful carriage was more
regal than he remembered ever seeing it. Not even the presence of
&ldquo;Jasin Natael&rdquo; could spoil that queenly serenity with surprise, but
amazingly, she gave Mat a warm smile. &ldquo;So you are going too, Mat.
Learn to trust the Pattern. Do not waste your life attempting to
change what cannot be changed.&rdquo; From Mat&rsquo;s face, he might have been
considering changing his mind about being there at all, but the Aes
Sedai turned from him without a trace of worry. &ldquo;These are for you,
Rand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More letters?&rdquo; he said. One bore his name in an
elegant hand that he recognized immediately. &ldquo;From you, Moiraine?&rdquo;
The other carried Thom Merrilin&rsquo;s name. Both had been sealed with
blue wax, apparently with her Great Serpent ring, impressed with
the image of the snake biting its own tail. &ldquo;Why write me a letter?
And sealed. You&rsquo;ve never been afraid to say whatever you wanted to
say to my face. If I ever forgot it, Aviendha has been reminding me
that I&rsquo;m only flesh and blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have changed from the boy I first saw outside
the Winespring Inn.&rdquo; Her voice was a soft silver chiming. &ldquo;You are
hardly the same at all. I pray you have changed enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene murmured something low. Rand thought it was &ldquo;I
pray you have not changed too much.&rdquo; She was frowning at the
letters as if she too wondered what was in them. So was
Aviendha.</p>

<p>Moiraine went on more brightly, even briskly. &ldquo;Seals
ensure privacy. That contains things I wish you to think on; not
now; when you have time for thinking. As for Thom&rsquo;s letter, I know
no safer hands than yours in which to place it. Give it to him when
you see him again. Now, there is something you must see at the
docks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The docks?&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Moiraine, this morning of
all mornings, I&rsquo;ve no time for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she was already moving down the corridor as if
sure he would follow. &ldquo;I have had horses readied. Even one for you,
Mat, just in case.&rdquo; Egwene hesitated only a moment, then
followed.</p>

<p>Rand opened his mouth to call Moiraine back. She had
sworn to obey. Whatever she had to show him, he could see it
another day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What could an hour hurt?&rdquo; Mat muttered. Perhaps he
was reconsidering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would not be amiss for you to be seen this
morning,&rdquo; Asmodean said. &ldquo;Rahvin might just know of it as soon as
it happens. If he has any suspicions&mdash;if he has any spies who
may have listened at keyholes&mdash;it might allay them for
today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand looked at Aviendha. &ldquo;Do you also counsel
delay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I counsel that you listen to Moiraine Sedai. Only
fools ignore Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What could be at the docks more important than
Rahvin?&rdquo; he growled, then shook his head. There was a saying in the
Two Rivers, not that anybody said it where women could hear. &ldquo;The
Creator made women to please the eye and trouble the mind.&rdquo; Aes
Sedai were certainly no different in one respect. &ldquo;One hour.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The sun was not yet high enough to lift the city
wall&rsquo;s long shadow from the stone quay where Kadere&rsquo;s wagons were
lined up, but he still mopped his face with a large handkerchief.
It was only partly the heat that made him sweat. Great gray
curtain walls stretching into the river at either end of the row of
docks made the quay seem a dim box, with him caught in it. There
were nothing but broad, round-bowed grain barges docked here, and
the same anchored in the river waiting their turn to unload. He had
considered slipping onto one when it cast off, but it meant
abandoning most of what he still possessed. Yet had he thought the
slow passage downriver would take him anywhere except to his death,
he would have. Lanfear had not returned to his dreams, but he had
the burns on his chest to remind him of her commands. Just the
thought of disobeying one of the Chosen made him shiver, even with
sweat rolling down his face.</p>

<p>If only he knew who to trust; to the extent it was
possible to trust any of his fellow Darkfriends. The last of his
drivers who had sworn the oaths had vanished two days ago, very
likely on one of the grain barges. He still did not know which Aiel
woman had slipped that note under his wagon door&mdash;&ldquo;You are not
alone among strangers. A way has been chosen&rdquo;&mdash;though he had
several possibilities in mind. The docks held almost as many Aiel
as they did workmen, come to stare at the river; he had seen a few
of those faces more often than seemed reasonable, and some had
looked at him consideringly. A few Cairhienin had as well, and a
Tairen lord. That meant nothing by itself, of course, but if he
could find a few men to work with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A mounted party appeared in one of the gateways,
Moiraine and Rand al&rsquo;Thor leading the way with the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s
Warder as they threaded though the carts hauling grain-sacks away.
A wave of cheers rode with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All glory to the Lord Dragon!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hail the Lord
Dragon!&rdquo; and now and again &ldquo;Glory to Lord Matrim! Glory to the Red
Hand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For once the Aes Sedai turned down toward the tail
end of the line of wagons without so much as a glance at Kadere. He
was just as glad. Even if she had not been Aes Sedai, even if she
had not looked at him as if she knew every black corner of his
mind, he would as soon not have looked too closely at some of the
things she had filled his wagons with. Yesterday evening she had
made him strip the canvas off that oddly twisted redstone doorframe
in the wagon just behind his. She seemed to take a perverse delight
in making him help her himself with whatever she wanted to study.
He would have covered the thing up again if he could bear to go
near it, or could make any of his drivers do so. None with him now
had seen Herid fall half through it in Rhuidean and half disappear&mdash;Herid had been the first to run away once they cleared the
Jangai; the man had not been entirely right in the head after the
Warder hauled him back&mdash;but they could look at it, see the
way the corners did not meet properly, how you could not follow it
around with your eyes without blinking and growing dizzy.</p>

<p>Kadere ignored the first three riders as much as the
Aes Sedai had ignored him, and Mat Cauthon almost as much. The man
was wearing <em>his</em> hat; he had never been able to find a
replacement. The Aiel wench, Aviendha, rode up behind the young Aes
Sedai&rsquo;s saddle, both with their skirts pushed up to show their
legs. If he needed any confirmation that the Aiel woman was bedding
al&rsquo;Thor, he only had to see the way she looked at him; a woman who
had taken a man to her bed always looked at him with that light of
ownership in her eyes after. More importantly, Natael was with
them. This was the first time Kadere had been this close to him
since crossing the Spine of the World. Natael, who stood high in the
Darkfriends. If he could get past the Maidens to reach Natael&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suddenly Kadere blinked. Where were the Maidens?
Al&rsquo;Thor always had an escort of spear-wielding women. Frowning, he
realized he could not see a single Maiden among the Aiel on the
quay or the docks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to look at an old friend,
Hadnan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That melodious voice jerked Kadere around, gaping at
a hatchet-nosed face, dark eyes almost hidden by rolls of fat.
&ldquo;Keille?&rdquo; It was impossible. No one survived alone in the Waste
except Aiel. She <em>had</em> to be dead. But there she stood,
white silk straining over her bulk, ivory combs standing tall in
her dark curls.</p>

<p>A faint smile on her lips, she turned with a grace
that still surprised him in a woman so large and lightly climbed
the steps into his wagon.</p>

<p>For a moment he hesitated, then hurried after her. He
would as soon Keille Shaogi really had died in the Waste&mdash;the
woman was bossy and obnoxious; she need not think she was getting a
penny of the little he had managed to salvage&mdash;but she stood
as high as Jasin Natael. Perhaps she would answer a few questions.
At the least, he would have someone to work with. At the worst,
someone to put blame on. Power went with standing high, but so did
blame for the failures of those beneath you. More than once he had
fed his superiors to those still higher up in order to cover
himself.</p>

<p>Carefully closing the door, he turned&mdash;and
would have screamed if his throat had not clenched too tight for
sound.</p>

<p>The woman who stood there wore white silk, but she
was not fat. She was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen,
eyes like dark, bottomless mountain pools, woven silver belting her
narrow waist, silver crescents in her shimmering black hair. Kadere
knew that face from his dreams.</p>

<p>His knees thudding to the floor shook breath loose.
&ldquo;Great Mistress,&rdquo; he said hoarsely, &ldquo;how may I serve?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lanfear might have been looking at an insect, one she
might crush beneath her slipper or might not. &ldquo;By showing your
obedience to my commands. I have been too busy to watch Rand
al&rsquo;Thor myself. Tell me what he has done, aside from conquering
Cairhien, what he plans to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is difficult, Great Mistress. One such as myself
cannot come close to such as he.&rdquo; An insect, those cool eyes said,
allowed to live so long as it was useful. Kadere racked his brain
for everything he had seen or heard or imagined. &ldquo;He is sending
Aiel south in huge numbers, Great Mistress, though I do not know
why. The Tairens and Cairhienin do not seem to notice, but I don&rsquo;t
think they can tell one Aiel from another.&rdquo; Neither could he. He
would not dare lie to her, but if she thought he had more use than
he did&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;He has founded a school of some sort, in a city palace
that belonged to a House with no survivors&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; At first there
was no way to tell whether she liked what she was hearing, but as
he went on, her face began to darken.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">&ldquo;What is it you want me to see, Moiraine?&rdquo; Rand said
impatiently, tying Jeade&rsquo;en&rsquo;s reins to one wheel of the last wagon
in line.</p>

<p>She was standing on tiptoe to peer over the side of
the wagonbed at a pair of casks that seemed familiar. Unless he was
mistaken, they held the two <em>cuendillar</em> seals, packed in
wool for protection now that they were no longer unbreakable. He
felt the Dark One&rsquo;s taint strongly here; it almost seemed to come
from the casks, a faint miasma as from something rotting in a
hidden place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be safe here,&rdquo; Moiraine murmured. Lifting
her skirts gracefully, she started up the line of wagons. Lan
heeled her, a half-tame wolf, the cloak hanging down his back all
disturbing ripples of color and nothingness.</p>

<p>Rand glared. &ldquo;Did she tell you what it was,
Egwene?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just that you had to see something. That you had to
come here, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must trust Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Aviendha said, almost as
levelly, but with a hint of doubt. Mat snorted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I mean to find out now. Natael, go tell Bael
I&rsquo;ll be with him in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the other end of the line, the side of Kadere&rsquo;s
wagon exploded, splinters scything down Aiel and townsfolk. Rand
knew; he did not need goose bumps prickling his skin to know. He
raced, toward the wagon, after Moiraine and Lan. Time seemed to
slow, everything happening at once, as if the air were jelly
clinging to each moment.</p>

<p>Lanfear stepped out into stunned silence except for
the moans and screams of the injured, something limp and pale and
red-streaked hanging from her hand, dragging behind her as she
walked down invisible steps. Her face was a mask carved of ice. &ldquo;He
told me, Lews Therin,&rdquo; she almost screamed, flinging the pale thing
into the air. Something caught it, inflated it for a moment into a
bloody, transparent, statue of Hadnan Kadere; his skin, removed
whole. The figure collapsed and fell as Lanfear&rsquo;s voice rose to a
screech. &ldquo;You let another woman touch you! Again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moments clinging, all happening at once.</p>

<p>Before Lanfear reached the stones of the quay,
Moiraine lifted her skirts higher and began running straight toward
her. Quick as she was, Lan was quicker, ignoring her shout of, &ldquo;No,
Lan!&rdquo; Sword coming out, long legs carried him ahead of her,
color-shifting cloak waving behind as he charged. Suddenly he
seemed to run into an invisible stone wall, bounce back, try to
stagger forward again. One step, and as if a giant hand had smashed
him aside, he flew ten paces through the air, crashing to the
stones.</p>

<p>While he was in midair, Moiraine jerked forward, feet
skidding along the pavement, until she was face to face with
Lanfear. It was only for a moment. The Forsaken looked at her as
though wondering what could have gotten in her way, then Moiraine
was flung to one side so hard she rolled over and over until she
disappeared beneath one of the wagons.</p>

<p>The quayside was in turmoil. Just moments since
Kadere&rsquo;s wagon erupted, yet only the blind could not know the One
Power was being wielded by the woman in white. Along the docks axes
flashed, cutting ropes, freeing barges as their crews desperately
fended the craft toward open water and flight. Bare-chested dockmen
and dark-clothed townsfolk struggled to jump aboard. In the other
direction men and women milled and screamed as they fought to pass
through the gates into the city. And among them, <em>
cadin&rsquo;sor</em>-clad figures veiled themselves and rushed at Lanfear
with spears or knives or bare hands. There could be no doubt she
was the source of the attack, no doubt she fought with the Power.
They ran to dance the spears regardless.</p>

<p>Fire rolled over them in waves. Arrows of it pierced
those who came on with their clothes in flames. It was not as if
Lanfear battled them, or even paid them any real mind. She might
have been brushing aside gnats or bitemes. Those who fled burned as
well as those who tried to fight. She moved toward Rand as if
nothing else existed.</p>

<p>Heartbeats only.</p>

<p>Three steps she had taken when Rand seized the male
half of the True Source, molten steel and steel-shattering ice,
sweet honey and midden heap. Deep in the Void, the fight for
survival was distant, the battle before him scarcely less. As
Moiraine vanished beneath the wagon, he channeled, pulling the heat
from Lanfear&rsquo;s fires, sinking it into the river. Flames that a
moment before engulfed human forms, vanished. In the same instant
he wove the flows again, and a misty gray dome came into being, a
long oval enclosing him and Lanfear and most of the wagons, an
almost transparent wall that shut out all not already within. Even
as he tied the weave, he was not sure what it was or where it had
come from&mdash;some memory of Lews Therin&rsquo;s perhaps&mdash;but
Lanfear&rsquo;s fires struck it and stopped. He could see people outside
dimly, too many thrashing and flailing&mdash;he had taken the
flames, not the searing of flesh; that stench still hung in the air&mdash;but none would burn now that had not already. Bodies lay
inside, too, mounds of charred cloth, some stirring feebly,
moaning. She did not care; her channeled flames winked out; the
gnats were dispelled; she never glanced aside.</p>

<p>Heartbeats. He was cold in the emptiness of the Void,
and if he felt sorrow for the dead and dying and scarred, the
feeling was so far off it might not have been. He was cold itself.
Emptiness itself. Only the rage of <em>saidin</em> filled him.</p>

<p>Movement to either side. Aviendha and Egwene, eyes
concentrated on Lanfear. He had meant to shut them out from this.
They must have raced with him. Mat and Asmodean; outside; the wall
missed the final few wagons. In icy calm he channeled Air to snare
Lanfear; Egwene and Aviendha could shield her while he distracted
her.</p>

<p>Something severed his flows; they snapped back so
hard that he grunted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of them?&rdquo; Lanfear snarled. &ldquo;Which is Aviendha?&rdquo;
Egwene threw her head back and wailed, eyes bulging, the world&rsquo;s
agony shrieking from her mouth. &ldquo;Which?&rdquo; Aviendha rose on tiptoes,
shuddering, howls chasing Egwene&rsquo;s as they climbed higher and
higher.</p>

<p>The thought was suddenly there in the emptiness. <em>
Spirit woven so, with Fire and Earth. There</em>. Rand felt
something being cut, something he could not see, and Egwene
collapsed in a motionless heap, Aviendha to hands and knees, head
down and swaying.</p>

<p>Lanfear staggered, her eyes going from the women to
him, dark pools of black fire. &ldquo;You are mine, Lews Therin!
Mine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Rand&rsquo;s voice seemed to come to his ears down a
mile-long tunnel. <em>Distract her from the girls</em>. He kept
moving forward, did not look back. &ldquo;I was never yours, Mierin. I
will always belong to Ilyena.&rdquo; The Void quivered with sorrow and
loss. And with desperation, as he fought something besides the
scouring of <em>saidin</em>. For a moment he hung balanced. <em>I
am Rand al&rsquo;Thor</em>. And, <em>Ilyena, ever and always my
heart</em>. Balanced on a razor edge. <em>I am Rand al&rsquo;Thor!</em>
Other thoughts tried to well up, a fountain of them, of Ilyena, of
Mierin, of what he could do to defeat her. He forced them down,
even the last. If he came down on the wrong side&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>I am
Rand al&rsquo;Thor!</em> &ldquo;Your name is Lanfear, and I&rsquo;ll die before I
love one of the Forsaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something that might have been anguish crossed her
face; then it was a marble mask once more. &ldquo;If you are not mine,&rdquo;
she said coldly, &ldquo;then you are dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agony in his chest, as if his heart was about to
explode, in his head, white-hot nails driving into his brain, pain
so strong that inside the Void he wanted to scream. Death was
there, and he knew it. Frantically&mdash;even in the Void,
frantic; emptiness shimmered, dwindled&mdash;he wove Spirit and
Fire and Earth, flailing it wildly. His heart was no longer
beating. Fingers of dark pain crushing the Void. Gray veil falling
over his eyes. He felt his weave slice raggedly through hers. The
burn of breath in empty lungs, lurch of heart beginning to pump
again. He could see again, silver and black flecks floated between
him and a stone-faced Lanfear still catching her balance from the
rebound of her flows. The pain was there in head and chest like
wounds, but the Void firmed, and bodily pain was remote.</p>

<p>Well that it was distant, for he had no time to
recover. Forcing himself to move forward, he struck at her with
Air, a club to knock her senseless. She slashed the weave, and he
struck again, again, again each time that she sliced through his
last weave, a furious rain of blows she somehow saw and countered,
always moving closer. If he could keep her occupied for a moment
more, if one of those invisible cudgels landed on her head, if he
could get close enough to strike her with his fist&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Unconscious, she would be as helpless as anyone else.</p>

<p>Suddenly she seemed to realize what he was doing.
Still blocking his blows as easily as if she could see every one,
she danced backwards until her shoulders hit the wagon behind her.
And she smiled like winter&rsquo;s heart. &ldquo;You will die slowly, and beg
me to let you love me before you die,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>It was not at him directly that she struck this time.
It was at his link to <em>saidin</em>.</p>

<p>Panic rang the Void like a gong at the first
knife-sharp touch, the Power diminishing as it slid deeper between
him and the Source. With Spirit and Fire and Earth he cut at the
knife blade; he knew where to find it; he knew where his link was,
could feel that first nick. Her attempted shield vanished,
reappeared, returned as fast as he could cut it, but always with
that momentary ebbing of <em>saidin</em>, moments when it almost
failed, leaving his counterstroke barely enough to foil her attack.
Handling two weaves at once should have been easy&mdash;he could
handle ten or more&mdash;but not when one was a desperate defense
against something he could not know was there until it was almost
too late. Not when another man&rsquo;s thoughts kept trying to surface
inside the Void, trying to tell him how to defeat her. If he
listened, it might be Lews Therin Telamon who walked away, with
Rand al&rsquo;Thor a voice sometimes floating in his head if that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make <em>both</em> of those trulls watch you
beg,&rdquo; Lanfear said. &ldquo;But should I make them watch you die first, or
you them?&rdquo; When had she climbed into the open wagon-bed? He had to
watch her, watch for any hint that she was tiring, her
concentration slipping. It was a vain hope. Standing beside the
twisted doorframe <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, she looked down at him, a
queen about to pass sentence, yet she could spare time for chill
smiles at a dark ivory bracelet that she turned over and over in
her fingers. &ldquo;Which will hurt you most, Lews Therin? I want you to
hurt. I want you to know pain such as no man has ever known!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The thicker the flow to him from the Source, the
harder it would be to cut. His hand tightened on his coat pocket,
the fat little stone man with his sword hard against the heron
branded into his palm. He drew on <em>saidin</em> as deeply as he
could, till the taint floated in the emptiness with him like
misting rain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pain, Lews Therin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And there was pain, the world swallowed in agony. Not
heart or head this time, but everywhere, every part of him, hot
needles stabbing into the Void. He almost thought he could hear a
quenching hiss at each thrust, and each came deeper than the last.
Her attempts to shield him did not slow; they came faster,
stronger. He could not believe she was so strong. Clinging to the
Void, to searing, freezing <em>saidin</em>, he defended himself
wildly. He could end it, finish her. He could call down lightning,
or wrap her in the fire she herself had used to kill.</p>

<p>Images darted through the pain: A woman in a dark
merchant&rsquo;s dress, toppling from her horse, the fire-red sword light
in his hands; she had come to kill him, with a fistful of other
Darkfriends. Mat&rsquo;s bleak eyes; <em>I killed her</em>. A
golden-haired woman lying in a ruined hallway where, it seemed, the
very walls had melted and flowed. <em>Ilyena, forgive me!</em> It
was a despairing cry.</p>

<p>He could end it. Only, he could not. He was going to
die, perhaps the world would die, but he could not make himself
kill another woman. Somehow it seemed the richest joke the world
had ever seen.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Wiping the blood from her mouth, Moiraine crawled out
from beneath the tail of the wagon and rose unsteadily to her feet,
the sound of a man&rsquo;s laughter in her ears. In spite of herself, her
eyes darted, searching for Lan, found him lying almost against the
foggy gray wall of the dome that stretched overhead. He twitched,
perhaps trying to find strength to rise, perhaps dying. She forced
him out of her mind. He had saved her life so many times that by
rights it should have belonged to him, but she had long since done
what she could to see that he survived his lone war with the
Shadow. Now he must live or die without her.</p>

<p>It was Rand laughing, on his knees on the stones of
the quay. Laughing, with tears streaming down a face twisted like a
man being put to the question. Moiraine felt a chill. If the
madness had him, it was beyond her. She could only do what she
could do. What she must do.</p>

<p>The sight of Lanfear hit her like a blow. Not
surprise, but the shock of seeing what had been in her dreams so
often since Rhuidean. Lanfear standing on the wagon-bed, blazing
bright as the sun with <em>saidar</em>, framed by the twisted
redstone <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> as she stared down at Rand, a
pitiless smile on her lips. She was turning a bracelet in her
hands. An <em>angreal</em>; unless Rand had his own <em>
angreal</em>, she should be able to crush him with that. Either he
did, or Lanfear was toying with him. It did not matter. Moiraine
did not like that circle of carved age-dark ivory. At first glance
it seemed to be an acrobat bending backwards to grip his ankles.
Only a closer look would show that his wrists and ankles were bound
together. She did not like it, but she had brought it out of
Rhuidean. Yesterday she had taken the bracelet from a sack of
odds-and-ends and left it lying there at the foot of the
doorframe.</p>

<p>Moiraine was slight, a small woman. Her weight did
not disturb the wagon at all as she pulled herself up. She winced
as her dress caught on a splinter and tore, but Lanfear did not
look around. The woman had dealt with every threat except Rand; he
was the only corner of the world she acknowledged in the least
right then.</p>

<p>Suppressing a small bubble of hope&mdash;she could
not allow herself that luxury&mdash;Moiraine balanced upright a
moment on the wagon-tail, then embraced the True Source and leaped
at Lanfear. The Forsaken had an instant&rsquo;s warning, enough to turn
before Moiraine struck her, clawing the bracelet away. Face to
face, they toppled through the doorframe <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>.
White light swallowed everything.</p>
