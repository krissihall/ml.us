<h4><em>To Teach, and Learn</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">S</span>ome
four hours later, the sweat running down
Nynaeve&rsquo;s face had very little to do with unseasonable heat, and
she was wondering whether it might not have been better if Neres
had gulled them. Or refused to carry them beyond Boannda. Late
afternoon sunlight slanted sharply through windows with mostly
cracked panes. Clutching her skirts in blended irritation and
unease, she tried to avoid looking at the six Aes Sedai grouped
around one of the sturdy tables near the wall. Their mouths moved
silently as they conferred behind a screen of <em>saidar</em>.
Elayne had her chin high, her hands folded calmly at her waist, but
a tightness about her eyes and the corners of her mouth spoiled her
regal air. Nynaeve was not sure she wanted to know what the Aes
Sedai were saying; one stunning blow after another had knocked all
her high expectations into a daze. One more shock and she thought
she might scream, and she did not know whether from fury or pure
hysteria.</p>

<p>Very nearly everything except their clothes was laid
out on that table, from Birgitte&rsquo;s silver arrow in front of stout
Morvrin to the three <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> before Sheriam, to the
gilded coffers in front of dark-eyed Myrelle. Not one of the women
looked pleased. Carlinya&rsquo;s face might have been carved from snow,
even motherly Anaiya wore a stern mask, and Beonin&rsquo;s look of
constant wide-eyed startlement had a distinctly annoyed cast.
Annoyed and something more. Sometimes Beonin made as if to touch
the white cloth spread neatly over the <em>cuendillar</em> seal,
but her hand always stopped and retreated.</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s eyes jerked away from the cloth. She knew
exactly when things had begun to go wrong. The Warders who
surrounded them in. the woods had been proper, if cool&mdash;once
she made Uno and the Shienarans put up their swords, anyway. And
Min&rsquo;s warm greetings had been all laughter and hugs. But the Aes
Sedai and others in the streets, caught up in their own errands,
had scurried along with hardly a glance for the party being
escorted in. Salidar was quite crowded, with armed men drilling in
nearly every open space. The first person aside from the Warders
and Min to pay any attention to them at all had been the lean Brown
sister they were taken to, in what had once been the common room of
this inn. She and Elayne had told the story they had agreed on to
Phaedrine Sedai, or tried to. Five minutes into it, they were left
standing, with strict orders not to move a foot or speak a word,
even to each other. Ten more minutes, staring at one another in
confusion, while all around them Accepted and white-clad novices,
Warders and servants and soldiers bustled between tables where Aes
Sedai pored over papers and briskly handed out orders, and then
they had been hustled before Sheriam and the others so quickly
Nynaeve did not think her shoes had touched the floor twice. That
was when the grilling had begun, more suitable for captured
prisoners than returning heroes. Nynaeve dabbed at the perspiration
on her face, but as soon as she tucked the handkerchief back up her
sleeve, her hands returned to their grip on her skirts.</p>

<p>She and Elayne were not alone standing on the
colorful silk carpet. Siuan, in a plain dress of fine blue wool,
might have been there by choice if Nynaeve had not known better,
her face cool, utterly composed. She seemed lost in untroubled
thought. Leane at least watched the Aes Sedai, yet she appeared
equally confident. In fact, somehow more self-confident than
Nynaeve remembered. The copper-skinned woman looked even more
willowy, too, more supple in some fashion. Perhaps it was her
scandalous dress. That pale green silk was every bit as high-necked
as Siuan&rsquo;s, but it clung to every curve of her, and the material
only managed to be opaque by a thin hair. It was their faces that
truly stunned Nynaeve, though. She had never expected to find
either alive, and certainly never looking so very young&mdash;no
more than a few years older than she if that. They did not so much
as glance at one another. In truth, she thought she detected a
distinct chill between them.</p>

<p>There was another difference about them, one that
Nynaeve was just beginning to recognize. If everyone including Min
had been ginger about it, no one made any real secret of the fact
that they had been stilled. Nynaeve could feel that lack. Perhaps
it was being in a room where all the other women could channel, or
perhaps it was knowing they had been stilled, but for the first
time she was truly conscious of the ability in Elayne and the
others. And its absence from Siuan and Leane. Something had been
taken from them, cut away. It was like a wound. Perhaps the worst
wound a woman could suffer.</p>

<p>Curiosity overcame her. What sort of wound would it
be? What had been cut away? She might as well make use of the
waiting, and the irritation that larded itself through her
nervousness. She reached out to <em>saidar</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did anyone grant you permission to channel here,
Accepted?&rdquo; Sheriam asked, and Nynaeve gave a start, hurriedly
releasing the True Source.</p>

<p>The green-eyed Aes Sedai led the others back to their
mismatched chairs, arranged on the carpet in a semicircle that had
the four standing women as its focus. Some of them carried things
from the table. They sat staring at Nynaeve, earlier emotion
swallowed in Aes Sedai calm. None of those ageless faces
acknowledged the heat by so much as a single bead of moisture.
Finally Anaiya said in a gently chiding voice, &ldquo;You have been very
long from us, child. Whatever you have learned in the interval, you
have apparently forgotten much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blushing, Nynaeve curtsied. &ldquo;Forgive me, Aes Sedai. I
did not mean to overstep.&rdquo; She hoped they thought it was shame that
heated her cheeks. She had been away from them a long time. Just
one day ago, she had given the orders and people jumped when she
spoke. Now she was the one expected to jump. It galled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You tell an interesting&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;story.&rdquo; Carlinya
obviously believed little of it. The White sister turned Birgitte&rsquo;s
silver arrow over in long slender hands. &ldquo;And you acquired some
strange possessions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Panarch Amathera gave us many gifts, Aes Sedai,&rdquo;
Elayne said. &ldquo;She seemed to think we saved her throne.&rdquo; Even
delivered in a perfectly level voice, that speech was a walk on
thin ice. Nynaeve was not the only one irritated by their fall from
freedom. Carlinya&rsquo;s smooth face tightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You come with disturbing news,&rdquo; Sheriam said. &ldquo;And
some disturbing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;things.&rdquo; Her slightly tilted eyes wandered to
the table, to the silvery <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>, and returned firmly to
Elayne and Nynaeve. Since learning what it was, what it was for,
most of the Aes Sedai had treated it like a live red adder. Most
had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the thing does what these children claim,&rdquo;
Morvrin said absently, &ldquo;we need to study it. And if Elayne really
believes she can make a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The Brown
sister shook her head. Her real attention was on the flattened
stone ring, all flecked and striped in red and blue and brown, that
she held in one hand. The other two <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> lay on her
broad lap. &ldquo;You say that this came from Verin Sedai? How is it this
was never mentioned to us before?&rdquo; That was not directed at Nynaeve
or Elayne, but at Siuan.</p>

<p>Siuan frowned, but not the fierce frown Nynaeve
remembered. It held a touch of diffidence, as if she knew she was
speaking to her superiors, and so did her voice. That was another
change Nynaeve could hardly believe. &ldquo;Verin never told me of it. I
would very much like to ask her a few questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And <em>I</em> have questions about <em>this</em>.&rdquo;
Myrelle&rsquo;s olive face darkened as she unfolded a familiar paper&mdash;why had they ever kept that?&mdash;and read aloud. &ldquo;What
the bearer does is done at my order and by my authority. Obey, and
keep silent, at my command. Siuan Sanche, Watcher of the Seals,
Flame of Tar Valon, The Amyrlin Seat.&rdquo; She crumpled the paper and
its seal in her fist. &ldquo;Hardly something to be handed out to
Accepted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the time, I did not know who I could trust,&rdquo;
Siuan said smoothly. The six Aes Sedai stared at her. &ldquo;It was
within my authority then.&rdquo; The six Aes Sedai did not blink. Her
voice took on a thread of exasperated pleading. &ldquo;You cannot call me
to account for doing what I had to do when I had a perfect right to
do it. When the boat&rsquo;s sinking, you plug the hole with what you can
find.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why did you not tell us?&rdquo; Sheriam asked quietly,
but with a hint of steel. As Mistress of Novices she had never
raised her voice, though sometimes you wished she would. &ldquo;Three
Accepted&mdash;Accepted!&mdash;sent out of the Tower chasing
thirteen full sisters of the Black Ajah. Do you use babies to plug
the hole in your boat, Siuan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are hardly babies,&rdquo; Nynaeve told her heatedly.
&ldquo;Several of those thirteen are dead, and we thwarted their plans
twice. In Tear, we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carlinya cut her off like an icy knife. &ldquo;You have
told us all about Tear, child. And Tanchico. And defeating
Moghedien.&rdquo; Her mouth twisted wryly. She had already said that
Nynaeve had been a fool to come within a mile of one of the
Forsaken, that she was lucky to have escaped with her life. That
Carlinya did not know how right she was&mdash;they certainly had
not told everything&mdash;only made Nynaeve&rsquo;s stomach clench
tighter. &ldquo;You <em>are</em> children, and lucky if we decide not to
spank you. Now hold your peace until you are called on to speak.&rdquo;
Nynaeve flushed heavily, hoping they took it for embarrassment, and
held her peace.</p>

<p>Sheriam had never taken her eyes from Siuan. &ldquo;Well?
Why have you never mentioned sending three children out to hunt
lions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan drew a deep breath, but folded her hands and
ducked her head penitently. &ldquo;There seemed no point, Aes Sedai, with
so much else of importance. I have held nothing back, when there
was the faintest reason for telling. Every scrap I knew of the
Black Ajah, I told. I&rsquo;ve not known where these two were or what
they were up to for some time. The important thing is that they are
here now, and with those three <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. You must
realize what it means to have access to Elaida&rsquo;s study, to her
papers, if only in bits. You&rsquo;d never have known that she knows
where you are until it was too late, except for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We realize that,&rdquo; Anaiya said, eyeing Morvrin, who
was still frowning at the ring. &ldquo;It is just that perhaps the means
of it takes us a little by surprise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>,&rdquo; Myrelle breathed. &ldquo;Why, it
has become no more than a matter for scholarly discussion in the
Tower, almost a legend. And Aiel Dreamwalkers. Who would have
imagined that Aiel Wise Ones could channel, much less this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve wished they had been able to keep that secret&mdash;like Birgitte&rsquo;s true identity and a few other things they
had managed to hold back&mdash;but it was difficult to keep things
from slipping out when you were being questioned by women who could
bore holes in stone with a look when they wanted. Well, she
supposed she should be glad they had managed to hang on to what
they had. Once <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> had been mentioned, and that
they had entered it, a mouse would have treed cats before these
women stopped asking questions.</p>

<p>Leane took a half-step forward, not looking at Siuan.
&ldquo;The <em>important</em> thing is that with these <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> you can talk to Egwene, and through her to
Moiraine. Between them, you can not only keep an eye on Rand
al&rsquo;Thor, you should be able to influence him even in Cairhien.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where he went from the Aiel Waste,&rdquo; Siuan said,
&ldquo;where I predicted he would be.&rdquo; If her eyes and words were
directed at the Aes Sedai, her astringent tone was plainly meant
for Leane, who grunted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much good that did. Two Aes Sedai sent off to the
Waste chasing ducks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh, yes, there was very definitely a chill there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough, children,&rdquo; Anaiya said, very much as if they
really were children and she a mother used to their petty
squabbles. She eyed the other Aes Sedai meaningfully. &ldquo;It will be a
very good thing to be able to talk with Egwene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If these work as claimed,&rdquo; Morvrin said, bouncing
the ring on one palm and fingering the other <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>
on her lap. The woman would not believe the sky was blue without
proof.</p>

<p>Sheriam nodded. &ldquo;Yes. That will be your first duty,
Elayne, Nynaeve. You will have a chance to teach Aes Sedai, showing
us how to use them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve curtsied, baring her teeth; they could take
it for a smile if they chose. Teach them? Yes, and never get near
the ring, or the others, again after. Elayne&rsquo;s curtsy was even
stiffer, her face a cool mask. Her eyes rolled toward that fool
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em> almost longingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The letters-of-rights will be useful,&rdquo; Carlinya
said. With all that White Ajah coolness and logic, testiness still
showed in the way she clipped her words. &ldquo;Gareth Bryne always wants
more gold than we have, but with those, we may almost be able to
satisfy him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Sheriam said. &ldquo;And we must take most of the
coin, too. There are more mouths to feed and more backs to clothe
every day, here and elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne gave a gracious nod, just as if they would not
take the money whatever she said, but Nynaeve simply waited. Gold
and letters-of-rights and even <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> were only a
part.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the rest,&rdquo; Sheriam went on, &ldquo;we are agreed that
you left the Tower by command, however erroneous it was, and you
cannot be held to account for it. Now that you are safely back with
us, you will resume your studies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve only breathed out slowly. It was no more than
she had expected since the questioning began. Not that she liked
it, but for once no one was going to be able to accuse her of
having a temper. Not when in all probability it would do no
good.</p>

<p>Elayne, though, burst out with a sharp, &ldquo;But&mdash;!&rdquo;
Just that, before Sheriam cut in just as sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will resume your studies. You are both very
strong, but you are not Aes Sedai yet.&rdquo; Those green eyes held them
until she was sure they had taken it, and then she spoke again, her
voice milder. Milder, but still firm. &ldquo;You are returned to us, and
if Salidar is not the White Tower, you may still consider it so.
From what you have told us in the last hour, there is considerably
more you have yet to tell.&rdquo; Nynaeve&rsquo;s breath caught, but Sheriam&rsquo;s
eyes slid back to the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>. &ldquo;A pity you did not bring the
Seanchan woman with you. That, you really should have done.&rdquo; For
some reason, Elayne blushed bright red, and looked angry at the
same time. For herself, Nynaeve was only relieved it was the
Seanchan the woman meant. &ldquo;But Accepted cannot be called to account
for not thinking as Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Sheriam went on. &ldquo;Siuan and Leane
will have many questions for you. You will cooperate with them, and
answer to the best of your abilities. I trust I do not have to
remind you not to take advantage of their present condition. Some
Accepted, and even some novices, have thought to lay blame for
events, and even take punishments into their own hands.&rdquo; That mild
tone became cold steel. &ldquo;Those young women are now extremely sorry
for themselves. Need I say more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve was no more hasty than Elayne to let her know
she did not, which was to say they both almost stammered in their
haste to get it out. Nynaeve had not thought of assigning blame&mdash;to her thinking, Aes Sedai were all to blame&mdash;but she
did not want Sheriam angry with her. Realizing that fact drove the
truth home bitterly; the days of freedom certainly were gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. Now you may take the jewels the Panarch gave
you, and the arrow&mdash;when there is time, you must tell me why
she made you a gift like that&mdash;and go. One of the other
Accepted will find you places to sleep. Proper dresses may be
harder to come by, but they will be found. I expect you to put your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;adventures&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;behind you, and fit smoothly back into your
proper place.&rdquo; Plain although unspoken was the promise that if they
did not fit back in smoothly, they would be smoothed until they
did. Sheriam gave a satisfied nod when she saw they understood.</p>

<p>Beonin had not said a word since the shield of <em>
saidar</em> was lowered, but as Nynaeve and Elayne made their
curtsies, the Gray sister rose and strode to the table where their
things were laid out. &ldquo;And what of this?&rdquo; she demanded in heavy
Taraboner accents, whipping aside the white cloth that covered the
seal on the Dark One&rsquo;s prison. For a change, her large blue-gray
eyes looked more angry than startled. &ldquo;Are there to be no more
questions about this? Do you all mean to ignore it?&rdquo; The
black-and-white disc lay there, next to the washleather purse, in a
dozen or more pieces, fitted back together as neatly as they could
be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was whole when we put it in the purse.&rdquo; Nynaeve
paused to work moisture back into her mouth. As much as her eyes
had avoided the covering cloth before, they could not leave the
seal now. Leane had smirked when she saw the red dress unwrapped
from around its cargo, and said&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;No, she would not run away
from it, even in her head! &ldquo;Why should we have thought to take
special care? It&rsquo;s <em>cuendillar</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t look at it,&rdquo; Elayne said breathlessly, &ldquo;or
touch it more than we had to. It felt filthy, evil.&rdquo; It no longer
did. Carlinya had made them each hold a piece, demanding to know
what evil feeling they were talking about.</p>

<p>They had said the same things before, more than once,
and no one paid them any heed now.</p>

<p>Sheriam rose and went to stand beside the
honey-haired Gray. &ldquo;We are ignoring nothing, Beonin. Asking these
girls more questions will do no good. They have told us what they
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More questions are always good,&rdquo; Morvrin said, but
she had stopped fiddling with the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> to stare at
the broken seal as hard as anyone else. It might be <em>
cuendillar</em>&mdash;she and Beonin had each tested it and said
it was&mdash;yet she had broken one fragment with her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many of the seven still hold?&rdquo; Myrelle asked
softly, as if speaking to herself. &ldquo;How long until the Dark One
breaks free, and the Last Battle comes?&rdquo; Every Aes Sedai did some
of almost everything, according to her talents and inclinations,
yet each Ajah had its own reason for being. Greens&mdash;who
called themselves the Battle Ajah&mdash;held themselves ready to
face new Dreadlords in the Last Battle. There was almost a hint of
eagerness in Myrelle&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three,&rdquo; Anaiya said unsteadily. &ldquo;Three still hold.
If we know everything. Let us pray that we do. Let us pray three
are enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us pray those three are stronger than this one,&rdquo;
Morvrin muttered. &ldquo;<em>Cuendillar</em> cannot be broken so, not and
be <em>cuendillar</em>. It cannot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will discuss this in due course,&rdquo; Sheriam said.
&ldquo;After more immediate matters that we can do something about.&rdquo;
Taking the cloth from Beonin, she covered the broken seal once
more. &ldquo;Siuan, Leane, we have reached a decision concerning&mdash;&rdquo;
She stopped short as she turned and saw Elayne and Nynaeve. &ldquo;Were
you not told to go?&rdquo; For all her outward calm, the turmoil inside
showed in her forgetting their presence.</p>

<p>Nynaeve was more than ready to drop another curtsy,
blurt a hurried &ldquo;By your leave, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; and scurry for the
door. Without moving a muscle, the Aes Sedai&mdash;and Siuan and
Leane&mdash;watched her and Elayne go. Nynaeve felt their eyes
like a shove. Elayne stepped not a whit more slowly, for all she
cast another look at the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>.</p>

<p>Once Nynaeve had the door closed and could lean back
against its unpainted wood, clutching the gilded coffer to her
breasts, she took her first comfortable breath, or so it seemed,
since entering the old stone inn. She did not want to think about
the broken seal. Another broken seal. She would not. Those women
could shear sheep with their eyes. She could almost look forward to
watching their first meeting with the Wise Ones, if she was not
likely to be squarely in the middle. It had been more than
difficult when she first went to the Tower, learning to do as she
was told by others, to bend her neck. After long months when she
gave the orders&mdash;well, once she had consulted Elayne, usually&mdash;she did not know how she was going to learn to pull wool and
scratch gravel all over again.</p>

<p>The common room, with its ill-patched plaster ceiling
and cold stone fireplaces near collapsing, was the same beehive it
had been when she first entered. No one gave her more than a glance
now, and she gave them less. A small crowd awaited her and
Elayne.</p>

<p>Thom and Juilin, on a rough bench against the flaking
plaster wall, had their heads together with Uno, who was squatting
in front of them, long sword hilt rising over his shoulder. Areina
and Nicola, both staring amazed at everything and trying not to
show it, occupied another bench with Marigan, who was watching
Birgitte attempt to amuse Jan and Seve by awkwardly juggling three
of Thom&rsquo;s colored wooden balls. Kneeling behind the boys, Min was
tickling them, whispering in their ears, but they only clung to
each other, silently staring with those too-big eyes.</p>

<p>Only two others in the entire room were not scurrying
about. Two of Myrelle&rsquo;s three Warders happened to be leaning
against the wall in conversation a few paces beyond the benches,
just this side of the door back to the kitchen corridor. Croi
Makin, a yellow-haired young splinter of stone from Andor with a
fine profile, and Avar Hachami, hawk-nosed and square-chinned with
a thick gray-streaked mustache like down-curved horns. No one would
call Hachami handsome even before his dark-eyed stare made them
swallow. They were not looking at Uno or Thom or anyone else, of
course. It was only happenstance that they alone had nothing to do
and had chosen just that spot to do it. Of course.</p>

<p>Birgitte dropped one of the balls when she saw
Nynaeve and Elayne. &ldquo;What did you tell them?&rdquo; she asked quietly,
barely glancing at the silver arrow in Elayne&rsquo;s hand. The quiver
hung at her belt, but her bow was propped against the wall.</p>

<p>Moving closer, Nynaeve carefully did not look toward
Makin and Hachami. Just as carefully she lowered her voice and was
sparing with emphasis. &ldquo;We told them everything they asked
for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne touched Birgitte&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;They know you are a
good friend who has helped us. You are welcome to stay here, just
the same as Areina and Nicola and Marigan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only when some of Birgitte&rsquo;s tension melted did
Nynaeve realize how much had been there. The blue-eyed woman
scooped up the fallen yellow ball, and smoothly tossed all three
back to Thom, who snagged them with one hand and made them vanish
in a single motion. She wore the faintest of relieved grins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how glad I am to see the pair of
you,&rdquo; Min said for at least the fourth or fifth time. Her hair was
longer than it had been, though still a dark cap around her head,
and she looked different in some other way that Nynaeve could not
put a finger on. Surprisingly, freshly embroidered flowers climbed
the lapels of her coat; she had always worn quite plain clothes
before. &ldquo;A friendly face is rare around here.&rdquo; Her eyes flickered
just a fraction toward the two Warders. &ldquo;We have to settle down
alone and have a long talk. I can&rsquo;t wait to hear what you&rsquo;ve been
up to since you left Tar Valon.&rdquo; Or to tell what she had been up to
as well, else Nynaeve missed her guess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like very much to talk to you, too,&rdquo; Elayne
said, quite seriously. Min looked at her, then sighed and nodded,
not as eager as a moment before.</p>

<p>Thom and Juilin and Uno came up behind Birgitte and
Min, their faces set in that way men took on when they meant to say
things they thought a woman might not like to hear. Before they
could open their mouths, though, a curly-haired woman in an
Accepted&rsquo;s dress pushed between Juilin and Uno, glowering at them,
and planted herself in front of Nynaeve.</p>

<p>Faolain&rsquo;s dress, with its seven bands of color at the
hem for the Ajahs, was not quite as white as it should have been,
and her dark face wore a scowl. &ldquo;I am surprised to see you here,
wilder. I thought you had gone running back to your village, and
our fine Daughter-Heir to her mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you still souring milk for a hobby, Faolain?&rdquo;
Elayne asked.</p>

<p>Nynaeve kept her face pleasant. Just barely. Twice in
the Tower Faolain had been set to teach her something. To put her
in her place, was her own opinion. Even when teacher and pupil were
both Accepted, the teacher had the status of Aes Sedai so long as
the lesson lasted, and Faolain took full advantage. The
curly-haired woman had spent eight years as a novice and five more
as Accepted; she was not best pleased that Nynaeve had never had to
be a novice at all, or that Elayne had worn pure white for less
than a year. Two lessons from Faolain, and two trips to Sheriam&rsquo;s
study for Nynaeve, for stubbornness, temper, a list as long as her
arm. She made her voice light. &ldquo;I heard Siuan and Leane have been
badly treated by someone. I think Sheriam means to make an example
to end it once and for all.&rdquo; She kept her eyes steady on the other
woman&rsquo;s, and Faolain&rsquo;s widened in alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done nothing since Sheriam&mdash;&rdquo; Faolain&rsquo;s
mouth snapped shut, and her face colored heavily. Min hid her mouth
behind her hand, and Faolain jerked her head around, studying the
other women, from Birgitte to Marigan. She motioned brusquely to
Nicola and Areina. &ldquo;You two will do, I suppose. Come with me. Now.
No dawdling.&rdquo; They rose slowly, Areina staring warily and Nicola
with fingers fretting at the waist of her dress.</p>

<p>Elayne stepped between them and Faolain before
Nynaeve could, chin high and eyes imperious blue ice. &ldquo;What do you
want with them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am obeying Sheriam Sedai&rsquo;s orders,&rdquo; Faolain
replied. &ldquo;I myself think they are too old for first testing, but I
obey orders. A sister accompanies Lord Bryne&rsquo;s recruiting parties,
testing women even as old as Nynaeve.&rdquo; Her sudden smile could have
come from a viper. &ldquo;Shall I inform Sheriam Sedai that you
disapprove, Elayne? Shall I tell her you won&rsquo;t let your <em>
retainers</em> be tested?&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s chin came down somewhat during
that, but of course she could not simply back down. She needed a
diversion.</p>

<p>Nynaeve touched Faolain&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Have they found
many?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of herself, the woman&rsquo;s head turned, and
when she glanced back, Elayne was soothing Areina and Nicola,
explaining that they would not be hurt, or forced into anything.
Nynaeve would not have gone so far. When Aes Sedai found someone
with the spark born in her like Elayne or Egwene, someone who would
channel eventually whether she wanted to or not, they were quite
open about bundling her into training whatever her wishes. They
seemed more lenient about those who could be trained but would
never touch <em>saidar</em> without it, and about wilders, those
who had survived the one-in-four chance of teaching themselves,
usually without knowing what they had done and often blocked in
some way, as Nynaeve was. Supposedly they could choose to come or
stay. Nynaeve had chosen to enter the Tower, but she suspected that
if she had not, she still would have gone, perhaps even tied hand
and foot. Aes Sedai gave women who had the smallest chance of
joining them as much choice as a lamb on a feastday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three,&rdquo; Faolain said after a moment. &ldquo;All that
effort, and they&rsquo;ve found three. One a wilder.&rdquo; She truly did not
like wilders. &ldquo;I do not know why they are so eager to find new
novices. The novices we have can&rsquo;t be raised Accepted until we
regain the Tower. It is all Siuan Sanche&rsquo;s fault, her and Leane.&rdquo; A
muscle in her cheek twitched, as if she realized that remark might
be thought to harass the former Amyrlin and Keeper, and she seized
Areina and Nicola each by an arm. &ldquo;Come along. I obey orders, and
if you&rsquo;re to be tested, you&rsquo;ll be tested, waste of time or no waste
of time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A nasty woman,&rdquo; Min murmured, squinting after
Faolain as she hurried the other across the common room. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
think, if there was any justice, she would have an unpleasant
future ahead of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve wanted to ask what Min had seen in her
viewing of the curly-haired Accepted&mdash;there were a hundred
questions she wanted to ask her&mdash;but Thom and the other two
men planted themselves firmly in front of her and Elayne, Juilin
and Uno to either side so among the three they could see in every
direction. Birgitte was leading Jaril and Seve to their mother,
keeping her out of it. Min knew what the men were up to, too, by
the rueful look she gave them; she seemed about to say something,
but in the end she only shrugged and joined Birgitte.</p>

<p>By Thom&rsquo;s face, he could have been about to comment
on the weather, or ask what was for supper. Nothing important.
&ldquo;This place is full of dangerous fools and dreamers. They think
they can depose Elaida. That&rsquo;s why Gareth Bryne is here. To raise
an army for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juilin&rsquo;s grin almost split his dark face in two. &ldquo;Not
fools. Madwomen. And madmen. I don&rsquo;t care if Elaida was there the
day Logain was born. They&rsquo;re mad to think they can pull down an
Amyrlin sitting in the White Tower from here. We could reach
Cairhien in a month, maybe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ragan and a few of the others already have horses
marked out for borrowing.&rdquo; Uno was grinning, too; it looked
incredibly incongruous with that glaring red eye on his patch. &ldquo;The
guards are set to watch for people coming in, not going out. We can
lose them in the forest. It&rsquo;ll be dark soon. They&rsquo;ll never find
us.&rdquo; The women&rsquo;s donning their Great Serpent rings back by the
river had had a remarkable effect on his language. Though he did
seem to make up for it when he thought they could not hear.</p>

<p>Nynaeve looked at Elayne, who shook her head
slightly. Elayne would put up with anything to be Aes Sedai. And
herself? Small chance that they could influence these Aes Sedai to
support Rand if they had decided to try controlling him instead.
Make that no chance; she might as well be realistic. And yet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;And yet there was Healing. She would learn nothing of it in
Cairhien, but here&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Not ten paces from her, Therva Maresis, a
slender Yellow with a long nose, was methodically ticking off
points on a parchment with her pen. A baldheaded Warder with a
black beard stood conferring with Nisao Dachen near the door, head
and shoulders above her despite being no taller than average, while
Dagdara Finchey, as wide as any man in the room and taller than
most, addressed a group of novices in front of one of the unlit
fireplaces, briskly sending them off one by one on errands. Nisao
and Dagdara were Yellow Ajah, too; it was said that Dagdara, her
graying hair marking considerable age on an Aes Sedai, knew more of
Healing than any two others. It was not as if Nynaeve would be able
to do anything useful if she did go to Rand. Just watch him go mad.
If she could progress with Healing, maybe she could find a way to
hold that madness off. There was too much that Aes Sedai were
willing to call hopeless and let go at that to suit her.</p>

<p>All of that flashed through her head in the time it
took to look at Elayne and turn back to the men. &ldquo;We will be
staying here. Uno, if you and the others want to go to Rand, you
are free to, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. I fear I no longer have money
to help you.&rdquo; The gold the Aes Sedai had taken was needed just as
they said, but she could not help wincing at the few silvers left
in her purse. These men had followed her&mdash;and Elayne, of
course&mdash;for all the wrong reasons, but that did not lessen
her responsibility for them. Their loyalties were to Rand; they had
no reason to enter a struggle for the White Tower. With a glance at
the gilded coffer, she added reluctantly, &ldquo;But I do have some
things you can sell along the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must go too, Thom,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;And you,
Juilin. There&rsquo;s no point in remaining. We have no need of you now,
but Rand will.&rdquo; She tried to press her casket of jewels into Thom&rsquo;s
hands, but he refused to take it.</p>

<p>The three men exchanged looks in that irritating way
they had, Uno going so far as to roll his eye. Nynaeve thought she
heard Juilin mutter something under his breath about having said
they would be stubborn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps in a few days,&rdquo; Thom said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few days,&rdquo; Juilin agreed.</p>

<p>Uno nodded. &ldquo;I could do with a little rest if I&rsquo;m
going to be running from Warders halfway to Cairhien.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave them her flattest stare and deliberately
tugged her braid. Elayne had her chin as high as it had ever been,
her blue eyes haughty enough to chip ice. Thom and the others
surely knew the signs by now; their nonsense was not going to be
allowed. &ldquo;If you think you are still following Rand al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s
orders to look after us&mdash;&rdquo; Elayne began in frosty tones at the
same time that Nynaeve said heatedly, &ldquo;You promised to do as you
were told, and I mean to see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing like that,&rdquo; Thom broke in, brushing back a
strand of Elayne&rsquo;s hair with a gnarled finger. &ldquo;Nothing at all
like. Can&rsquo;t an old man with a limp want a little rest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To tell the truth,&rdquo; Juilin said, &ldquo;I am just staying
because Thom owes me money. Dice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you expect us to steal twenty horses from Warders
like falling out of bed?&rdquo; Uno growled. He seemed to have forgotten
just offering to do exactly that.</p>

<p>Elayne stared, at a loss for words, and Nynaeve was
having difficulty finding them herself. How far they had fallen.
Not so much as a shifted foot in the three of them. The trouble was
that she was torn. She had determined to send them away. She had,
and not because she didn&rsquo;t want them around watching her curtsy and
scrape right and left. Not at all. Yet with almost nothing in
Salidar as she had expected, she had to admit, however reluctantly,
that it would be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;comforting&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to know she and Elayne had
more than Birgitte to depend on. Not that she would take up the
offer of escape, of course&mdash;if that was what it should be
called&mdash;not under any circumstances. Their presence would
just be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;comforting. Certainly not that she would let them
know that. She would not have to, since they were going, whatever
they thought. Rand <em>could</em> find use for them, very probably,
and they would only get in the way here. Except&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The unpainted door opened, and Siuan stalked out,
followed by Leane. They stared at each other coldly before Leane
sniffed and glided away, startlingly sinuous as she vanished around
Croi and Avar into the corridor that led to the kitchens. Nynaeve
frowned slightly. In the midst of all that iciness there had been
one instant, a brief flicker she almost missed with it right in
front of her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Siuan swung toward her, then abruptly stopped short,
her face going blank. Someone else had joined the small
gathering.</p>

<p>Gareth Bryne, dented breastplate buckled over his
plain buff-colored coat and steel-backed gauntlets tucked behind
his sword belt, radiated command. Mostly gray hair and a bluff face
gave him the appearance of a man who had seen everything, endured
everything; a man who could endure anything.</p>

<p>Elayne smiled, nodding graciously. A far cry from her
astonished stares, coming into Salidar, when she had first
recognized him at the length of the street. &ldquo;I will not say it is
entirely good to see you, Lord Gareth. I have heard of some
difficulty between Mother and you, but I am sure it can be mended.
You know Mother is hasty sometimes. She will come &rsquo;round, and ask
you back to your proper place in Caemlyn, you may be certain of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done is done, Elayne.&rdquo; Ignoring her astonishment&mdash;Nynaeve doubted anyone who knew Elayne&rsquo;s rank had ever been
so curt to her&mdash;he turned to Uno. &ldquo;Have you thought on what I
said? Shienarans are the finest heavy cavalry in the world, and I
have lads who are just right for proper training.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uno frowned, his one eye sliding to Elayne and
Nynaeve. Slowly, he nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing better to do. I&rsquo;ll ask
the others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bryne clapped him on the shoulder. &ldquo;Well enough. And
you, Thom Merrilin.&rdquo; Thom had half turned away at the other man&rsquo;s
approach, knuckling his mustaches and staring at the floor as if to
obscure his face. Now he met Bryne&rsquo;s level stare with one of his
own. &ldquo;I once knew a fellow with a name much like yours,&rdquo; Bryne
said. &ldquo;A skilled player of a certain game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I once knew a fellow who looked much like you,&rdquo; Thom
replied. &ldquo;He tried hard to put me in chains. I think he&rsquo;d have cut
my head off if he ever laid hands on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A long time ago, that would be? Men do strange
things for women sometimes.&rdquo; Bryne glanced at Siuan and shook his
head. &ldquo;Will you join me for a game of stones, Master Merrilin? I
sometimes find myself wishing for a man who knows the game well,
the way it&rsquo;s played in lofty circles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thom&rsquo;s bushy white eyebrows drew down almost as far
as Uno&rsquo;s had, but he never took his eyes from Bryne. &ldquo;I might play
a game or two,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;once I know the stakes. As long
as you understand I don&rsquo;t intend to spend the rest of my life
playing stones with you. I don&rsquo;t like staying too long in one place
anymore. My feet itch, sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So long as they don&rsquo;t itch in the middle of a
crucial game,&rdquo; Bryne told him dryly. &ldquo;The two of you come with me.
And don&rsquo;t expect much sleep. Around here, everything needs doing
yesterday, except what should have been done last week.&rdquo; Pausing,
he looked at Siuan again. &ldquo;My shirts came back only half clean
today.&rdquo; With that he was leading Thom and Uno off. Siuan glared at
his back, then shifted her frown to Min, and Min grimaced and
darted off the way Leane had gone.</p>

<p>Nynaeve did not understand that last exchange at all.
And the nerve of those men, thinking they could talk over her head&mdash;or under her nose, or whatever&mdash;without her
understanding every word. Enough of them, anyway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good thing he has no need for a thief-catcher,&rdquo;
Juilin said, eyeing Siuan sideways, and plainly uncomfortable. He
had not gotten over the shock of learning her name; Nynaeve was not
sure he had taken in about her being stilled, and no longer the
Amyrlin Seat. He certainly shifted his feet for <em>her</em>. &ldquo;This
way I can sit and talk. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of fellows who look like
they might unwind over a mug of ale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He practically ignored me,&rdquo; Elayne said
incredulously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what the trouble is between him and
Mother, he has no right&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, I will tend to Lord Gareth
Bryne later. I have to talk to Min, Nynaeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve started to follow as Elayne hurried toward
that hall to the kitchens&mdash;Min would give straight answers&mdash;but Siuan caught her arm in an iron grip.</p>

<p>The Siuan Sanche who had meekly ducked her head
before those Aes Sedai was gone. No one here wore the shawl. Her
voice never rose; it did not need to. She fixed Juilin with a stare
that had him almost jumping out of his skin. &ldquo;You watch what
questions you ask, thief-catcher, or you&rsquo;ll gut yourself for
market.&rdquo; Those cold blue eyes shifted to Birgitte and Marigan.
Marigan&rsquo;s mouth twisted as if she tasted something bad, and even
Birgitte blinked. &ldquo;You two find an Accepted named Theodrin and ask
her about somewhere to sleep tonight. Those children look as if
they should be in bed already. Well? Move your feet!&rdquo; Before they
had stirred a step&mdash;and Birgitte was moving as quickly as
Marigan, maybe quicker&mdash;she rounded on Nynaeve. &ldquo;You I have
questions for. You were told to cooperate, and I suggest you do if
you know what&rsquo;s good for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was like being caught in a high wind. Before
Nynaeve knew it, Siuan was hurrying her up rickety steps with a
railing cobbled together from unpainted wood, hustling her down a
rough-floored corridor to a tiny room with two cramped beds built
into the wall, one above the other. Siuan took the only stool,
motioning her to sit on the lower bed. Nynaeve chose to stand, if
only to show she was not going to be pushed. There was not much
else in the room. A washstand with a brick propping up one leg held
a chipped pitcher and basin. A few dresses hung from pegs, and what
appeared to be a pallet lay rolled up in one corner. Nynaeve had
fallen far in the space of a day, but Siuan had fallen farther than
she could imagine. She did not think she would have too much
trouble with the woman. Even if Siuan did still have the same
eyes.</p>

<p>Siuan sniffed. &ldquo;Suit yourself, then, girl. The ring.
It doesn&rsquo;t require channeling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. You heard me tell Sheriam&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyone can use it? A woman who can&rsquo;t channel? A
man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly a man.&rdquo; <em>Ter&rsquo;angreal</em> that did not
need the Power usually worked for men or women. &ldquo;For any woman,
yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are going to teach me to use it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve raised one eyebrow. This might be a lever to
get what she wanted. If not, she had another. Maybe. &ldquo;Do they know
about this? All the talk was of showing them how it works. You were
never mentioned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Siuan did not appear shaken at
all. She even smiled, and not pleasantly. &ldquo;And they won&rsquo;t. Else
they&rsquo;ll learn you and Elayne have been posing as full sisters since
you left Tar Valon. Moiraine might be letting Egwene get away with
it&mdash;if she hasn&rsquo;t tried it, too, I don&rsquo;t know a bar knot from
a running hitch&mdash;but Sheriam, Carlinya&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? They&rsquo;ll have
you squealing like a spawning grunter before they&rsquo;re done. Long
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ridiculous.&rdquo; Nynaeve realized she was sitting
on the edge of the bed. She did not remember sitting down. Thom and
Juilin would hold their tongues. No one else knew. She had to talk
to Elayne. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t pretended anything of the sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie to me, girl. If I needed confirmation,
your eyes gave it. Your stomach is turning somersaults, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It most certainly was. &ldquo;Of course not. If I teach you
anything, it&rsquo;s because I want to.&rdquo; She was not going to let this
woman bully her. The last vestige of pity winked out. &ldquo;<em>If</em>
I do, I want something in return. To study you and Leane. I want to
know if stilling can be Healed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Siuan said flatly. &ldquo;Now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything short of death should be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Should be&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;is,&rsquo; girl. Leane and I were
promised we would be left alone. Speak to Faolain or Emara if you
want to know what happens to anyone who molests us. They weren&rsquo;t
the first or the worst, but they cried the longest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her other lever. Near panic had driven it right out
of her head. If it existed. One glance. &ldquo;What would Sheriam say if
she knew you and Leane weren&rsquo;t ready to tear out each other&rsquo;s hair
at all?&rdquo; Siuan just looked at her. &ldquo;They think you&rsquo;re tamed, don&rsquo;t
they? The more you snap at anybody who can&rsquo;t snap back, the more
they take it for proof when you leap to obey every time an Aes
Sedai coughs. Was a little cringing all it took to make them forget
the two of you had worked hand-in-hand for years? Or did you
convince them stilling had changed everything about you, not just
your face? When they find out you&rsquo;ve been scheming behind their
backs, manipulating them, you&rsquo;ll howl louder than any grunter.
Whatever <em>that</em> is.&rdquo; Not so much as a blink. Siuan was not
going to loose her temper and let any admissions slip out. Yet
there had been something in that brief look; Nynaeve was sure of
it. &ldquo;I want to study you&mdash;and Leane&mdash;whenever I want.
And Logain.&rdquo; Perhaps she could learn something there as well. Men
were different; it would be like looking at the problem from
another angle. Not that she would Heal him even if she discovered
how. Rand&rsquo;s channeling was necessary. She was not about to loose
another man on the world who could wield the Power. &ldquo;If not, then
you can forget about the ring, and <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.&rdquo; What
was Siuan after there? Probably just to revisit something that at
least seemed like being Aes Sedai. Nynaeve stamped firmly on
momentarily rekindled pity. &ldquo;And if you make any claims about us
pretending to be Aes Sedai, then I&rsquo;ll have no choice but to tell
about you and Leane. Elayne and I might be uncomfortable until the
truth comes out, but it will, and the truth will make you weep as
long as Faolain and Emara together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence stretched. How did the other woman manage to
look so cool? Nynaeve had always thought it had to do with being
Aes Sedai. Her lips felt dry, the only part of her that did. If she
was wrong, if Siuan was willing to put it to the test, she knew who
would be weeping.</p>

<p>Finally, Siuan muttered, &ldquo;I hope Moiraine has managed
to keep Egwene&rsquo;s backbone more supple than this.&rdquo; Nynaeve did not
understand, but she hardly had time to consider it. The next
instant, the other woman was leaning forward, hand outstretched.
&ldquo;You keep my secrets, and I will keep yours. Teach me the ring, and
you can study stilling and gentling to your heart&rsquo;s content.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve barely managed to hold in a relieved sigh as
she clasped the offered hand. She had done it. For the first time
in what seemed forever, someone had tried to bully her and failed.
She almost felt ready to face Moghedien. Almost.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Elayne caught up with Min just outside the back door
of the inn and fell in beside her. Min had what looked like two or
three white shirts wadded under one arm. The sun sat on the
treetops, and in the fading light the stableyard had the soft look
of dirt not long turned, with a huge stump that might have belonged
to an oak right in the middle. The thatch-roofed stone stable had
no doors, allowing a good look at men moving among filled stalls.
Surprisingly, Leane was talking to a large man on the edge of the
stable&rsquo;s shadow. Roughly dressed, he looked a blacksmith, or a
brawler. What was surprising was how close Leane stood, head tilted
as she stared up at him. And then she actually patted his cheek
before turning away and hurrying back into the inn. The big man
stared after her a moment, then melted into the shadows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me what she&rsquo;s up to,&rdquo; Min said. &ldquo;Strange
people come to see Siuan or her, and some of the men, she&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, you saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne did not really care what Leane did. But now
that she had Min alone, she did not know how to bring up what she
wanted. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laundry,&rdquo; Min muttered, shifting the shirts
irritably. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how good it is to see Siuan the mouse
for once. She doesn&rsquo;t know whether the eagle is going to eat her or
make her a pet, but she has the same choice she gives everybody
else. None!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne quickened her pace to keep up as they crossed
the stableyard. Whatever that was about, it gave no opening. &ldquo;Did
you know what Thom was going to suggest? We are staying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told them you would. Not a viewing.&rdquo; Min&rsquo;s step
slowed again as they started between the stable and a crumbling
stone wall, down a dim alley of brush stubble and trampled weeds.
&ldquo;I just didn&rsquo;t think you would give up the chance to study again.
You were always eager. Nynaeve, too, even if she won&rsquo;t admit it. I
wish I&rsquo;d been wrong. I&rsquo;d go with you. At least, I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She
muttered something furious-sounding under her breath. &ldquo;Those three
you brought with you are trouble, and that <em>is</em> a
viewing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There it was. The crack she needed. But instead of
asking what she had intended, she said, &ldquo;You mean Marigan and
Nicola and Areina? How can they be trouble?&rdquo; Only a fool passed
over what Min saw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly. I only caught glimpses of
aura, and just out of the corner of my eye. Never when I was
looking right at them, where I might have made something out. There
aren&rsquo;t many who have auras all the time, you know. Trouble. Maybe
they&rsquo;ll carry tales. Were you up to anything you wouldn&rsquo;t want the
Aes Sedai to know about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; Elayne said briskly. Min looked at
her sideways, and she added, &ldquo;Well, nothing we didn&rsquo;t have to do.
They can&rsquo;t possibly know about it anyway.&rdquo; This was not taking her
where she wanted to go. Drawing a deep breath, she leaped off the
cliff. &ldquo;Min, you had a viewing about Rand and me, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; She
went two steps before she realized the other woman had stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; It was a wary word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You saw that we were going to fall in love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly. I saw you&rsquo;d fall in love with him. I
don&rsquo;t know what he feels for you, only that he&rsquo;s tied to you some
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s mouth tightened. That was about what she had
expected, but not what she wanted to hear. <em>&ldquo;Wish&rdquo; and &ldquo;want&rdquo;
trip the feet, but &ldquo;is&rdquo; makes the path smoother</em>. That was what
Lini said. You had to deal with what was, not what you wished was.
&ldquo;And you saw there would be someone else. Someone I&rsquo;d have to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;share him with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two,&rdquo; Min said hoarsely. &ldquo;Two others. And&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;And
I&rsquo;m one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mouth already open for the next question, for a
moment Elayne could only stare. &ldquo;You?&rdquo; she got out at last.</p>

<p>Min bristled. &ldquo;Yes, me! Do you think I can&rsquo;t fall in
love? I didn&rsquo;t want to, but I did, and that&rsquo;s that.&rdquo; She stalked
past Elayne down the alleyway, and this time Elayne was slower to
catch up.</p>

<p>It certainly explained a few things. How nervously
Min had always sidestepped talking about it. The embroidery on her
lapels. And unless she was imagining it, Min was wearing rouge,
too. <em>How do I feel about it?</em> she wondered. She could not
sort it out. &ldquo;Who is the third?&rdquo; she asked quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Min mumbled. &ldquo;Only that she has a
temper. Not Nynaeve, thank the Light.&rdquo; She gave a weak laugh. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think I could have survived that.&rdquo; Once more she gave Elayne
a cautious sidelong look. &ldquo;What does this mean between you and me?
I like you. I never had a sister, but sometimes I feel like you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I want to be your friend, Elayne, and I won&rsquo;t stop liking you
whatever happens, but I can&rsquo;t stop loving him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t very much like the idea of having to share a
man,&rdquo; Elayne said stiffly. That was certainly an
understatement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, neither. Only&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Elayne, it shames me to
admit it, but I will take him any way I can get him. Not that
either of us has much choice. Light, he&rsquo;s scrambled my whole life.
Just thinking about him scrambles my brains.&rdquo; Min sounded as if she
did not know whether to laugh or cry.</p>

<p>Elayne exhaled slowly. Not Min&rsquo;s fault. Was it better
that it was Min rather than, say, Berelain or somebody else she
could not abide? &ldquo;<em>Ta&rsquo;veren</em>,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He bends the world
around him. We are chips caught in a whirlpool. But I seem to
recall you and me and Egwene saying we&rsquo;d never let a man come
between us being friends, We will work it out somehow, Min. And
when we find out who the third is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, we&rsquo;ll work that out,
as well. Somehow.&rdquo; A <em>third!</em> Could <em>she</em> be
Berelain? <em>Oh, blood and ashes!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Somehow,&rdquo; Min said bleakly. &ldquo;Meanwhile, you and I
are caught here in a leg trap. I know there&rsquo;s another, I know I
can&rsquo;t do anything about it, but I had enough trouble reconciling
myself to you, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Cairhienin women aren&rsquo;t all like Moiraine.
I saw a Cairhienin noblewoman in Baerlon once. On the surface, she
made Moiraine look like Leane, but sometimes she said things,
hinting. And her auras! I don&rsquo;t think a man in the whole town was
safe alone with her, not unless he was ugly, lame, and better yet,
dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne sniffed, but she managed to make her voice
light. &ldquo;Never you mind about that. We have another sister, you and
I, one you&rsquo;ve never met. Aviendha is keeping a close eye on Rand,
and he doesn&rsquo;t go ten steps without a guard of Aiel Maidens of the
Spear.&rdquo; A Cairhienin woman? At least she had met Berelain, knew
something of her. No. She was not going to fret over it like some
brainless girl. A grown woman dealt with the world as it was and
made the best of it. Who could it be?</p>

<p>They had come out into an open yard dotted with cold
ashes. Huge kettles, most pitted where rust had been scrubbed away,
stood against the encircling stone wall, which had been toppled in
several places by trees growing up in it. Despite the shadows
crossing the yard, two steaming kettles still sat on flames, and
three novices, hair sweat-soaked and white skirts tied up, were
hard at work on scrub boards stuck into broad wash-pots full of
soapy water.</p>

<p>With a glance at the shirts under Min&rsquo;s arm, Elayne
embraced <em>saidar</em>. &ldquo;Let me help you with those.&rdquo; Channeling
to do assigned chores was forbidden&mdash;physical labor built
character, so they said&mdash;but this could not be counted the
same. If she swirled the shirts around in the water violently
enough, there should be no reason to get their hands wet. &ldquo;Tell me
everything. Are Siuan and Leane as changed as they seem? How did
you get here? Is Logain <em>really</em> here? And why are you
laundering some man&rsquo;s shirts? Everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min laughed, plainly pleased to change the subject.
&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Everything&rsquo; will take a week. But I&rsquo;ll try. First, I helped Siuan
and Leane get out of the dungeon Elaida had stuck them in, and then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Making appropriate sounds of amazement, Elayne
channeled Air to lift one of the boiling kettles clear of its
flames. She hardly noticed the novices&rsquo; incredulous stares; she was
used to her own strength now, and it rarely occurred to her that
she did things, without thinking, that some full Aes Sedai could
not do at all. Who was the third woman? Aviendha had <em>
better</em> be keeping a close eye on him.</p>
