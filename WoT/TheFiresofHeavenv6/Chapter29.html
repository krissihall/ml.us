<h4><em>Memories of Saldaea</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">L</span>ying
on his bed in the dark, in his shirtsleeves,
Kadere idly twirled one of his large kerchiefs between his hands.
The wagon&rsquo;s open windows let in moonlight, but not much breeze. At
least Cairhien was cooler than the Waste. Someday he hoped to
return to Saldaea, to walk in the garden where his sister Teodora
had taught him his first letters and numbers. He missed her as much
as he did Saldaea, the deep winters when trees burst from their sap
freezing and the only way to travel was by snowshoes or skis. In
these southlands, spring felt like summer, and summer like the Pit
of Doom. Sweat rolled out of him in streams.</p>

<p>With a heavy sigh, he pushed his fingers into a small
gap where the bed was built into the wagon. The folded scrap of
parchment rustled. He left it there. He knew the words on it by
heart.</p>

<p class="note">You are not alone among strangers. A way has been
chosen.</p>

<p>Just that, without signature, of course. He had found
it slipped under his door when he retired for the night. There was
a town not a quarter of a mile away, Eianrod, but even if a soft
bed remained empty there, he doubted whether the Aiel would allow
him to spend a night away from the wagons. Or that the Aes Sedai
would. For the moment, his plans fit in well enough with
Moiraine&rsquo;s. Perhaps he would get to see Tar Valon again. A
dangerous place, for his sort, but the work there was always
important, and invigorating.</p>

<p>He put his mind back on the note, though he wished he
could afford to ignore it. The word &ldquo;chosen&rdquo; made him sure it came
from another Darkfriend. The first surprise had been receiving it
now, after crossing most of Cairhien. Nearly two months ago, right
after Jasin Natael attached himself to Rand al&rsquo;Thor&mdash;for
reasons the man had never deigned to explain&mdash;and his new
partner Keille Shaogi had disappeared&mdash;he suspected she was
buried in the Waste, with a thrust from Natael&rsquo;s knife through her
heart, and small riddance&mdash;soon after that, he had been
visited by one of the Chosen. By Lanfear herself. She had given him
his instructions.</p>

<p>Automatically his hand went to his chest, feeling
through his shirt the scars branded there. He mopped his face with
the kerchief. Part of his mind thought coldly, as it had at least
once a day since, that they were an effective way to prove to him
that it had not been an ordinary dream. An ordinary nightmare.
Another part of him almost gibbered with relief that she had not
returned.</p>

<p>The second surprise of the note had been the hand. A
woman&rsquo;s hand, unless he missed his guess by a mile, and some of the
letters formed in what he now knew for an Aiel way. Natael had told
him that there must be Darkfriends among the Aiel&mdash;there were
Darkfriends in every land, among every people&mdash;but he had
never wanted to find brothers in the Waste. Aiel would kill you as
soon as look at you, and you could put a foot wrong with them by
breathing.</p>

<p>Taken all in all, the note spelled disaster. Possibly
Natael had told some Aiel Darkfriend who he was. Angrily twirling
the kerchief to a long thin cord, he snapped it tight between his
hands. If the gleeman and Keille had not had proofs that they stood
high in Darkfriend councils, he would have killed them both before
going near the Waste. The only other possibility made his stomach
leaden. &ldquo;A way has been chosen.&rdquo; Maybe that had only been to put
the word &ldquo;chosen&rdquo; down, and maybe it was meant to tell him that one
of the Chosen had decided to use him. The note had not come from
Lanfear; she would simply have spoken to him in his dreams once
more.</p>

<p>In spite of the heat, he shivered, yet he had to wipe
his face again, too. He had the feeling that Lanfear was a jealous
mistress to serve, but if another of the Chosen wanted him he would
have no choice. Despite all the promises made when he had given his
oaths as a boy, he was a man of few illusions. Caught between two
of the Chosen, he could be flattened like a kitten beneath a wagon
wheel, and they would notice as much as the wagon did. He wished he
were home in Saldaea. He wished he could see Teodora again.</p>

<p>A scraping at the door brought him to his feet; for
all his bulk, he was more agile than he let anyone see. Mopping his
face and neck, he made his way past the brick stove that he
certainly had no need for here, and the cabinets with their
ornately carved and painted uprights. When he pulled the door open,
a slender figure swathed in black robes scurried in past him. He
took one quick look around the moonlit darkness to make certain no
one was watching&mdash;the drivers were all snoring beneath the
other wagons and the Aiel guards never came among the wagons
themselves&mdash;and quickly shut the door again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be hot, Isendre,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;Take off
that robe and make yourself comfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, no,&rdquo; she said bitterly from the shadowed
depths of her cowl. She stood stiffly, but every now and then she
twitched; the wool must be even itchier than usual tonight.</p>

<p>He chuckled again. &ldquo;As you wish.&rdquo; Beneath those
robes, he suspected, the Maidens of the Spear still allowed her to
wear nothing but the stolen jewelry, if that. She had become
prudish in ways since the Maidens had her. Why the woman had been
stupid enough to steal, he could not understand. He had certainly
made no objections when they dragged her screaming from the wagon
by her hair; he was only glad that they had not thought he was
involved. Her greediness had certainly made his task more
difficult. &ldquo;Have you anything to report on al&rsquo;Thor or Natael?&rdquo; A
major part of Lanfear&rsquo;s instruction had been to keep a close eye on
those two, and he knew no better way to keep an eye on a man than
to put a woman in his bed. Any man told his bedmate things he had
vowed to keep secret, boasted of his plans, revealed his
weaknesses, even if he was the Dragon Reborn and this Dawn fellow
the Aiel called him.</p>

<p>She shuddered visibly. &ldquo;At least I can come near
Natael.&rdquo; Come near him? Once the Maidens had caught her sneaking to
the man&rsquo;s tent, they had practically begun stuffing her into it
every night. She always put the best face on matters. &ldquo;Not that he
tells me anything. Wait. Be patient. Keep silent. Make
accommodation with fate, whatever that means. He says that every
time I try to ask a question. For the most part, all he wants to do
is play music I&rsquo;ve never heard before and make love.&rdquo; She never had
anything more to say about the gleeman. For the hundredth time he
wondered why Lanfear wanted Natael watched. The man was supposed to
be as high as a Darkfriend could reach, only a step below the
Chosen themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I take it that means you still have not managed to
wriggle into al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s bed?&rdquo; he asked, brushing past her to sit
down on the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She writhed uncomfortably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you will have to try harder, won&rsquo;t you? I am
growing tired of failure, Isendre, and our masters are not as
patient as I. He&rsquo;s only a man, whatever his titles.&rdquo; She had often
boasted to him that she could have any man she wanted, and make him
do whatever she wanted. She had shown him the truth of her boasts.
She had not needed to steal jewelry; he would have bought her
anything she wanted. He <em>had</em> bought her more than he could
afford. &ldquo;The bloody Maidens can&rsquo;t watch him every second, and once
you are in his bed, he&rsquo;ll not let them harm you.&rdquo; One taste of her
would be enough for that. &ldquo;I have full faith and confidence in your
abilities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; If anything, the word was shorter this
time.</p>

<p>He rolled and unrolled the kerchief irritably. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;No&rsquo;
is not a word our masters like to hear, Isendre.&rdquo; That meant their
lords among the Darkfriends; not all lords or ladies by any means&mdash;a groom might give orders to lady, a beggar to a magistrate&mdash;but their commands were at least as strictly enforced as any
noble&rsquo;s, and usually more so. &ldquo;Not a word our mistress will like to
hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Isendre shuddered. She had not believed his tale
until he showed her the burns on his chest, but since then, one
mention of Lanfear had been enough to quell any rebellion on her
part. This time, she began to weep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot, Hadnan. When we stopped tonight, I thought
I might have a chance in a town instead of tents, but they caught
me before I got within ten paces of him.&rdquo; She pushed back her hood,
and he gaped as moonlight played over her bare scalp. Even her
eyebrows were gone. &ldquo;They shaved me, Hadnan. Adelin and Enaila and
Jolien, they held me down and shaved every hair. They beat me with
with nettles, Hadnan.&rdquo; She shook like sapling in high wind,
sobbing slack-mouthed and mumbling the words. &ldquo;I itch from
shoulders to knees, and burn too much to scratch. They said they&rsquo;d
make me wear nettles, the next time I so much as looked in his
direction. They meant it, Hadnan. They did! They said they&rsquo;d give
me to Aviendha, and they told me what she would do. I cannot,
Hadnan. Not again. I cannot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stunned, he stared at her. She had had such lovely
dark hair. Yet she was beautiful enough that even being bald as an
egg only made her seem exotic. Her tears and sagging face detracted
only a little. If she could put herself into al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s bed for just
one night&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;It was not going to happen. The Maidens had broken
her. He had broken people himself, and he knew the signs. Eagerness
to avoid more punishment became eagerness to obey. The mind never
wanted to admit it was running from something, so she would soon
convince herself that she really wanted to obey, that she really
wanted nothing more than to please the Maidens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does Aviendha have to do with it?&rdquo; he muttered.
How soon before Isendre felt the need to confess her sins, as
well?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Al&rsquo;Thor has been bedding her since Rhuidean, you
fool! She spends every night with him. The Maidens think she will
marry him.&rdquo; Even through her sobs he could detect resentful fury.
She would not like it that another had succeeded where she failed.
Doubtless that was why she had not told him before.</p>

<p>Aviendha was a beautiful woman despite her fierce
eyes, full-breasted compared to most of the Maidens, yet he would
stack Isendre against her if only&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Isendre slumped in the
moonlight coming through the windows, quivering from head to toe,
sobbing openmouthed, tears rolling down her cheeks that she did not
even bother to wipe away. She would grovel on the ground if
Aviendha frowned at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;If you cannot, then you
cannot. You can still pry something out of Natael. I know you can.&rdquo;
Rising, he took her shoulders to turn her toward the door.</p>

<p>She flinched away from his touch, but she did turn.
&ldquo;Natael will not want to look at me for days,&rdquo; she said petulantly
around hiccoughs and sniffs. Sobs threatened to break out again any
moment, but his tone seemed to have soothed her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m red, Hadnan.
As red as if I had laid naked in the sun for a day. And my hair. It
will take forever to grow ba&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she reached for the door, her eyes going to the
handle, he had the kerchief spun to a cord in an instant and around
her neck. He tried to ignore her rasping gurgles, the frantic
scraping of her feet on the floor. Her fingers clawed at his hands,
but he stared straight ahead. Even keeping his eyes open, he saw
Teodora; he always did, when he killed a woman. He had loved his
sister, but she had discovered what he was, and she would not have
kept silent. Isendre&rsquo;s heels drummed violently, but after what
seemed an eternity they slowed, went still, and she became a dead
weight dragging at his hands. He held the cord tight for a count of
sixty before unwinding it and letting her fall. She would have been
confessing, next. Confessing to being a Darkfriend. Pointing a
finger at him.</p>

<p>Rummaging in the cabinets by touch, he pulled out
butchering knife. Disposing of a whole corpse would be difficult,
but luckily the dead did not bleed much; the robe would absorb what
little there was. Maybe he could find the woman who had left the
note under his door. If she was not pretty enough, she must have
friends who were also Darkfriends. Natael would not care if it was
an Aiel woman who visited him&mdash;Kadere would rather have
bedded a viper himself; Aiel were dangerous&mdash;and maybe an
Aiel would have a better chance than Isendre against Aviendha.
Kneeling, he hummed quietly to himself as he worked, a lullaby that
Teodora had taught him.</p>
