<h4><em>The Gift of a Blade</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
camp began to go up quickly, in the mouth of
Jangai Pass, if away from Taien, and spreading over the hills
around the approaches, among the scattered thornbushes, and even
onto the slopes of the mountains. Not that anything was very
visible except what was inside the pass; Aiel tents blended into
the stony soil so well that you could miss them even when you knew
what you were looking for and where. In the hills the Aiel camped
by clan, but those in the pass itself grouped themselves by
society. They were mostly Maidens, but the men&rsquo;s societies sent
their representatives, too, some fifty each, spreading tents well
above the ruins of Taien in slightly separated camps. Everyone
understood, or thought they did, about the Maidens carrying Rand&rsquo;s
honor, but all societies wanted to guard the <em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>.</p>

<p>Moiraine&mdash;and Lan, of course&mdash;went to get
Kadere&rsquo;s wagons settled, just below the town; the Aes Sedai fussed
over what was in those wagons nearly as much as she did over Rand.
The drivers muttered and cursed about the town&rsquo;s smell, and avoided
watching the Aiel cut bodies down from the wall, but after their
months in the Waste, they seemed to like being close even to the
wreckage of what they saw as civilization.</p>

<p><em>Gai&rsquo;shain</em> were erecting the Wise Ones&rsquo; tents&mdash;those of Amys and Bair and Melaine&mdash;below the town,
astride the faded track that led up out of the hills. Rand was sure
they would say they had chosen the spot to be available to him as
well as to the countless dozens of Wise Ones below, but he thought
it no coincidence that anyone coming up from the hills to him would
have to go through or around their camp to reach him. He was a
little surprised to see Melaine directing the white-robed figures.
Only three nights before, she had married Bael, in a ceremony that
made her his wife and first-sister to his other wife, Dorindha.
That part had been just as important as the marriage, apparently;
Aviendha had been shocked at his surprise, or maybe angry.</p>

<p>When Egwene arrived with Aviendha up behind her on
the gray mare, those full skirts pushed above their knees, they
looked a matched pair despite their different coloring and Aviendha
being tall enough to look over Egwene&rsquo;s shoulder without
stretching, each with just one ivory bracelet and one necklace. The
work of removing the hanged corpses had barely begun. Most of the
ravens lay dead, bundles of black feathers littering the ground,
and the rest had flown, but vultures too gorged to flap aloft still
waddled through the ashes inside the walls.</p>

<p>Rand wished that there was some way he could keep the
two women from having to see, but to his surprise, neither went
running to empty her stomach. Well, he had not really expected
anything of the sort from Aviendha; she had seen death often
enough, and dealt it out, too, and her face remained
expressionless. But he had not expected the pure pity in Egwene&rsquo;s
eyes as she gazed at the bloated dead coming down.</p>

<p>She drew Mist over to Jeade&rsquo;en and leaned to put a
hand on his arm. &ldquo;I am so sorry, Rand. There was no way you could
have stopped this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he told her. He had not even known there
was a town here until Rhuarc mentioned it casually five days ago&mdash;his councils with the chiefs had all been on whether they
could cover more ground in a day, and what Couladin would do when
he cleared the Jangai&mdash;and by that time the Shaido had
finished here and gone. He had done with cursing himself for a fool
then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, just you remember it. It was not your fault.&rdquo;
She heeled Mist on, and began talking to Aviendha before she was
out of earshot. &ldquo;I am glad he is taking it so well. He has the
habit of feeling guilty over things he cannot control.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men always believe they are in control of everything
around them,&rdquo; Aviendha replied. &ldquo;When they find out they are not,
they think they have failed, instead of learning a simple truth
women already know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene giggled. &ldquo;<em>That</em> is the simple truth.
Once I saw those poor people, I thought we would find him heaving
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is his stomach so tender? I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their voices faded away as the mare ambled on. Rand
pulled himself back upright in the saddle, flushing. Trying to
eavesdrop on them; he was behaving like an idiot. That did not stop
him frowning at their departing backs. He only took responsibility
for what he was accountable for, if only to himself. Just for
things he could do something about. And what he should have done
something about. He did not like them talking about him. Behind his
back, or under his nose. The Light only knew what they were
saying.</p>

<p>Dismounting, he led Jeade&rsquo;en in search of Asmodean,
who seemed to have wandered off. After so many days in the saddle,
it was good to walk. Various clusters of tents were springing up
along the pass; the mountain slopes and cliffs made formidable
barriers, but the Aiel still arranged themselves as if they could
expect attack from them. He had tried walking with the Aiel, but
half a day was enough to put him back on the horse. It was hard
enough to keep up with them mounted; they could wear out horses
when they pressed.</p>

<p>Mat was down, too, squatting with his reins in one
hand and that black-hafted spear across his knees, peering at the
gaping gates, studying the town and muttering to himself while Pips
tried to nibble at a thornbush. Mat was studying, not just staring.
Where had that remark about sentries come from? Mat said odd things
at times now, since their first visit to Rhuidean. Rand wished that
he were willing to talk about what had happened, but he still
denied that anything had, despite the foxhead medallion, the spear,
and that scar around his neck. Melindhra, the Shaido Maiden that
Mat had taken up with, was off to one side, watching Mat, until
Sulin came and chased her away on some errand. Rand wondered if Mat
knew the Maidens were laying bets on whether Melindhra would give
up the spear for him. And on whether she would teach him to sing,
too, though they only laughed when Rand asked what that meant.</p>

<p>The sound of music drew him to Asmodean, seated by
himself on a granite outcrop with his harp on his knee. The crimson
banner&rsquo;s staff had been twisted into the rocky soil, and the mule
tethered to it. &ldquo;You see, my Lord Dragon,&rdquo; he said cheerfully,
&ldquo;your bannerman keeps loyally to his duties.&rdquo; His voice and
expression changed, and he said, &ldquo;If you must have this thing, why
not let Mat carry it, or Lan? Or Moiraine, for that matter? She
would be glad to carry your banner, and clean your boots. Be
careful of her. She is a devious woman. When a woman says she will
obey you, of her own will, it is time to sleep lightly and watch
your back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You carry it because you were chosen, Master Jasin
Natael.&rdquo; Asmodean gave a start and looked around, though everyone
else was too far away, and too busy, to be listening. None but they
two would have understood, anyway. &ldquo;What do you know about those
ruins up near the snow line? They must come from the Age of
Legends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Asmodean did not even glance up the mountain. &ldquo;This
world is very changed from the world I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;went to sleep in.&rdquo; He
sounded weary, and he shivered slightly. &ldquo;What I know of what lies
where, I have learned since waking.&rdquo; The mournful sounds of &ldquo;The
March of Death&rdquo; rose from his harp. &ldquo;That could be what is left of
the city where I was born, for all I know. Shorelle was a
port.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sun had maybe an hour before the Spine of the
World hid it; this close to high mountains, night came early. &ldquo;I am
too tired for one of our discussions tonight.&rdquo; That was what they
called Asmodean&rsquo;s lessons in public, even when no one was around.
Added to practice sessions with Lan or Rhuarc, those lessons had
left him little time for sleep since leaving Rhuidean. &ldquo;You take to
your tent when you&rsquo;re ready, and I will see you in the morning.
With the banner.&rdquo; There was no one else to carry the bloody thing.
Maybe he could find somebody in Cairhien.</p>

<p>As he was turning away, Asmodean plucked something
discordant and said, &ldquo;No burning nets woven around my tent tonight?
Do you finally begin to trust me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand looked back over his shoulder. &ldquo;I trust you like
a brother. Until the day you betray me. You have a parole for what
you&rsquo;ve done, in return for your teaching, and a better bargain than
you deserve, but the day you turn against me, I will tear it up and
bury it with you.&rdquo; Asmodean opened his mouth, but Rand forestalled
him. &ldquo;That is me talking, Natael. Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Two Rivers folk
don&rsquo;t like people who try to stab them in the back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Irritably, he pulled at the dapple&rsquo;s reins and went
on before the other man could say anything. He was not sure whether
Asmodean had any inkling that a dead man was trying to take him
over, but he should not let himself give the man hints. Asmodean
was sure enough already that his was a helpless cause; if he began
to think that Rand was not in full control of his own mind, perhaps
that he was going mad, the Forsaken would abandon him in a
heartbeat, and there was too much Rand had to learn yet.</p>

<p>White-robed <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> were erecting his tent
under Aviendha&rsquo;s direction, well into the pass mouth, with that
huge carved snake rearing above. The <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> had their
own tents, but those would be the last erected, of course. Adelin
and a dozen or so Maidens squatted nearby, watching, waiting to
guard his sleep. Even with over a thousand Maidens encamped around
him every night, they still put a guard on his tent.</p>

<p>Before approaching, he reached out through the <em>
angreal</em> in his coat pocket to seize <em>saidin</em>. There was
no need to actually touch the carving of the fat little man with a
sword, of course. Mingled filth and sweetness filled him, that
raging river of fire, that crushing avalanche of ice. Channeling as
he had done every night since leaving Rhuidean, he set wards around
the entire encampment, not only what was in the pass but every tent
in the hills below as well, and on the slopes of the mountains. He
needed the <em>angreal</em> to set wardings so large, but only
just. He had thought that he was strong before, but Asmodean&rsquo;s
teachings were making him stronger. No human or animal crossing the
line of that ward would notice anything, but Shadowspawn that
touched it would sound a warning that everyone in the tents would
hear. Had he done this in Rhuidean, the Darkhounds could never have
entered without him knowing.</p>

<p>The Aiel themselves would have to keep watch for
human enemies. Wardings were complex weaves, if tenuous, and trying
to make them do more than one thing could render them useless, in
practicality. He could have made this one to kill Shadowspawn
instead of merely giving warning, but that would have been like a
beacon to any male Forsaken who might be searching, and to
Myrddraal, too. No need to bring his enemies down on him when they
might not know where he was. This, even one of the Forsaken would
not know until he was close, and a Myrddraal not until it was too
late.</p>

<p>Letting go of <em>saidin</em> was an exercise in
self-control, despite the foulness of the taint, despite the way
the Power tried to scour him away like sand on a riverbed, to burn
him, obliterate him. He floated in the vast emptiness of the Void,
yet he could feel the air stirring against each hair on his head,
see the weave of the <em>gai&rsquo;shain&rsquo;s</em> robes, smell Aviendha&rsquo;s
warm scent. He wanted more. But he could smell the ashes of Taien,
too, smell the who had been burned, the corruption of those who
not, even the ones already buried, mingled with the soil of their
graves. That helped. For a while after it was gone, all he did was
take deep breaths of hot, arid air; compared to before, the whiff of
death seemed absent, and the air itself pure and wonderful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look what was here before us,&rdquo; Aviendha said as he let
a meek-faced white-robed woman take Jeade&rsquo;en. She held up a brown
snake, dead, but as thick as his forearm and nearly three paces
long. The bloodsnake took its name from the effect of its bite,
turning the blood to jelly in minutes. Unless he missed his guess,
the neat wound behind its head had come from her belt knife. Adelin
and the other Maidens looked approving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever for one minute think that it could have
bitten you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did you ever think of using the Power
instead of a bloody belt knife? Why didn&rsquo;t you kiss it first? You
had to be close enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She drew herself up, and her big green eyes should
have brought on the night&rsquo;s chill early. &ldquo;The Wise Ones say it is
not good to use the Power too often.&rdquo; The clipped words were as
cold as her eyes. &ldquo;They say it is possible to draw too much and
harm yourself.&rdquo; Frowning slightly, she added, more to herself than
him, &ldquo;Though I have not come near what I can hold yet. I am sure of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shaking his head, he ducked into the tent. The woman
would not listen to reason.</p>

<p>No sooner had he settled himself against a silk
cushion near the still unlit fire than she followed him. Without
the bloodsnake, thankfully, but gingerly carrying something long
wrapped in thick layers of gray-striped blanket. &ldquo;You were worried
for me,&rdquo; she said in a flat voice. There was no expression at all
on her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; he lied. <em>Fool woman. She&rsquo;ll get
herself killed yet because she doesn&rsquo;t have the sense to be careful
when it&rsquo;s needed</em>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have been as worried for anyone. I
would not want anyone bitten by a bloodsnake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment she eyed him doubtfully, then gave a
quick nod. &ldquo;Good. So long as you do not presume toward me.&rdquo; Tossing
the bundled blanket at his feet, she sat on her heels across the
firepit from him. &ldquo;You would not accept the buckle as canceling
debt between us&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aviendha, there is no debt.&rdquo; He thought that she had
forgotten about that. She went on as if he had not spoken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but perhaps that will cancel it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sighing, he unwrapped the striped blanket&mdash;warily, since she had held it far more uneasily than she had the
snake; she had held the bloody snake as if it were a piece of cloth&mdash;unwrapped it, and gasped. What lay inside was a sword, the
scabbard so encrusted with rubies and moonstones that it was hard
to see the gold except where a rising sun of many rays had been
inset. The ivory hilt, long enough for two hands, had another
inlaid rising sun in gold; the pommel was thick with rubies and
moonstones, and still more made a solid mass along the quillons.
This had never been made to use, only to be seen. To be stared
at.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This must have cost&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Aviendha, how could you
pay for it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It cost little,&rdquo; she said, so defensively that she
might as well have added that she lied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sword. How did you ever come by a sword? How
did <em>any</em> Aiel come by a sword? Don&rsquo;t tell me Kadere had <em>
this</em> hidden in his wagons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I carried it in a blanket.&rdquo; She sounded even more
touchy now than she had about the price. &ldquo;Even Bair said that would
make it all right, so long as I did not actually touch it.&rdquo; She
shrugged uncomfortably, shifting and re-shifting her shawl. &ldquo;It was
the treekiller&rsquo;s sword. Laman&rsquo;s. It was taken from his body as
proof that he was dead, because his head could not be brought back
so far. Since then it has passed from hand to hand, young men or
fool Maidens who wanted to own the proof of his death. Only, each
began to think of what it was, and soon sold it to another fool.
The price has come down very far since it first was sold. No Aiel
would lay hand to it even to remove the stones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it is very beautiful,&rdquo; he said, as tactfully
as he could manage. Only a buffoon would carry something this
gaudy. And that ivory hilt would twist in a hand slippery with
sweat or blood. &ldquo;But I cannot let you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He trailed off as he
bared a few inches of the blade, out of habit, to examine the edge.
Etched into the shining steel stood a heron, symbol of a
blademaster. He had carried a sword marked like that once. Suddenly
he was ready to bet that this blade was like it, like the
raven-marked blade on Mat&rsquo;s spear, metal made with Power that would
never break and never need sharpening. Most blademasters&rsquo; swords
were only copies of those. Lan could tell him for certain, but he
was sure already in his own mind.</p>

<p>Pulling the scabbard off, he leaned across the
firepit to place it in front of her. &ldquo;I will take the blade to
cancel the debt, Aviendha.&rdquo; It was long and slightly curved, with a
single edge. &ldquo;Just the blade. You can have the hilt back, too.&rdquo; He
could have a new hilt and scabbard made in Cairhien. Maybe one of
Taien&rsquo;s survivors was a decent bladesmith.</p>

<p>She stared wide-eyed from the scabbard to him and
back, mouth open, stunned for the first time that he had ever seen.
&ldquo;But those gems are worth much, much more than I&mdash;You are
trying to put me in your debt again, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so.&rdquo; If this blade had lain untouched, and
untarnished, in its scabbard for over twenty years, it had to be
what he thought. &ldquo;I did not accept the scabbard, so it has been
yours all along.&rdquo; Tossing one of the silk cushions into the air, he
executed the seated version of the form called Low Wind Rising;
feathers rained down as the blade sliced neatly through. &ldquo;And I
don&rsquo;t accept the hilt, either, so that&rsquo;s yours, too. If you have
made a profit, it&rsquo;s your own doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead of looking happy at her good fortune&mdash;he suspected she had given everything that she had for the sword,
and likely gotten back a hundred times as much or more in the
scabbard alone&mdash;instead of seeming glad, or thanking him, she
glared through the feathers as indignantly as any goodwife in the
Two Rivers seeing her floor littered. Stiffly, she clapped, and one
of the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> appeared, immediately going to her knees
to begin cleaning up the mess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my tent,&rdquo; he said pointedly. Aviendha sniffed
at him in perfect imitation of Egwene. Those two women were
definitely spending too much time together.</p>

<p>Supper, when it came at full dark, consisted of the
usual flat pale bread, and a spicy stew of dried peppers and beans
with chunks of nearly white meat. He only grinned at her when he
learned that it was the bloodsnake; he had eaten snake and worse
since coming to the Waste. <em>Gara</em>&mdash;the poisonous
lizard&mdash;was the worst in his estimation; not for the taste,
which was rather like chicken, but because it was lizard. It
sometimes seemed that there must be more poisonous things&mdash;snakes, lizards, spiders, plants&mdash;in the Waste than in the
rest of the world combined.</p>

<p>Aviendha appeared disappointed that he did not spit
the stew out in disgust, though sometimes it was difficult to tell
what she was feeling. At times she seemed to take great pleasure in
discomfiting him. Had he been trying to pretend that he was Aiel,
he would have thought she was trying to prove he was not.</p>

<p>Tired and eager for sleep, he only took off his coat
and boots before crawling into his blankets and turning his back to
Aviendha. Aiel men and women might take sweat-baths together, but a
short time in Shienar, where they did something much the same, had
convinced him that he was not made for that sort of thing, not
without going so red in the face that he died of it. He tried not
to listen to the rustle of her undressing beneath her own blankets.
At least she had that much modesty, but he kept his back turned
anyway, just in case.</p>

<p>She claimed she was supposed to sleep there to
continue his lessons on Aiel ways and customs, since he spent so
much of his days with the chiefs. They both knew that was a lie,
though what the Wise Ones thought she could find out this way, he
could not imagine. She gave little grunts every now and then as she
tugged at something, and muttered to herself.</p>

<p>To cover the sounds, and stop himself thinking of
what they must mean, he said, &ldquo;Melaine&rsquo;s wedding was impressive.
Did Bael really know nothing about it until Melaine and Dorindha
told him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; she replied scornfully, pausing for
what he thought was a stocking coming off. &ldquo;Why should he know
before Melaine laid the bridal wreath at his feet and asked him?&rdquo;
Abruptly she laughed. &ldquo;Melaine nearly drove herself and Dorindha to
distraction finding <em>segade</em> blossoms for the wreath. Few
grow so close to the Dragonwall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does that mean something special? <em>Segade</em>
blossoms?&rdquo; That was what he had sent her, the flowers she had never
acknowledged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That she has a prickly nature and means to keep it.&rdquo;
Another pause, broken by mutters. &ldquo;Had she used leaves or flowers
from sweetroot, it would have meant she claimed a sweet nature.
Morning drop would mean she would be submissive, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;There
are too many to list. It would take me days to teach all the
combinations to you, and you do not need to know them. You will not
have an Aiel wife. You belong to Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nearly looked at her when she said &ldquo;submissive.&rdquo; A
word less likely to describe any Aiel woman he could not conceive.
<em>Probably means she gives warning before she stabs you</em>.</p>

<p>There had been more of a muffled sound to her voice
at the end. Pulling her blouse over her head, he realized. He
wished the lamps were out. No, that would have made it worse. But
then, he had been through this every single night since Rhuidean,
and every single night it was worse. He had to put an end to it.
The woman was going to sleep with the Wise Ones, where she
belonged, from now on; he would learn what he could from her as he
could. He had thought exactly the same thing for fifteen nights
now.</p>

<p>Trying to chase the pictures out of his head, he
said, &ldquo;That bit at the end. After the vows were said.&rdquo; No sooner
had half a dozen Wise Ones pronounced their blessings than a
hundred of Melaine&rsquo;s blood kin had rushed in to surround her, all
carrying their spears. A hundred of Bael&rsquo;s kin had rallied to him,
and he had fought his way to her. No one had been veiled, of course&mdash;it was all part of custom&mdash;but blood had still been
shed on both sides. &ldquo;A few minutes before, Melaine was vowing that
she loved him, but when he reached her, she fought like a cornered
ridgecat.&rdquo; If Dorindha had not punched her in the shortribs, he did
not think Bael would ever have gotten her over his shoulder to
carry off. &ldquo;He still has the limp and the black eye she gave
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should she have been a weakling?&rdquo; Aviendha said
sleepily. &ldquo;He had to know the worth of her. She was not a trinket
for him to put in his pouch.&rdquo; She yawned, and he heard her nestling
deeper into her blankets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does &lsquo;teaching a man to sing&rsquo; mean?&rdquo; Aiel men
did not sing, not once they were old enough to take up a spear,
except for battle chants and laments for the dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are thinking of Mat Cauthon?&rdquo; She actually
giggled. &ldquo;Sometimes, a man gives up the spear for a Maiden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making that up. I never heard of anything
like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it is not really giving up the spear.&rdquo; Her
voice held a thick muzziness. &ldquo;Sometimes a man desires a Maiden who
will not give up the spear for him, and he arranges to be taken
<em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> by her. He is a fool, of course. No Maiden would
look at <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> as he hopes. He is worked hard and kept
strictly to his place, and the first thing that is done is to make
him learn to sing, to entertain the spear-sisters while they eat.
&lsquo;She is going to teach him to sing.&rsquo; That is what Maidens say when
a man makes a fool of himself over one of the spear-sisters.&rdquo; A
very peculiar people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aviendha?&rdquo; He had said he was not going to ask her
this again. Lan said it was Kandori work, a pattern called
snowflakes. Probably loot from some raid up north. &ldquo;Who gave you
that necklace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A friend, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. We came far today, and you
will start us early tomorrow. Sleep well and wake, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;
Only an Aiel would wish you a good night by hoping you did not die
in your sleep.</p>

<p>Setting the much smaller if much more intricate ward
on his dreams, he channeled the lamps out and tried to sleep. A
friend. The Reyn came from the north. But she had had the necklace
in Rhuidean. Why did he care? Aviendha&rsquo;s slow breathing seemed loud
in his ears until he fell asleep, and then he dreamed a confused
dream of Min and Elayne helping him throw Aviendha, wearing nothing
but that necklace, over his shoulder, while she beat him over the
head with a wreath of <em>segade</em> blossoms.</p>
