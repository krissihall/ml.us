<h4><em>A Hound of Darkness</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">L</span>iandrin
guided her horse through the crowded streets
of Amador, the sneer on her rosebud lips hidden by her deep,
curving bonnet. She had hated to give up her multitude of braids,
and hated even more the ludicrous fashions of this ludicrous land;
the reddish yellow of hat and riding dress she rather liked, but
not the large velvet bows on both. Still, the bonnet hid her eyes&mdash;combined with honey-yellow hair, brown eyes would have named
her Taraboner in an instant, not a good thing in Amadicia just
now&mdash;and it hid what would have been even worse to show here,
an Aes Sedai&rsquo;s face. Safely hidden, she could smirk at the
Whitecloaks, who seemed to be every fifth man in the streets. Not
that the soldiers who made another fifth would have been any
better. None of them ever thought to look inside the bonnet, of
course. Aes Sedai were outlawed here, and that meant there were
none.</p>

<p>Even so, she felt a little better when she turned in
at the elaborate iron gates in front of Jorin Arene&rsquo;s house.
Another fruitless trip looking for word from the White Tower; there
had been nothing since she had learned that Elaida thought she was
in control of the Tower, and that the Sanche woman had been
disposed of. Siuan had escaped, true, but she was a useless rag
now.</p>

<p>The gardens behind the gray stone fence were full of
plants going rather brown from lack of rain, but trimmed and
trained into cubes and balls, though one was shaped like a leaping
horse. Only one, of course. Merchants like Arene mimicked their
betters, but they dared not go too far lest someone think their
conceit too high. Elaborate balconies decorated the large wooden
house with its red-tiled roofs, and even a colonnade of carved
columns, but unlike the lord&rsquo;s dwelling it was meant to copy, it
stood on a stone foundation no more than ten feet tall. A childish
pretense at a noble&rsquo;s manor.</p>

<p>The stringy, gray-haired man who scurried out
deferentially to hold her stirrup while she dismounted, and take
her reins, was clad all in black. Whatever colors a merchant chose
for livery, they were sure to be some real lord&rsquo;s colors, and even
a minor lord could cause trouble for the richest seller of goods.
People in the streets called black &ldquo;merchant&rsquo;s livery,&rdquo; and
snickered when they said it. Liandrin despised the groom&rsquo;s black
coat as much as she did Arene&rsquo;s house and Arene himself. She would
have true manors, one day. Palaces. They had been promised to her,
and the power that went with them.</p>

<p>Stripping off her riding gloves, she stalked up the
ridiculous ramp that slanted along the foundations to the
vine-carved front doors. The lords&rsquo; fortress manors had ramps, so
of course a merchant who thought well of himself could not have
steps. A black-clad young serving girl took gloves and hat in the
round entrance hail, with its many doors and carved and brightly
painted columns and its encircling balcony. The ceiling was
lacquered in imitation of a mosaic, stars within stars in gold and
black. &ldquo;I will have my bath in one hour,&rdquo; she told the woman. &ldquo;It
will be the proper temperature this time, yes?&rdquo; The maid went pale
as she curtsied, stammering agreement before scurrying away.</p>

<p>Amellia Arene, Jorin s wife, came through one of the
doors deep in conversation with a fat balding man in a spotless
white apron. Liandrin breathed contemptuously. The woman had
pretensions, yet she not only spoke to the cook herself, she
brought the man out of his kitchens to discuss meals. She treated
the servant like&mdash;like a friend!</p>

<p>Fat Evon saw her first and gulped, his piggy eyes
darting away immediately. She did not like men looking at her, and
she had spoken sharply to him on her first day here about the way
his gaze sometimes lingered. He had tried to deny it, but she knew
men&rsquo;s vile habits. Without waiting to be dismissed by his mistress,
Evon all but ran back the way he had come.</p>

<p>The graying merchant&rsquo;s wife had been a stern-faced
woman when Liandrin and the others came. Now she licked her lips
and smoothed her bow-draped green silk needlessly. &ldquo;There is
someone upstairs with the others, my Lady,&rdquo; she said diffidently.
She had thought that she could use Liandrin&rsquo;s name that first day.
&ldquo;In the front withdrawing room. From Tar Valon, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wondering who it could be, Liandrin started for the
nearest of the curving staircases. She knew few others of the Black
Ajah, of course, for safety&rsquo;s sake; what others did not know, they
could not betray. In the Tower she had known only one of the twelve
who went with her when she left. Two of the twelve were dead, and
she knew at whose feet to lay the blame. Egwene al&rsquo;Vere, Nynaeve
al&rsquo;Meara, and Elayne Trakand. Everything had gone so badly in
Tanchico that she would have thought those three upstart Accepted
had been there, except that they were fools who had twice walked
tamely into traps she had set. That they had escaped each was of no
consequence. Had they been in Tanchico, they would have fallen into
her hands, whatever Jeaine claimed to have seen. The next time she
found them, they would never escape anything again. She would be
done with them whatever her orders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lady,&rdquo; Amellia stammered. &ldquo;My husband, my Lady.
Jorin. Please, will one of you help him? He did not mean it, my
Lady. He has learned his lesson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liandrin paused with one hand on the carved banister,
looking back over her shoulder. &ldquo;He should not have thought that
his oaths to the Great Lord could be conveniently forgotten,
no?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He <em>has</em> learned, my Lady. Please. He lies
beneath blankets all day&mdash;in this heat&mdash;shivering. He
weeps when anyone touches him, or speaks above a whisper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liandrin paused as if considering, then nodded
graciously. &ldquo;I will ask Chesmal to see what she can do. Yet you
understand that I make no promises.&rdquo; The woman&rsquo;s unsteady thanks
followed her up, but she paid them no mind. Temaile had let herself
be carried away. She had been Gray Ajah before becoming Black, and
she always made a point of spreading the pain evenly when she
mediated; she had been very successful as a mediator, for she liked
spreading pain. Chesmal said he might be able to do small tasks in
a few months, so long as they were not too hard and no one raised a
voice. She had been one of the best Healers in generations among
the Yellow, so she should know.</p>

<p>The front withdrawing room startled her when she went
in. Nine of the ten Black sisters who had come with her stood
around the room against the carved and painted paneling, though
there were plenty of silk-cushioned chairs on the gold-fringed
carpet. The tenth, Temaile Kinderode, was handing a delicate
porcelain cup of tea to a dark-haired, sturdily handsome woman in a
bronze-colored gown of unfamiliar cut. The seated woman looked
vaguely familiar, though she was not Aes Sedai; she was plainly
approaching her middle years, and despite smooth cheeks there was
nothing of agelessness about her.</p>

<p>Yet the mood made Liandrin cautious. Temaile was
deceptively fragile in appearance, with big, childlike blue eyes
that made people trust her, those eyes appeared worried now, or
uneasy, and the teacup rattled on the saucer before the other woman
took it. Every face looked uneasy, except that of the oddly
familiar woman. Coppery-skinned Jeaine Caide, in one of those
disgusting Domani garments that she wore inside the house, had
tears still glistening on her cheeks; she had been a Green, and
liked flaunting herself in front of men even more than most Greens.
Rianna Andomeran, once White and always a coldly arrogant killer,
nervously kept touching the pale streak in her black hair above her
left ear. Her arrogance had been flattened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has happened here?&rdquo; Liandrin demanded. &ldquo;Who are
you, and what&mdash;?&rdquo; Suddenly the memory flashed into her head. A
Darkfriend, a servant in Tanchico who had continually gotten above
herself. &ldquo;Gyldin!&rdquo; she snapped. This servant had followed them in
some fashion and obviously was trying to pass herself off as a
Black courier with some dire news. &ldquo;You have overstepped yourself
too far this time.&rdquo; She reached to embrace <em>saidar</em>, yet
even as she did the glow surrounded the other woman, and Liandrin&rsquo;s
reach ran into a thick invisible wall shutting her away from the
Source. It hung there like the sun, tantalizingly out of reach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop gaping, Liandrin,&rdquo; the woman said calmly. &ldquo;You
look like a fish. It is not Gyldin, but Moghedien. This tea needs
more honey, Temaile.&rdquo; The slender, fox-faced woman darted to take
the cup, breathing heavily.</p>

<p>It had to be so. Who else could have so cowed the
others? Liandrin looked at them standing around the walls.
Round-faced Eldrith Jhondar, for once not looking vague at all
despite an ink smudge on her nose, nodded vigorously. The others
seemed afraid to twitch. Why one of the Forsaken&mdash;they were
not supposed to use that name, but usually did, among themselves&mdash;why Moghedien would have masqueraded as a servant, she could
not understand. The woman had or could have everything that she
herself wanted. Not just knowledge of the One Power beyond her
dreams, but power. Power over others, power over the world. And
immortality. Power for a lifetime that would never end. She and her
sisters had speculated on dissension among the Forsaken; there had
been orders at odds with each other, and orders given to other
Darkfriends at odds with theirs. Perhaps Moghedien had been hiding
from the rest of the Forsaken.</p>

<p>Liandrin spread her divided riding skirts as best she
could in a deep curtsy. &ldquo;We welcome you, Great Mistress. With the
Chosen to lead us, we shall surely triumph before the Day of the
Great Lord&rsquo;s Return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nicely said,&rdquo; Moghedien said dryly, taking the cup
back from Temaile. &ldquo;Yes, this is much better.&rdquo; Temaile looked
absurdly grateful, and relieved. What had Moghedien done?</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought came to Liandrin, an unwelcome
one. She had treated one of the Chosen as a servant. &ldquo;Great
Mistress, in Tanchico I did not know that you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you did not,&rdquo; Moghedien said irritably.
&ldquo;What good to bide my time in the shadows if you and these others
knew me?&rdquo; Abruptly a small smile appeared on her lips; it touched
nothing else. &ldquo;Are you worried about those times you sent Gyldin to
the cook to be beaten?&rdquo; Sweat beaded suddenly on Liandrin&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;Do you truly believe I would allow such a thing? The man no doubt
reported to you, but he remembered what I wanted him to remember.
He actually felt sorry for Gyldin, so cruelly treated by her
mistress.&rdquo; That seemed to amuse her greatly. &ldquo;He gave me some of
the desserts that he made for you. It would not displease me if he
still lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liandrin drew a relieved breath. She would not die.
&ldquo;Great Mistress, there is no need to shield me. I also serve the
Great Lord. I swore my oaths as a Darkfriend before ever I went to
the White Tower. I sought the Black Ajah from the day that I knew
that I could channel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you will be the only one in this ill-ordered pack
who does not need to learn who her mistress is?&rdquo; Moghedien quirked
an eyebrow. &ldquo;I would not have thought it of you.&rdquo; The glow around
her vanished. &ldquo;I have tasks for you. For all of you. Whatever you
have been doing, you will forget. You are an inept lot, as you
proved in Tanchico. With my hand on the dog whip, perhaps you will
hunt more successfully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We await orders from the Tower, Great Mistress,&rdquo;
Liandrin said. Inept! They had almost found what they were hunting
for in Tanchico, when the city exploded in riots; they had barely
escaped destruction at the hands of Aes Sedai who had somehow
wandered into the middle of their plan. Had Moghedien revealed
herself, or even taken part on their behalf, they would have
triumphed. If their failure was anyone&rsquo;s fault, it was Moghedien&rsquo;s
herself. Liandrin reached toward the True Source, not to embrace
it, but to be certain that the shield had not merely been tied off.
It was gone. &ldquo;We have been given great responsibilities, great
works to perform, and surely we will be commanded to continue&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moghedien cut her off sharply. &ldquo;You serve whichever
of the Chosen chooses to snap you up. Whoever sends you orders from
the White Tower, she takes her own from one of us now, and very
likely grovels on her belly when she does. You will serve me,
Liandrin. Be sure of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moghedien did not know who headed the Black Ajah. It
was a revelation. Moghedien did not know everything. Liandrin had
always imagined the Forsaken as close to omnipotent, something far
beyond ordinary mortals. Perhaps the woman truly was in flight
from the other Forsaken. To hand her over to them would surely earn
her a high place. She might even become one of them. She had a
trick, learned in childhood. And she could touch the Source. &ldquo;Great
Mistress, we serve the Great Lord, as you do. We also were promised
eternal life, and power, when the Great Lord re&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think that you are my equal, little sister?&rdquo;
Moghedien grimaced in disgust. &ldquo;Did you stand in the Pit of Doom to
dedicate your soul to the Great Lord? Did you taste the sweetness
of victory at Paaran Disen, or the bitter ashes at the Asar Don?
You are a barely trained puppy, not the pack-mistress, and you will
go where I point until I see fit to give you a better place. These
others thought themselves more than they are, too. Do you wish to
try your strength against me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not, Great Mistress.&rdquo; Not when she was
forewarned and ready. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will do so sooner or later, and I prefer to put
it out of the way now, in the beginning. Why do you think your
companions look so cheerful? I have taught each of them the same
lesson already today. I will not wonder when you must be taught,
too. I will be done with it now. Try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Licking her lips fearfully, Liandrin looked around at
the women standing rigidly against the walls. Only Asne Zeramene so
much as blinked; she shook her head ever so slightly. Asne&rsquo;s tilted
eyes, high cheekbones and strong nose marked her Saldaean, and she
had all the vaunted Saldaean boldness. If she counseled against, if
her dark eyes held a tinge of fear, then it was surely best to
grovel however much was needed to make Moghedien relent. And yet,
there was her trick.</p>

<p>She went to her knees, head low, looking up at the
Forsaken with a fear that was only partly feigned. Moghedien
lounged in her chair, sipping the tea. &ldquo;Great Mistress, I beg you
to forgive me if I have presumed. I know that I am but a worm
beneath your foot. I beg, as one who would be your faithful hound,
for your mercy on this wretched dog.&rdquo; Moghedien&rsquo;s eyes dropped to
her cup, and in a flash, while the words still tumbled from her
mouth, Liandrin embraced the Source and channeled, seeking the
crack that must be in the Forsaken&rsquo;s confidence, the crack that was
in everyone&rsquo;s fa&ccedil;ade of strength.</p>

<p>Even as she lashed out, the light of <em>saidar</em>
surrounded the other woman, and pain enveloped Liandrin. She
crumpled to the carpet, trying to howl, but agony beyond anything
she had ever known silenced her gaping mouth. Her eyes were going
to burst from her head; her skin was going to peel away in strips.
For an eternity she thrashed, and when it vanished as suddenly as
it had begun, all she could do was lie there, shuddering and
weeping openmouthed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you begin to see?&rdquo; Moghedien said calmly, handing
the empty cup to Temaile with, &ldquo;That was very good. But next time a
little stronger.&rdquo; Temaile looked as though she might faint. &ldquo;You
are not quick enough, Liandrin, you are not strong enough, and you
do not know enough. That pitiful little thing you tried against me.
Would you like to see what it is really like?&rdquo; She channeled.</p>

<p>Liandrin gazed up at her adoringly. Crawling across
the floor, she pushed words through the sobs she still could not
stop. &ldquo;Forgive me, Great Mistress.&rdquo; This magnificent woman, like a
star in the heavens, a comet, above all kings and queens in wonder.
&ldquo;Forgive, please,&rdquo; she begged, pressing kisses against the hem of
Moghedien&rsquo;s skirt as she babbled. &ldquo;Forgive. I am a dog, a worm.&rdquo; It
shamed her to her core that she had not meant those things before.
They were true. Before this woman, they were all true. &ldquo;Let me
serve you, Great Mistress. Allow me to serve. Please. Please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not Graendal,&rdquo; Moghedien said, pushing her away
roughly with one velvet-slippered foot.</p>

<p>Suddenly the sense of worship was gone. Lying there
in a heap, weeping, Liandrin could remember it clearly, though. She
stared at the Forsaken in horror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you convinced yet, Liandrin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Great Mistress,&rdquo; she managed. She was.
Convinced that she dared not even think of trying again until she
was certain of success. Her trick was only the palest shadow of
what Moghedien had done. Could she but learn that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall see. I think you may be one of those who
needs a second lesson. Pray it is not so, Liandrin; I make second
lessons exceedingly sharp. Now take your place with the others. You
will find that I have taken some of the objects of power that you
had in your room, but you may keep the trinkets that remain. Am I
not kind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Great Mistress is kind,&rdquo; Liandrin agreed around
hiccoughs and occasional sobs that she could not stifle.</p>

<p>Limply she staggered to her feet and went to stand
beside Asne; the wall panel against her back helped to hold her
upright. She saw the flows of Air being woven; only Air, but she
still flinched as they bound her mouth shut and stopped sound from
her ears. She certainly did not try to resist. She did not even let
herself think of <em>saidar</em>. Who knew what one of the Forsaken
could do? Perhaps read her thoughts. That almost made her run. No.
If Moghedien knew her thoughts, she would be dead by now. Or still
screaming on the floor. Or kissing Moghedien&rsquo;s feet and begging to
serve. Liandrin shivered uncontrollably; if that weave had not
bound her mouth, her teeth would have been chattering.</p>

<p>Moghedien wove the same around all of them save
Rianna, whom the Forsaken beckoned with an imperious finger to
kneel before her. Then Rianna left, and Marillin Gemalphin was
unbound and summoned.</p>

<p>From where she stood, Liandrin could see their faces
even if their mouths moved soundlessly for her. Plainly each woman
was receiving orders the others knew nothing of. The faces told
little, though. Rianna merely listened, a touch of relief in her
eyes, bowed her head in assent and went. Marillin looked surprised,
and then eager, but she had been a Brown, and Browns could be
enthusiastic over anything that allowed them a chance to unearth
some moldy bit of lost knowledge. Jeaine Caide donned a slow mask
of horror, shaking her head at first and trying to cover herself
and that disgustingly sheer gown, but Moghedien&rsquo;s face hardened,
and Jeaine nodded hurriedly and fled, if not as eagerly as
Marillin, just as quickly. Berylla Naron, lean almost to
scrawniness and as fine a manipulator and plotter as there was, and
Falion Bhoda, long-faced and cold despite her obvious fear, showed
as little expression as Rianna had. Ispan Shefar, like Liandrin
from Tarabon, though dark-haired, actually kissed Moghedien&rsquo;s hem
before she rose.</p>

<p>Then the flows were unwoven around Liandrin. She
thought that it was her turn to be sent away on the Shadow knew
what errand, until she saw the bonds dispelled around the others
remaining as well. Moghedien&rsquo;s finger beckoned peremptorily, and
Liandrin knelt between Asne and Chesmal Emry, a tall, handsome
woman, dark-haired and dark-eyed. Chesmal, once Yellow, could Heal
or kill with equal ease, but the intensity of her gaze on
Moghedien, the way her hands trembled as they clutched her skirts,
said she intended only to obey.</p>

<p>She would have to go by such signs, Liandrin
realized. Approaching one of the others with her belief that
rewards could be had for handing Moghedien to the rest of the
Forsaken might well be disastrous if the one she spoke to had
decided that it was in her best interests to be Moghedien&rsquo;s lapdog.
She almost whimpered at the thought of a &ldquo;second lesson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, I keep with me,&rdquo; the Forsaken said, &ldquo;for the
most important task. What the others do may bear sweet fruit, but
to me yours will be the most important harvest. A personal harvest.
There is a woman named Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara.&rdquo; Liandrin&rsquo;s head came up,
and Moghedien&rsquo;s dark eyes sharpened. &ldquo;You know of her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I despise her,&rdquo; Liandrin replied truthfully. &ldquo;She is
a filthy wilder who ought never to have been allowed in the Tower.&rdquo;
She loathed all wilders. Dreaming of being Black Ajah, she herself
had begun learning to channel a full year before going to the
Tower, but she was in no way a wilder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good. You five are going to find her for me. I
want her alive. Oh, yes, I do want her alive.&rdquo; Moghedien&rsquo;s smile
made Liandrin shiver; giving Nynaeve and the other two to her might
be entirely suitable. &ldquo;The day before yesterday she was in a
village called Sienda, perhaps sixty miles east of here, with
another young woman in whom I may be interested, but they have
vanished. You will&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liandrin listened eagerly. For this, she could be a
faithful hound. For the other, she would wait patiently.</p>
