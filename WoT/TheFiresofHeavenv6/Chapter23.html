<h4>&ldquo;<em>The Fifth, I Give You</em>&rdquo;</h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">R</span>eining
Mist around on a grassy hilltop, Egwene
watched the streams of Aiel coming down from the Jangai Pass. The
saddle had pushed her skirts above her knees again, but she hardly
noticed that now. She could not spend every minute fussing with
them. And she had on stockings; it was not as though she were
bare-legged.</p>

<p>In trotting columns the Aiel flowed by below her,
arranged by clan and sept and society. Thousands upon thousands,
with their packhorses and mules, the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> who would
tend the camps while the rest fought, spreading a mile wide, and
more still in the pass or already out of sight ahead. Even without
families, it seemed a nation on the march. The Silk Path had been a
road here, a full fifty paces wide and paved with broad white
stones, slicing straight through hills carved to make a level. Only
occasionally was it visible through the mass of Aiel, although they
seemed to prefer running on the grass, but many of the paving
stones had lifted up at a corner or sunk down at one end. More than
twenty years had gone by since this road had carried more than
local farmers&rsquo; carts and a handful of wagons.</p>

<p>It was startling to see trees again, real trees,
towering oaks and leatherleaf in actual thickets rather than an
occasional wind-twisted, stunted shape, and tall grass waving in
the breeze across the hills. There was real forest to the north,
and clouds in the sky, thin and high, yet clouds. The air seemed
blessedly cool after the Waste, and moist, though brown leaves and
large brown swaths through the grass told her that in reality it
might be hotter and drier than usual for the time of year. Still,
the countryside of Cairhien was a lush paradise compared to the
other side of the Dragonwall.</p>

<p>A small stream meandered north beneath a nearly flat
bridge, bordered by the dried clay of a broader bed; the River
Gaelin lay not too many miles away in that direction. She wondered
what the Aiel would make of that river; she had seen Aiel near a
river once before. The shrunken band of water marked a definite
break in the steady flow of people, as men and Maidens paused to
stare in amazement before leaping across.</p>

<p>Kadere&rsquo;s wagons rumbled by on the road, the long mule
teams working hard, but still losing ground to the Aiel. It had
taken four days to traverse the twists and turns of the pass, and
Rand apparently intended to go as far into Cairhien as he could in
the few hours of daylight remaining. Moiraine and Lan rode with the
wagons; not ahead of them, or even with Kadere&rsquo;s boxlike little
white house on wheels, but alongside the second wagon, where the
canvas-covered shape of the doorframe <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> made a
hump above the rest of the load. Some of the load was wrapped
carefully or packed in boxes or barrels that Kadere had brought
into the Waste full of his goods, and some was simply stuck in
wherever it would fit, odd shapes of metal and glass, a red crystal
chair, two child-sized statues of a nude man and woman, rods of
bone and ivory and strange black materials in varying lengths and
thicknesses. All sorts of things, including some Egwene could
hardly begin to describe. Moiraine had used every inch of space in
all of the wagons.</p>

<p>Egwene wished that she knew why the Aes Sedai was so
concerned with that particular wagon; perhaps no one else had
noticed that Moiraine paid it more attention than all the others
combined, but she had. Not that she was likely to find out any time
soon. Her newfound equality with Moiraine was a tender thing, as
she had learned when she asked that question, in the heart of the
pass, and was told that her imagination was too vivid and if she
had time to spy on the Aes Sedai, perhaps Moiraine should speak to
the Wise Ones about intensifying her training. She had apologized
profusely, of course, and the soft words seemed to have worked.
Amys and the others were not taking any more of her nights than
they had before.</p>

<p>A hundred or so Taardad <em>Far Dareis Mai</em> went
trotting by on her side of the road, moving easily, veils hanging
but ready to be donned, full quivers at hips. Some carried their
curved horn bows, arrows nocked, while others had their bows cased
on their backs, spears and bucklers swinging rhythmically as they
ran. At their rear a dozen <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> in their white robes
leading pack mules struggled to keep up. One wore black, not white;
Isendre labored hardest of all. Egwene could pick Adelin out, and
two or three others who had been guarding Rand&rsquo;s tent the night of
the attack. Each clutched a doll in addition to her weapons, a
rough-made doll clothed in full skirts and white blouse; they
looked even more stone-faced than usual, trying to pretend that
they held no such thing.</p>

<p>She was not sure what that was about. The Maidens who
stood that guard had come in a group to see Bair and Amys when
their stint was done, and had spent a long time with them. The next
morning, while camp was still breaking in the grayness before dawn,
they had begun making those dolls. She had not been able to ask, of
course, but she had commented on it to one, a red-haired Tomanelle
of the Serai sept named Maira, and the woman said it was to remind
her that she was not a child. Her tone made it clear that she did
not want to talk. One of the Maidens carrying a doll was no more
than sixteen, yet Maira was at least as old as Adelin. It made
little sense, and that was frustrating. Every time Egwene thought
she understood Aiel ways, something demonstrated that she did
not.</p>

<p>Despite herself, her eyes were drawn back to the
mouth of the pass. The row of stakes was still there, just visible,
stretching from steep mountain slope to steep mountain slope except
where Aiel had kicked some of them down. Couladin had left another
message, men and women impaled across their path, standing there
seven days dead. The tall gray walls of Selean clung to the hills
at the right of the pass, nothing showing above them. Moiraine said
it had held only a shadow of its one-time glory, yet it had still
been a considerable town, much larger than Taien; no more remained
of it, however. No survivors, either&mdash;except whoever the
Shaido had carried off&mdash;although here some had probably run
for places they thought safe. There had been farms on these hills;
most of eastern Cairhien had been abandoned after the Aiel War, but
a town needed farms for food. Now soot-streaked chimneys thrust up
from blackened stone farmhouse walls; here a few charred rafters
remained above a stone barn, there barn and farmhouse had collapsed
from the heat. The hill where she sat Mist&rsquo;s saddle had been sheep
pasture; near the fence at the foot of the hill, flies still buzzed
over the refuse of butchering. Not an animal remained in any
pasture, not a chicken scratching in a barnyard. The crop fields
were burned stubble.</p>

<p>Couladin and the Shaido were Aiel. But so were
Aviendha, and Bair and Amys and Melaine, and Rhuarc, who said she
reminded him of one of his daughters. They had been disgusted at
the impalements, yet even they seemed to think it little more than
the treekillers deserved. Perhaps the only way to truly know the
Aiel was to be born Aiel.</p>

<p>Casting a last glance at the destroyed town, she rode
slowly down to the rough stone fence and let herself out at the
gate, leaning down to refasten the rawhide thong out of habit. The
irony was that Moiraine had said that Selean might actually go over
to Couladin. In the shifting currents of <em>Daes Dae&rsquo;mar</em>, in
balancing an Aiel invader against a man who had sent Tairens into
Cairhien, for whatever reason, the decision could have tipped
either way, had Couladin given them a chance to choose.</p>

<p>She rode along the broad road until she caught up
with Rand, in his red coat today, and joined Aviendha and Amys and
thirty or more Wise Ones she barely knew besides the other two
dreamwalkers, all following at a short distance. Mat, with his hat
and his black-hafted spear, and Jasin Natael, leather-cased harp
slung on his back and crimson banner rippling in the breeze, were
riding, but hurrying Aiel passed the party by on both sides,
because Rand led his dapple stallion, talking with the clan chiefs.
Skirts or no skirts, the Wise Ones would have made a good job of
keeping up with the passing columns if they were not sticking to
Rand like pine sap. They barely glanced at Egwene, their eyes and
ears focused on him and the six chiefs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and whoever comes through after Timolan,&rdquo;
Rand was saying in a firm voice, &ldquo;has to be told the same thing.&rdquo;
Stone Dogs left to watch at Taien had returned to report the
Miagoma entering the pass a day behind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to stop Couladin
despoiling this land, not to loot it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hard message,&rdquo; Bael said, &ldquo;for us as well, if you
mean we cannot take the fifth.&rdquo; Han and the rest, even Rhuarc,
nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fifth, I give you.&rdquo; Rand did not raise his
voice, yet suddenly his words were driven nails. &ldquo;But no part of
that is to be food. We will live on what can be found wild or
hunted or bought&mdash;if there is anyone with food to sell&mdash;until I can have the Tairens increase what they&rsquo;re bringing up from
Tear. If any man takes a penny more than the fifth, or a loaf of
bread without payment, if he burns so much as a hut because it
belongs to a treekiller, or kills a man who is not trying to kill
him, that man will I hang, whoever he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dark to tell the clans this,&rdquo; Dhearic said, almost
as stony. &ldquo;I came to follow He Who Comes With the Dawn, not to
coddle oathbreakers.&rdquo; Bael and Jheran opened their mouths as if to
agree, but each saw the other and snapped his teeth shut again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mark what I said, Dhearic,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;I came to
save this land, not ruin it further. What I say stands for every
clan, including the Miagoma and any more who follow. Every clan.
You mark me well.&rdquo; This time no one spoke, and he swung back into
Jeade&rsquo;en&rsquo;s saddle, letting the stallion walk on among the chiefs.
Those Aiel faces showed no expression.</p>

<p>Egwene drew breath. Those men were all old enough to
be his father and more, leaders of their people as surely as kings
for all they disclaimed it, hardened leaders in battle. It seemed
only yesterday that he had been a boy in more than age, a youth who
asked and hoped rather than commanded and expected to be obeyed. He
was changing faster than she could keep up with now. A good thing,
if he kept these men from doing to other cities what Couladin had
done to Taien and Selean. She told herself that. She only wished
he could do it without showing more arrogance every day. How soon
before he expected her to obey him as Moiraine did? Or all Aes
Sedai? She hoped it was only arrogance.</p>

<p>Wanting to talk, she kicked a foot free of its
stirrup and held a hand down for Aviendha, but the Aiel woman shook
her head. She really did not like to ride. And maybe all those Wise
Ones striding in a pack made her reluctant, too. Some of them would
not have ridden had both their legs been broken. With a sigh,
Egwene climbed down, leading Mist by the reins, settling her skirts
a little grumpily. The soft, knee-high Aiel boots she wore looked
comfortable and were, but not for walking very far on that hard,
uneven pavement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He truly is in command,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Aviendha barely shifted her eyes from Rand&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;I
do not know him. I cannot know him. Look at the thing he
carries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She meant the sword, of course. Rand did not
precisely carry it; it hung at the pommel of his saddle, in a plain
scabbard of brown boar-hide, the long hilt covered in the same
leather, rising as high as his waist. He had had hilt and scabbard
made by a man from Taien, on the journey through the pass. Egwene
wondered why, when he could channel a sword of fire, and do other
things that made swords seem toys. &ldquo;You did give it to him,
Aviendha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her friend scowled. &ldquo;He tries to make me accept the
hilt, too. He used it; it is his. Used it in front of me, as if to
mock me with a sword in his hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not angry about the sword.&rdquo; She did not
think Aviendha was; she had not said a word about it, that night in
Rand&rsquo;s tent. &ldquo;You are still upset over how he spoke to you, and I
do understand. I know he is sorry. He sometimes speaks without
thinking, but if you would only let him apologize&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not want his apologies,&rdquo; Aviendha muttered. &ldquo;I
do not want&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I can bear this no more. I cannot sleep in his
tent any longer.&rdquo; Suddenly she took Egwene&rsquo;s arm, and if Egwene had
not known better, she would have thought her on the brink of tears.
&ldquo;You must speak to them for me. To Amys and Bair and Melaine. They
will listen to you. You are Aes Sedai. They must let me return to
their tents. They must!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who must do what?&rdquo; Sorilea said, dropping back from
the others to walk alongside them. The Wise One of Shende Hold had
thin white hair and a face like leather drawn tight over her skull.
And clear green eyes that could knock a horse down at ten paces.
That was the way she normally looked at anyone. When Sorilea was
angry, other Wise Ones sat quietly and clan chiefs made excuses to
leave.</p>

<p>Melaine and another Wise One, a graying Black Water
Nakai, started to join them too, until Sorilea turned those eyes on
them. &ldquo;If you were not so busy thinking of that new husband,
Melaine, you would know Amys wants to talk with you. You, also,
Aerin.&rdquo; Melaine flushed bright red, and <em>scurried</em> back to
the others, but the older woman got there first. Sorilea watched
them go, then put her full attention on Aviendha. &ldquo;Now we can have
a quiet talk. So you do not want to do something. Something you
were told to do, of course. And you think this child Aes Sedai can
get you out of doing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorilea, I&mdash;&rdquo; Aviendha got no further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my day, girls jumped when a Wise One said jump,
and continued jumping until they were told to stop. As I am still
alive, it is still my day. Need I make myself clearer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha took a deep breath. &ldquo;No, Sorilea,&rdquo; she said
meekly.</p>

<p>The old woman&rsquo;s eyes came to rest on Egwene. &ldquo;And
you? Do you think you are going to beg her off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sorilea.&rdquo; Egwene felt as though she should
curtsy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Sonlea said, not sounding satisfied, just as
if it was what she had expected. It almost certainly was. &ldquo;Now I
can speak to you of what I really want to know. I hear the <em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> has given you an interest gift like no other ever
heard of, rubies and moonstones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha jumped as if a mouse had run up her leg.
Well, she probably would not, but it was the way Egwene would have
jumped in that circumstance. The Aiel explained about Laman&rsquo;s sword
and the scabbard so hastily that her words tripped over one
another.</p>

<p>Sorilea shifted her shawl, muttering about girls
touching swords, even wrapped in blankets, and about having a sharp
word with &ldquo;young Bair.&rdquo; &ldquo;So he has not captured your eye. A pity.
It would bind him to us; he sees too many people as his, now.&rdquo; For
a moment she eyed Aviendha up and down. &ldquo;I will have Feran look at
you. His greatfather is my sister-son. You have other duties to the
people than learning to be a Wise One. Those hips were made for
babes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha stumbled over an upraised paving stone and
just caught herself short of falling. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I will think on him,
when there is time,&rdquo; she said breathlessly. &ldquo;I have much to learn
yet, of being a Wise One, and Feran is <em>Seia Doon</em>, and the
Black Eyes have vowed not to sleep beneath roof or tent until
Couladin is dead.&rdquo; Couladin was <em>Seia Doon</em>.</p>

<p>The leathery-faced Wise One nodded as though
everything had been settled. &ldquo;You, young Aes Sedai. You know the
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> well, it is said. Will he do as he has
threatened? Hang even a clan chief?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that he will.&rdquo; More
quickly, Egwene added, &ldquo;But I am sure he can be brought to see
reason.&rdquo; She was not sure of any such thing, or even that it was
reason&mdash;what he had said sounded only just&mdash;but justice
would do him no good if he found the others turning against him as
well as the Shaido.</p>

<p>Sorilea glanced at her in surprise, then turned a
gaze on the chiefs around Rand&rsquo;s horse that should have knocked the
lot of them flat. &ldquo;You mistake me. He must show that mangy pack of
wolves that he is the chief wolf. A chief must be harder than other
men, young Aes Sedai, and the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> harder than other
chiefs. Every day a few more men, and even Maidens, are taken by
the bleakness, but they are the soft outer bark of the ironwood:
what remains is the hard inner core, and he must be hard to lead
them.&rdquo; Egwene noticed that she did not include herself or the other
Wise Ones among those who would be led. Muttering to herself about
&ldquo;mangy wolves,&rdquo; Sorilea strode ahead, and soon had all the Wise
Ones listening as they walked. Whatever she was saying, it did not
carry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is this Feran?&rdquo; Egwene asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard
you speak of him. What does he look like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frowning at Sorilea&rsquo;s back, more than half hidden by
the women clustered around her, Aviendha spoke absently. &ldquo;He looks
much like Rhuarc, only younger, taller and more handsome, with much
redder hair. For over a year he has been trying to attract Enaila&rsquo;s
interest, but I think she will teach him to sing before she gives
up the spear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. Do you mean to share him with
Enaila?&rdquo; It still felt odd, speaking so casually of that.</p>

<p>Aviendha stumbled again, and stared at her. &ldquo;Share
him? I want no part of him. His face is beautiful, but he laughs
like a braying mule and picks at his ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But from the way you talked to Sorilea, I thought
you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;liked him. Why didn&rsquo;t you tell her what you just told
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other woman&rsquo;s low laugh sounded pained. &ldquo;Egwene,
if she thought I was trying to balk in this, she would make the
bridal wreath herself and drag both Feran and me by the neck to be
wed. Have you ever seen anyone say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to Sorilea? Could you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene opened her mouth to say that of course she
could, and promptly closed it again. Making Nynaeve step back was
one thing, and trying the same with Sorilea quite another. It would
be like standing in the path of a landslide and telling it to
stop.</p>

<p>To change the subject, she said, &ldquo;I will speak to
Amys and the others for you.&rdquo; Not that she really thought it would
do much good now. The right time had been before it began. At least
Aviendha saw the impropriety of the situation finally. Perhaps&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;If we go to them together, I am sure they will listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Egwene. I must obey the Wise Ones. <em>
Ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em> requires it.&rdquo; Just as if she had not been asking for
intercession a moment earlier. Just as if she had not all but
begged the Wise Ones not to make her sleep in Rand&rsquo;s tent. &ldquo;But why
is my duty to the people never what I wish? Why must it be what I
would rather die before doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aviendha, no one is going to make you marry, or have
babies. Not even Sorilea.&rdquo; Egwene wished she had sounded a bit less
limp on that last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not understand,&rdquo; the other woman said softly,
&ldquo;and I cannot explain it to you.&rdquo; She gathered her shawl around her
and would not speak of it further. She was willing to discuss their
lessons, or whether Couladin would turn and give battle, or how
marriage had affected Melaine&mdash;who seemed to have to work at
being prickly now&mdash;or anything at all except what it was that
she could not, or would not, explain.</p>
