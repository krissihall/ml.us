<h4><em>Encounters in Samara</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
Whitecloaks at the gates gave Uno and Nynaeve no
more mind than they gave anyone else in the steady throng, which
was to say a cold suspicious stare, searching yet quick. Too many
people made anything else impossible, and maybe the scale-armored
guards did, too. Not that there was any reason for more except in
her mind. Her Great Serpent ring and Lan&rsquo;s heavy gold ring both
nestled in her pouch&mdash;the dress&rsquo;s low neckline meant she
could not wear them on the thong&mdash;but somehow she almost
expected Children of the Light to pick out a Tower-trained woman by
instinct. Her relief was palpable when those icy, unfeeling eyes
swept past her.</p>

<p>The soldiers paid the two of them as little attention&mdash;once she rearranged her shawl yet again. Uno&rsquo;s scowl might
have helped send their eyes back to the Whitecloaks, but the man
had no right to scowl in the first place. It was her business.</p>

<p>Rewrapping the folded length of gray wool one more
time, she tied the ends around her waist. The shawl defined her
bosom more than she wished, and still exposed a bit of cleavage,
yet it was a considerable improvement on the dress alone. At least
she would not have to worry about the shawl slipping again. If only
the thing were not so hot. The weather really should be turning
soon. They were not <em>that</em> far south of the Two Rivers.</p>

<p>Uno patiently waited on her for a change. She was of
two minds as to whether this was simple courtesy&mdash;his scarred
face looked a deal <em>too</em> patient&mdash;but finally they
walked together into Samara. Into chaos.</p>

<p>A babble of noise hung over everything, no one sound
distinguishable. People jammed the rough stone-paved streets all
but shoulder to shoulder from slate-roofed taverns to thatch-roofed
stables, from raucous inns with simple painted signs like The Blue
Bull or The Dancing Goose to shops where the signs had no words,
only a knife-and-scissors here, a bolt of cloth there, a
goldsmith&rsquo;s scales or a barber&rsquo;s razor, a pot or a lamp or a boot.
Nynaeve saw faces as pale as that of any Andorman and as dark as
that of any of the Sea Folk, some clean, some dirty, and coats with
high collars, low collars, no collars, drably colored and bright,
plain and embroidered, shabby and near new-made, in styles strange
as often as familiar. One fellow with a dark forked beard wore
silver chains across the chest of his plain blue coat, and two with
their hair in braids&mdash;<em>men</em>, with a black braid over
each ear below their shoulders!&mdash;had tiny brass bells sewn to
their red coatsleeves and the turned-down tops of thigh-high boots.
Whatever land they hailed from, those two were not fools; their
dark eyes were hard and searching as Uno&rsquo;s, and they carried curved
swords on their backs. A bare-chested man in a bright yellow sash,
skin a deeper brown than aged wood and hands intricately tattooed,
had to be one of the Sea Folk, though he wore neither earrings nor
nose ring.</p>

<p>The women were equally as diverse, hair ranging from
raven black to yellow so pale it was nearly white, braided or
gathered or hanging loose, cut short, to the shoulders, to the
waist, dresses in worn wool or neat linen or shimmering silk,
collars brushing chins with lace or embroidery and necklines every
bit as low as the one she hid. She even saw a copper-complexioned
Domani woman in a barely opaque red gown that covered her to the
neck and hid next to nothing! She wondered how safe that woman
would be after dark. Or in this broad daylight, for that
matter.</p>

<p>The occasional Whitecloaks and soldiers in that
milling mass seemed overwhelmed, struggling to make ground as hard
as anyone else. Oxcarts and horse-drawn wagons inched along the
haphazardly crisscrossing streets, bearers jostled sedan-chairs
through the crowds, and now and then a lacquered coach with a
plumed team of four or six made its laborious way, liveried footman
and steel-capped guards vainly trying to clear a path. Musicians
with flute or zither or bittern played at every corner where there
was not a juggler or an acrobat&mdash;their skill certainly
nothing to make Thom or the Chavanas worry&mdash;always with
another man or woman holding out a cap for coins. Ragged beggars
wove through it all, plucking at sleeves and proffering grimy
hands, and hawkers bustled with trays of everything from pins to
ribbons to pears, their cries lost in the din.</p>

<p>Her head spun by the time Uno drew her into a
narrower street where the throng seemed thinner, if only by
comparison. She paused to straighten her clothes, disarrayed from
plunging through the crowd, before following him. It was a trifle
quieter here, too. No street entertainers, and fewer hawkers and
beggars. Beggars kept clear of Uno, even after he tossed a few
coppers to a wary pack of urchins, for which she did not blame
them. The man just did not look&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;charitable.</p>

<p>The town&rsquo;s buildings loomed over these narrow ways,
despite being only two or three stories, putting the streets
themselves in shadow. But there was good light in the sky, hours
yet till dusk. Still plenty of time to get back to the show. If she
had to. With luck, they could all be boarding a riverboat by
sunset.</p>

<p>She gave a start when another Shienaran suddenly
joined them, sword on his back and head shaven but for that
topknot, a dark-haired man only a few years older than she. Uno
gave curt introductions and explanation without slowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace favor you, Nynaeve,&rdquo; Ragan said, the skin of
his dark cheek dimpling around a triangular white scar. Even
smiling, his face was hard; she had never met a soft Shienaran.
Soft men did not survive along the Blight, nor soft women either.
&ldquo;I remember you. Your hair was different, was it not? No matter.
Never fear. We will see you safely to Masema and to wherever you
would go after. Just be sure not to mention Tar Valon to him.&rdquo; No
one was sparing them a second glance, but he lowered his voice
anyway. &ldquo;Masema thinks the Tower will try to control the Lord
Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve shook her head. Another fool man who was
going to take care of her. At least he did not try to engage her in
conversation; the mood she was in, she would have given him the
rough side of her tongue if he so much as commented on the heat.
Her own face felt a trifle damp, and no wonder, having to wear a
shawl in this weather. Abruptly she remembered what the one-eyed
man had said concerning Ragan&rsquo;s opinion of her tongue. She did not
think she more than glanced at him, but Ragan moved to the other
side of Uno as if for shelter and eyed her warily. Men!</p>

<p>The streets grew still narrower, and though the stone
buildings lining them did not grow smaller, it was more often than
not the backs of the buildings they saw, and rough gray walls that
could hide only small yards. Eventually they turned down an alley
barely wide enough for all three of them abreast. At the far end, a
lacquered and gilded coach stood surrounded by scale-armored men.
More immediately, halfway between her and the coach, fellows
lounged thickly along both sides of the alley. In a motley of
coats, most clutched clubs or spears or swords as different as
their garb. They could have been a pack of street toughs, but
neither of the Shienarans slowed, so she did not either.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The street out front will be full of bloody fools
hoping to catch a glimpse of Masema at a bloody window.&rdquo; Uno&rsquo;s
voice was pitched for her ears alone. &ldquo;The only way to get in is by
the back.&rdquo; He fell silent as they came close enough for the waiting
men to hear.</p>

<p>Two of those were soldiers with rimmed steel helmets
and scaled tunics, swords at hip and spears in hand, but it was the
others who studied the three newcomers and fingered their weapons.
They had disturbing eyes, too intent, almost feverish. For once,
she would have been pleased to see an honest leer. These men did
not care whether she was a woman or a horse.</p>

<p>Without a word Uno and Ragan unfastened the
scabbarded blades from their backs and handed them and their
daggers to a plump-faced man who might have been a shopkeeper once,
from the look of his blue woolen coat and breeches. The clothing
had been good; it was clean, but heavily worn, and wrinkled as if
it had been slept in for a month. Plainly he recognized the
Shienarans, and though he frowned at her for a moment, especially
at her belt knife, he silently nodded to a narrow wooden gate in
the stone wall. That was perhaps the most off-putting fact of all;
none of them made a sound.</p>

<p>On the other side of wall was a small yard where
weeds stuck up between cobblestones. The tall stone house&mdash;three broad, pale-gray stories, with wide windows and scroll-worked
eaves and gables, roofed in dark red tiles&mdash;must have been
one of the finest in Samara. Once the gate was closed behind them,
Ragan spoke softly. &ldquo;There have been attempts to kill the
Prophet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took Nynaeve a moment to realize that he was
explaining why their weapons had been taken. &ldquo;But you are his
friends,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;You all followed Rand to Falme together.&rdquo;
She was not about to start calling him the Lord Dragon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re bloody let in at all,&rdquo; Uno said
dryly. &ldquo;I told you we don&rsquo;t see everything the way&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the
Prophet does.&rdquo; The slight pause, and the quick half-glance back at
the gate to see if anyone was listening, spoke volumes. It had been
Masema, before. And Uno was clearly a man who did not temper his
tongue easily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just watch what you say for once,&rdquo; Ragan told her,
&ldquo;and likely you will get the help you want.&rdquo; She nodded, as
agreeably as anyone could wish&mdash;she knew sense when she heard
it, even if he had no right to offer it&mdash;and he and Uno
exchanged doubtful glances. She was going to stuff these two into a
sack with Thom and Juilin and switch anything that stuck up.</p>

<p>Fine house as it might be, the kitchen was dusty, and
empty except for one bony, gray-haired woman, her drab gray dress
and white apron the only clean things in sight as they walked
through. Sucking her teeth, the old woman hardly glanced up from
stirring a small kettle of soup over a tiny blaze in one of the
wide stone fireplaces. Two battered pots hung on hooks where twenty
could have, and, a cracked pottery bowl on a blue-lacquered tray
stood on the broad table.</p>

<p>Beyond the kitchen, moderately fine hangings
decorated the walls. Nynaeve had developed something of an eye in
the last year, and these scenes of feasts and hunts for deer and
bear and boar were only good, not excellent. Chairs and tables and
chests lined the halls, dark lacquer streaked with red, inlaid with
mother-of-pearl. Hangings and furniture alike were also dusty, and
the red-and-white tiled floor had had only a halfhearted lick with
a broom. Cobwebs decorated the corners and cornices of the high
plaster ceiling.</p>

<p>There were no other servants&mdash;or anyone else&mdash;in sight until they came to a weedy fellow sitting on the
floor beside an open door, his grimy red silk coat much too large
for him and at odds with a filthy shirt and worn woolen breeches.
One of his cracked boots had a large hole in the sole; a toe poked
through another in the other one. He held up a hand, whispering,
&ldquo;The Light shine on you, and praise the name of the Lord Dragon?&rdquo;
He made it sound a question, querulously twisting a narrow face as
unwashed as his shirt, but then he did the same with everything.
&ldquo;The Prophet can&rsquo;t be disturbed now? He&rsquo;s busy? You&rsquo;ll have to wait
a bit?&rdquo; Uno nodded patiently, and Ragan leaned against the wall;
they had been through this before.</p>

<p>Nynaeve did not know what she had expected of the
Prophet, not even now that she was aware who he was, but certainly
not filth. That soup had smelled like cabbage and potatoes, hardly
the fare for a man who had an entire city dancing for him. And only
two servants, both of whom could well have come from the rudest
huts outside the city.</p>

<p>The skinny guard, if such he was&mdash;he had no
weapon; perhaps he was not trusted either&mdash;seemed to have no
objection when she moved to where she could see through the
doorway. The man and woman inside could not have been more
different. Masema had shaved even his topknot, and his coat was
plain brown wool, heavily wrinkled but clean, although his
knee-high boots were scuffed. Deep-set eyes turned his permanently
sour look to a scowl, and a scar made a pale triangle on his dark
cheek, a near mirror image of Ragan&rsquo;s, only more faded with age and
a hair nearer the eye. The woman, in elegantly gold-embroidered
blue silk, was short of her middle years and quite lovely despite a
nose perhaps too long for beauty. A simple blue net cap gathered
dark hair spilling almost to her waist, but she wore a broad
necklace of gold and firedrops with a matching bracelet, and gemmed
rings decorated nearly every finger. Where Masema seemed poised to
rush at something, teeth bared, she bore herself with stately
reserve and grace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;so many follow wherever you go,&rdquo; she was
saying, &ldquo;that order flies over the wall when you arrive. People are
not safe in themselves or their property&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord Dragon has broken all bonds of law, all
bonds made by mortal men and women.&rdquo; Masema&rsquo;s voice was heated, but
intense, not angry. &ldquo;The Prophecies say that the Lord Dragon will
break all chains that bind, and it is so. The Lord Dragon&rsquo;s
radiance will protect us against the Shadow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not the Shadow that threatens here, but
cutpurses and slipfingers and headcrackers. Some who follow you&mdash;many&mdash;believe that they can take what they wish from
whoever has it without payment or leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is justice in the hereafter, when we are born
again. Concern with things of this world is useless. But very well.
If you wish earthly justice&rdquo;&mdash;his lip curled contemptuously&mdash;&ldquo;let it be this. Henceforth, a man who steals will have his
right hand cut off. A man who interferes with a woman, or insults
her honor, or commits murder will be hung. A woman who steals or
commits murder will be flogged. If any accuses and finds twelve who
will agree, it will be done. Let it be so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, of course,&rdquo; the woman murmured. Aloof
elegance remained on her face, but she sounded shaken. Nynaeve did
not know how Ghealdanin law ran, but she did not think it could be
so casual as that. The woman took a deep breath. &ldquo;There is still
the matter of food. It becomes difficult to feed so many.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every man, woman and child who has come to the Lord
Dragon must have a full belly. It must be so! Where gold can be
found, food can be found, and there is too much gold in the world.
Too much concern with gold.&rdquo; Masema&rsquo;s head swung angrily. Not angry
with her, but in general. He looked to be searching for those who
concerned themselves with gold so he could unleash fury on their
heads. &ldquo;The Lord Dragon has been Reborn. The Shadow hangs over the
world, and only the Lord Dragon can save us. Only belief in the
Lord Dragon, submission and obedience to the word of the Lord
Dragon. All else is useless, even where it is not blasphemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blessed be the name of the Lord Dragon in the
Light.&rdquo; It had the sound of a rote reply. &ldquo;It is no longer simply a
matter of gold, my Lord Prophet. Finding and transporting food in
sufficient&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a lord,&rdquo; he broke in again, and now he was
angry. He leaned toward the woman, spittle on his lips, and though
her face did not change, her hands twitched as if they wanted to
clutch her dress. &ldquo;There is no lord but the Lord Dragon, in whom
the Light dwells, and I am but one humble voice of the Lord Dragon.
Remember that! High or low, blasphemers earn the scourge!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; the begemmed woman murmured, spreading
her skirts in a curtsy fit for a queen&rsquo;s court. &ldquo;It is as you say,
of course. There is no lord save the Lord Dragon, and I am but a
humble follower of the Lord Dragon&mdash;blessed be the name of
the Lord Dragon&mdash;who comes to hear the wisdom and guidance of
the Prophet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, Masema
was suddenly cold. &ldquo;You wear too much gold. Do not let earthly
possession seduce you. Gold is dross. The Lord Dragon is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Immediately she began plucking rings from her
fingers, and before the second was off, the weedy fellow scurried
to her side, pulling a pouch from his coat pocket and holding it
for her to drop them in. The bracelet and necklace followed as
well.</p>

<p>Nynaeve looked at Uno and raised an eyebrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every penny goes to the poor,&rdquo; he told her in a low
voice that barely reached her ear, &ldquo;or somebody who needs it. If
some merchant hadn&rsquo;t bloody given him her house, he&rsquo;d be in a
bloody stable, or one of those huts outside the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even his food comes as a gift,&rdquo; Ragan said just as
quietly. &ldquo;They used to bring him dishes fit for a king, until they
learned he just gave away everything but a little bread, and soup
or stew. He hardly drinks wine, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve shook her head. She supposed it was one way
to find money for the poor. Simply rob anyone who was <em>not</em>
poor. Of course, that would just make everyone poor in the end, but
it might work for a time. She wondered if Uno and Ragan knew the
whole of it. People who claimed they were collecting money to help
others often had a way of letting a good bit stick in their own
pockets, or else they liked the power that spreading it about gave
them, liked it far too much. She had better feeling for the man who
freely gave one copper from his own purse than for the fellow who
wrested a gold crown from someone else&rsquo;s. And less for fools who
abandoned their farms and shops to follow this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;this <em>
Prophet</em>, with no idea where their next meal would come
from.</p>

<p>Inside the room, the woman curtsied to Masema even
more deeply than before, spreading her skirts wide and bowing her
head. &ldquo;Until I once again have the honor of the Prophet&rsquo;s words and
counsel. The name of the Lord Dragon be blessed in the Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Masema waved her away absently, already half
forgotten. He had seen them in the hall, and was looking at them
with as close to pleasure as his dour face could come. It was not
very close. The woman swept out, not even appearing to see Nynaeve
or the two men. Nynaeve sniffed as the weedy fellow in the red coat
waved anxiously for them to come in. For someone who had just given
up her jewelry on demand, that woman managed a fine queenly
air.</p>

<p>The skinny man scampered back to his place by the
door as the other three men shook hands in the Borderlands fashion,
gripping forearms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace favor your sword,&rdquo; Uno said, echoed by
Ragan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace favor the Lord Dragon&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;and his
Light illumine us all.&rdquo; Nynaeve&rsquo;s breath caught. There was no doubt
to his meaning; the <em>Lord Dragon</em> was the source of the
Light. And he had the nerve to speak of blasphemy from others!
&ldquo;Have you come to the Light at last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We walk in the Light,&rdquo; Ragan said carefully. &ldquo;As
always.&rdquo; Uno kept silent, his face blank.</p>

<p>Weary patience made an odd play on Masema&rsquo;s sour
features. &ldquo;There is no way to the Light save through the Lord
Dragon. You will see the way and the truth in the end, for you have
seen the Lord Dragon, and only those whose souls are swallowed in
the Shadow can see and not believe. You are not such. You will
believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of the heat and the wool shawl, goose bumps
crawled along Nynaeve&rsquo;s arms. Total conviction filled the man&rsquo;s
voice, and this close she could see a glint in his nearly black
eyes that bordered on madness. He swept those eyes over her, and
she stiffened her knees. He made the most rabid Whitecloak she had
ever seen appear mild. Those fellows in the alley were only a pale
imitation of their master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, woman. Are you ready to come to the Light of
the Lord Dragon, abandoning sin and flesh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I walk in the Light as best I can.&rdquo; She was
irritated to find herself speaking as carefully as Ragan. Sin? Who
did he think he was?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are too concerned with the flesh.&rdquo; Masema&rsquo;s gaze
was withering as it swept over her red dress and the shawl wrapped
tightly around her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what do you mean by that?&rdquo; Uno&rsquo;s eye widened in
startlement, and Ragan made small shushing motions, yet she could
as soon have flown as stopped. &ldquo;Do you think you have a right to
tell me how to dress?&rdquo; Before she quite realized what she was
doing, she had untied the shawl and looped it over her elbows; it
really was much too hot, anyway. &ldquo;<em>No</em> man has that right,
for me or any other woman! If I chose to go <em>naked</em>, it
would be none of your concern!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Masema contemplated her bosom for a moment&mdash;not
so much as a hint of admiration lit his deep eyes, only acid
contempt&mdash;then raised that stare to her face. Uno&rsquo;s real eye
and painted made a perfect match, scowling at nothing, and Ragan
winced, surely muttering to himself inside his head.</p>

<p>Nynaeve swallowed hard. So much for guarding her
tongue. For perhaps the first time in her life, she truly regretted
speaking her mind without thinking first. If this man could order
men&rsquo;s hands cut off, order men hung, with only a jack-fool excuse
of a trial, what was he not capable of? She thought she was angry
enough to channel.</p>

<p>But if she did&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;If Moghedien or any Black
sisters <em>were</em> in Samara&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>But if I don&rsquo;t</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! She wanted very much to wrap the shawl back around her, up to
her chin. But not with him staring at her. Something in the back of
her mind shouted at her not to be a complete wool-head&mdash;only
men let pride overcome sense&mdash;but she met Masema&rsquo;s gaze
defiantly, even if she did have to stop herself from swallowing
again.</p>

<p>His lip curled. &ldquo;Such garments are worn to entice
men, and for no other reason.&rdquo; She could not understand
how his voice could be so fervent and so icy at the, same time.
&ldquo;Thoughts of the flesh distract the mind from the Lord Dragon and
the Light. I have considered banning dresses that distract men&rsquo;s
eyes, and minds. Let women who would waste time in attracting men,
and men who would attract women, be scourged until they know that
only in perfect contemplation of the Lord Dragon and the Light can
joy be found.&rdquo; He was not really looking at her any longer. That
dark burning stare looked through her, to something distant. &ldquo;Let
taverns, and places that sell strong drink, and all places that
would take the minds of people from that perfect contemplation, be
closed and burned to the ground. I frequented such places in my
days of sin, but now I heartily regret, as all should regret their
transgressions. There is only the Lord Dragon and the Light! All
else is illusion, a snare set by the Shadow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara,&rdquo; Uno said quickly into the
first pause for breath. &ldquo;From Emond&rsquo;s Field, in the Two Rivers,
whence the Lord Dragon comes.&rdquo; Masema&rsquo;s head turned slowly to the
one-eyed man, and she hastily took the opportunity to re-do the
shawl as she had had it. &ldquo;She was at Fal Dara with the Lord Dragon,
and at Falme. The Lord Dragon rescued her at Falme. The Lord Dragon
cares for her as for a mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another time, she would have given him a few choice
words, and maybe a well-boxed ear. Rand had not rescued her&mdash;or not exactly, anyway&mdash;and she was only a handful of years
older than he. A mother, indeed!</p>

<p>Masema turned back to her. The zealous light that had
burned in his eyes before was nothing to what was there now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;They almost glowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve. Yes.&rdquo; His voice quickened. &ldquo;Yes! I remember
your name, and your face. Blessed are you among women, Nynaeve
al&rsquo;Meara, none more so save the blessed mother of the Lord Dragon
herself, for you watched the Lord Dragon grow. You attended the
Lord Dragon as a child.&rdquo; He seized her arms, hard fingers biting in
painfully, but he seemed unaware of it. &ldquo;You will speak to the
crowds of the Lord Dragon&rsquo;s boyhood, of his first words of wisdom,
of the miracles that accompanied him. The Light has sent you here
to serve the Lord Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was not exactly sure what to say. There had never
been any miracles around Rand that <em>she</em> had seen. She had
<em>heard</em> of things, in Tear, but you could hardly call what a
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> caused miracles. Not really. Even what had
occurred at Falme had a rational explanation. Sort of. And as for
words of wisdom, the first she had heard out of him had been a
fervent promise never to throw a rock at anyone again, offered
after she had paddled his young backside for it. She did not
believe she had heard another word since that she could call wise.
In any case, if Rand had given sage advice from his cradle, if
there had been comets by night and apparitions in the sky by day,
she still would not have stayed with this madman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must travel downriver,&rdquo; she said guardedly. &ldquo;To
join him. The Lord Dragon.&rdquo; That name curdled on her tongue, so
soon after her promise to herself, but Rand was apparently never
anything as simple as &ldquo;he&rdquo; around the Prophet. <em>I am just being
sensible. That&rsquo;s all it is</em>. &ldquo;A man is an oak, a woman a
willow,&rdquo; the saying ran. The oak fought the wind and was broken,
while the willow bent when it must and survived. That did not mean
she had to like bending. &ldquo;He&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Lord Dragon&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;is in
Tear. The Lord Dragon has summoned me there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tear.&rdquo; Masema took his hands away, and she
surreptitiously rubbed her arms. She did not have to try hiding it,
though; he was staring at something beyond sight again. &ldquo;Yes, I
have heard.&rdquo; Speaking to something beyond sight, too, or to
himself. &ldquo;When Amadicia has come to the Lord Dragon as Ghealdan
has, I will lead the people to Tear, to bask in the radiance of the
Lord Dragon. I will send disciples to spread the word of the Lord
Dragon throughout Tarabon and Arad Doman, to Saldaea and Kandor and
the Borderlands, to Andor, and I will lead the people to kneel at
the Lord Dragon&rsquo;s feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wise plan&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;O Prophet of the Lord
Dragon.&rdquo; A fool plan if she had ever heard one. That was not to say
it would not work. Fool plans often did, for some reason, when men
made them. Rand might even enjoy having all those people kneel to
him, if he was half as arrogant as Egwene claimed. &ldquo;But we&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I
cannot wait. I have been summoned, and when the Lord Dragon
summons, mere mortals must obey.&rdquo; Some day she was going to get a
chance to box Rand&rsquo;s head for her need to do this! &ldquo;I have to find
a boat going downriver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Masema stared at her for so long that she began to
grow nervous. Sweat trickled down her back, and between her
breasts, and it was only partly the heat. That stare would have
made Moghedien sweat.</p>

<p>Finally he nodded, fiery zealotry fading to leave
only his usual dour scowl. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;If you have been
summoned, you must go. Go with the Light, and in the Light. Dress
more appropriately&mdash;those who have been close to the Lord
Dragon must be virtuous above all others&mdash;and meditate on the
Lord Dragon and his Light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A riverboat?&rdquo; Nynaeve insisted. &ldquo;You must know
whenever a boat reaches Samara, or any village along the river. If
you could just tell me where I might find one, it would make my
journey much&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;swifter.&rdquo; She had been going to say &ldquo;easier,&rdquo;
but she did not think ease mattered much to Masema.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not concern myself with such things,&rdquo; he said
testily. &ldquo;But you are right. When the Lord Dragon commands, you
must come on the hour. I will ask. If a vessel can be found,
someone will tell me of it eventually.&rdquo; His eyes shifted to the
other two men. &ldquo;You must see that she is safe until then. If she
persists in clothing herself in this manner, she will attract men
with vile thoughts. She must be protected, like a wayward child,
until she is reunited with the Lord Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve bit her tongue. A willow, not an oak, when a
willow was needed. She managed to mask her irritation behind a
smile that had to carry all the gratitude the idiot man could wish.
A dangerous idiot, however. She had to remember that.</p>

<p>Uno and Ragan made their goodbyes quickly, with more
forearm clasping, and hustled her out, one on either arm, as if
they thought it necessary to hurry her away from Masema for some
reason. Masema appeared to have forgotten them before they reached
the door; he was already frowning at the weedy man, waiting next to
a bluff fellow in a farmer&rsquo;s coat who was crumpling his cap in
thick hands, awe painted across his broad face.</p>

<p>She did not say a word as they retraced their steps
through the kitchen, where the gray-haired woman was sucking her
teeth and stirring the soup as if she had not moved in the
interval. Nynaeve held her tongue while they retrieved their
weapons, held it until they were out of the alleyway, into
something approaching the width of a street. Then she rounded on
them, shaking her finger under each nose alternately. &ldquo;How dare you
<em>drag</em> me out like that!&rdquo; People passing by grinned&mdash;men ruefully, women appreciatively&mdash;though none could have
had an idea what she was berating them over. &ldquo;Another five minutes,
and I would have had him finding a boat today! If you ever lay
hands on me again&mdash;!&rdquo; Uno snorted so loudly that she cut off
with a start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another five bloody minutes, and Masema would have
bloody well laid hands on <em>you</em>. Or rather, he&rsquo;d have said
that someone should, and then someone flaming well would have! When
he says something should be done, there are always fifty flaming
hands, or a hundred, or a flaming thousand if need be, to do it!&rdquo;
He stalked off down the street, Ragan at his side, and she had to
go with them or be left. Uno paced on as if he knew she would trail
after. She almost went the other way just to prove him wrong.
Following had nothing to do with fear of getting lost in that
rabbit warren of streets. She could have found her way out.
Eventually. &ldquo;He had a flaming Lord of the Crown High Council
flogged&mdash;flogged!&mdash;for half the heat in his voice that
you had,&rdquo; the one-eyed man growled. &ldquo;Contempt for the word of the
Lord Dragon, he called it. Peace! Demanding what bloody right he
had to comment on your flaming clothes! For a few minutes you did
well enough, but I saw your face there at the end. You were ready
to flaming lace into him again. The only thing worse you could have
done would be to bloody name the Lord Dragon. He calls that
blasphemy. As well name the flaming Dark One.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ragan&rsquo;s topknot bobbed as he nodded. &ldquo;Remember the
Lady Baelome, Uno? Right after the first rumors came from Tear
naming the Lord Dragon, Nynaeve, she said something about &lsquo;this
Rand al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo; in Masema&rsquo;s hearing, and he called for an axe and a
chopping block without pause for breath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had someone beheaded for <em>that</em>?&rdquo; she said
incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Uno muttered in disgust. &ldquo;But only because she
bloody well groveled when she realized he flaming meant it. She was
dragged out and hung up by her flaming wrists from the back of her
own coach, then strapped the bloody length of whatever village it
was we were in then. Her own flaming retainers stood like a bunch
of sheep-gutted farmers and watched it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When it was done,&rdquo; Ragan added, &ldquo;she thanked Masema
for his mercy, the same as Lord Aleshin did.&rdquo; His tone had too much
pointedness to suit her; he was delivering a moral, and intended
her to take it in. &ldquo;They had reason, Nynaeve. Theirs would not have
been the first heads he has put on a stake. Yours could have been
the latest. And ours with it, if we tried to give aid. Masema plays
no favorites.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She drew breath. How could Masema have all this
power? And not only among his own followers, apparently. But then,
there was no reason lords or ladies could be not as great fools as
any farmer; a good many were greater, in her estimation. That idiot
woman with her rings had surely been a lady; no merchant ever wore
firedrops. Yet surely Ghealdan had laws and courts and judges.
Where was the queen, or the king? She could not remember which
Ghealdan had. No one in the Two Rivers had ever had much truck with
kings or queens, yet that was what they were for, them and lords
and ladies, seeing justice fairly done. But whatever Masema did
here was no concern of hers. She had more important problems than
worrying over a flock of imbeciles who let a madman trample
them.</p>

<p>Still, curiosity made her say, &ldquo;Does he mean that
about trying to stop men and women looking at one another? What
does he think will happen if there are no marriages, no children?
Will he stop people farming next, or weaving or making shoes, so
they can think about Rand al&rsquo;Thor?&rdquo; She enunciated the name
deliberately. These two went around calling him &ldquo;the Lord Dragon&rdquo;
at the drop of a pin almost as much as Masema did. &ldquo;I will tell you
this. If he tries telling women how to dress, he <em>will</em>
start a riot. Against him.&rdquo; Samara must have something like a
Women&rsquo;s Circle&mdash;most places did, even if they called it
something else, even when it was not a formal arrangement at all;
there were some things men just did not have the sense to see to&mdash;and they surely could and did call women down for wearing
inappropriate clothes, but that was not the same as a man putting
his finger into it. Women did not meddle in men&rsquo;s affairs&mdash;well, no more than was necessary&mdash;and men should not meddle
in women&rsquo;s. &ldquo;And I expect the men will react no better if he tries
closing taverns and the like. I never knew a man yet who wouldn&rsquo;t
cry himself to sleep if he could not put his nose in a mug now and
then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he will,&rdquo; Ragan said, &ldquo;and maybe he won&rsquo;t.
Sometimes he orders things, and sometimes he forgets, or puts it
off anyway, because something more important comes along. You would
be surprised,&rdquo; he added dryly, &ldquo;at what his followers will accept
from him without a whimper.&rdquo; He and Uno were flanking her, she
realized, and watching the other folk in the street warily. Even to
her, the pair of them appeared ready to draw swords in a heartbeat.
If they actually thought to carry out Masema&rsquo;s instructions, they
had another think coming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t against bloody marriage,&rdquo; Uno growled,
staring so hard at a peddler with meat pies on a tray that the man
turned and ran without taking the coins from two women holding pies
in their hands. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky he did not remember you have no
husband, or he might have sent you to the Lord Dragon with one.
Sometimes he picks out three or four hundred unmarried men and as
many women, and flaming well marries them. Most have never seen
each other before that day. If the pigeon-gutted dirt-grubbers
don&rsquo;t bloody complain about that, do you think they&rsquo;ll open their
flaming mouths about ale?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ragan muttered something under his breath, but she
caught enough to narrow her eyes. &ldquo;Some man doesn&rsquo;t know how bloody
lucky <em>he</em> is.&rdquo; That was what he had said. He did not even
notice her glare. He was too busy scanning the street, watching
against someone who might try to abscond with her like a pig in a
sack. She was half tempted to take off the shawl and throw it away.
He did not seem to hear her sniff, either. Men could be
insufferably blind and deaf when they wished to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least he didn&rsquo;t try to steal my jewelry,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Who was that fool woman who gave him hers?&rdquo; She could not
have much sense if she had become one of Masema&rsquo;s followers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Uno said, &ldquo;was Alliandre, Blessed of the
Light, Queen of bloody Ghealdan. And a dozen more titles, the way
you southlanders like to pile them up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve stubbed her toe on a cobblestone and almost
fell. &ldquo;So that is how he does it,&rdquo; she exclaimed, shaking off their
helping hands. &ldquo;If the <em>queen</em> is fool enough to listen to
him, no wonder he can do whatever he wants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a fool,&rdquo; Uno said sharply, flashing a frown at
her before returning to watching the street. &ldquo;A wise woman. When
you bloody find yourself straddling a wild horse, you bloody well
ride it the way it&rsquo;s bloody going, if you&rsquo;re smart enough to pour
water out of a bloody boot. You think she&rsquo;s a fool because Masema
took her rings? She&rsquo;s flaming smart enough to know he might demand
more if she stopped wearing jewelry when she comes to him. The
first time, he went to her&mdash;been the other way round, since&mdash;and he <em>did</em> take the rings right off her flaming
fingers. She had strands of pearls in her hair, and he broke the
strings pulling them out. All of her ladies-in-waiting were down on
their knees gathering the bloody things off the floor. Alliandre
even picked up a few herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound so wise to me,&rdquo; she said stoutly.
&ldquo;It sounds like cowardice.&rdquo; <em>Whose knees were shaking because he
looked at her?</em> a voice in her head asked. <em>Who was sweating
herself silly?</em> At least she had managed to face up to
him. <em>I did. Bending like a willow isn&rsquo;t the same as cowering
like a mouse</em>. &ldquo;Is she the queen, or isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men exchanged those irritating looks, and
Ragan said quietly, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand, Nynaeve. Alliandre is
the fourth to sit on the Light Blessed Throne since we came to
Ghealdan, and that&rsquo;s barely half a year. Johanin wore the crown
when Masema began attracting a few crowds, but he thought Masema a
harmless madman and did nothing even when the crowds grew and his
nobles told him he had to put an end to it. Johanin died in a
hunting accident&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hunting accident!&rdquo; Uno interjected, sneering. A
hawker who happened to be looking at him dropped his tray of pins
and needles. &ldquo;Not unless he didn&rsquo;t know one bloody end of a flaming
boar spear from the other. Flaming southlanders and their flaming
Game of Houses!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Ellizelle succeeded,&rdquo; Ragan took up. &ldquo;She had
the army dispersing the crowds, until finally there was a pitched
battle and it was the army that was chased off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bloody poor excuse for soldiers,&rdquo; Uno muttered. She
was going to have to speak to him about his language again.</p>

<p>Ragan nodded agreement, but went on with what he had
been saying. &ldquo;They say Ellizelle took poison after that, but
however she died, she was replaced by Teresia, who lasted a full
ten days after her coronation, just until she had a chance to send
two thousand soldiers against ten thousand folk who had gathered to
hear Masema outside Jehannah. After her soldiers were routed, she
abdicated to marry a rich merchant.&rdquo; Nynaeve stared at him
incredulously, and Uno snorted. &ldquo;That is what they say,&rdquo; the
younger man maintained. &ldquo;Of course, in this land, marrying a
commoner means giving up any claim to the throne forever, and
whatever Beron Goraed feels about having a pretty young wife with
royal blood, I hear he was dragged from his bed by a score of
Alliandre&rsquo;s retainers and hauled to Jheda Palace for a wedding in
the small hours of the morning. Teresia went off to live on her
husband&rsquo;s new country estate while Alliandre was being crowned, all
before sunrise, and the new queen summoned Masema to the palace to
tell him he would not be troubled again. Inside two weeks <em>
she</em> was calling on <em>him</em>. I do not know whether she
really believes what he preaches, but I know she took the throne of
a land on the edge of civil war, with Whitecloaks ready to move in,
and she stopped it the only way she could. That is a wise queen,
and a man could be proud to serve her, even if she is a
southlander.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve opened her mouth, and forgot what she was
going to say when Uno said, in a casual tone, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a flaming
Whitecloak following us. Don&rsquo;t look around, woman. You have more
bloody sense than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her neck stiffened with the effort of keeping her
eyes forward; prickles crawled up her back. &ldquo;Take the next turn,
Uno.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That carries us away from the main streets, and the
flaming gates. We can flaming lose him in the crowds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it!&rdquo; She inhaled slowly, made her
voice less shrill. &ldquo;I need a sight of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uno glowered so fiercely that people stepped out of
their way for ten paces ahead, but they turned down the next narrow
street. She shifted her head a trifle as they made the turn, just
enough to peek from the edge of her eye before the corner of a
small stone tavern cut off her view. The snowy cloak with the
flaring sun stood out among the thin crowd. There was no mistaking
that beautiful face, the face she had been sure she would see. No
other Whitecloak than Galad could have a reason to follow her, and
none to follow Uno or Ragan.</p>
