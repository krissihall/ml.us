<h4><em>Rhuidean</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">H</span>igh
in the city of Rhuidean, Rand al&rsquo;Thor looked out
from a tall window; whatever glass might have once been in it was
long since gone. The shadows below slanted sharply east. A
bard-harp played softly in the room behind him. Sweat evaporated
from his face almost as soon as it appeared; his red silk coat,
damp between the shoulders, hung open in a fruitless bid for air,
and his shirt was unlaced half down his chest. Night in the Aiel
Waste would bring freezing cold, but during daylight even a breeze
was never cool.</p>

<p>With his hands above his head on the smooth stone
window frame, his coatsleeves fell down to reveal the front part of
the figure wrapped around each forearm: a golden-maned, serpentine
creature with eyes like the sun, scaled in scarlet and gold, each
foot tipped with five golden claws. Part of his skin, they were not
tattoos; they glittered like precious metals and polished gems,
seemed almost alive in the late-afternoon sunlight.</p>

<p>Those marked him, to the people on this side of the
mountain range variously called the Dragonwall or the Spine of the
World, as He Who Comes With the Dawn. And like the herons branded
into his palms, they marked him for those beyond the Dragonwall,
too, according to the Prophecies, as the Dragon Reborn. In both
cases prophesied to unite, save&mdash;and destroy.</p>

<p>They were names he would have avoided if he could,
but that time was long past if it had ever existed, and he no
longer thought of it. Or if he did, on rare occasion, it was with
the faint regret of a man recalling a foolish dream of his boyhood.
As if he were not close enough to boyhood to remember every minute.
Instead, he tried to think only of what he had to do. Fate and duty
held him on the path like a rider&rsquo;s reins, but he had often been
called stubborn. The end of the road must be reached, but if it
could be attained by a different way, maybe it need not be the end.
Small chance. No chance, almost certainly. The Prophecies demanded
his blood.</p>

<p>Rhuidean stretched below him, seared by a sun still
pitiless as it sank toward craggy mountains, bleak, with barely a
sign of vegetation. This rugged, broken land, where men had killed
or died over a pool of water they could step across, was the last
place on earth anyone would think to find a great city. Its
long-ago builders had never finished their work. Impossibly tall
buildings dotted the city, stepped and slab-sided palaces that
sometimes ended after eight or even ten stories not with a roof but
with the ragged masonry of another half-built floor. The towers
soared higher yet, but stopped in jagged abruptness as often as
not. Now a good quarter of the great structures, with their massive
columns and immense windows of colored glass, lay strewn as rubble
across wide avenues with broad strips of bare dirt down their
centers, dirt that had never held the trees they were planned for.
The marvelous fountains stood dry as they had for hundreds upon
hundreds of years. All that futile labor, the builders finally
dying with their work undone; yet at times Rand thought that maybe
the city had only been begun so he could find it.</p>

<p><em>Too proud</em>, he thought. <em>A man would have
to be half-mad at least to be so proud</em>. He could not help
chuckling dryly. There had been Aes Sedai with the men and women
who had come here so long ago, and they had known <em>The Karaethon
Cycle</em>, the Prophecies of the Dragon. Or perhaps they had
written the Prophecies. <em>Too proud by tenfold</em>.</p>

<p>Directly below him lay a vast plaza, half-covered in
stretching shadow, littered with a jumble of statues and crystal
chairs, oddities and peculiar shapes of metal or glass or stone,
things he could put no name to, scattered about in tangled heaps as
if deposited by a storm. Even the shadows were cool only by
comparison. Rough-clothed men&mdash;not Aiel&mdash;sweated to
load wagons with items chosen by a short, slender woman in pristine
blue silk, straight-backed and gliding from place to place as
though the heat did not press down on her as hard as on the others.
Still, she wore a damp white cloth tied around her temples; she
just did not let herself show the effects of the sun. Rand would
have wagered she did not even perspire.</p>

<p>The workmen&rsquo;s leader was a dark, bulky man named
Hadnan Kadere, a supposed merchant dressed all in cream-colored
silk that was sweat-sodden today. He mopped his face continually
with a large handkerchief, shouting curses at the men&mdash;his
wagon drivers and guards&mdash;but he leaped as quickly as they to
haul at whatever the slim woman pointed out, big or small. Aes
Sedai had no need of size to impose their will, but Rand thought
Moiraine would have done as well if she had never been near the
White Tower.</p>

<p>Two of the men were trying to move what appeared to
be an oddly twisted redstone doorframe; the corners did not meet
properly, and the eye did not want to follow the straight pieces.
It stayed upright, turning freely but refusing to tip over however
they manhandled it. Then one slipped and fell, through the doorway
up to his waist. Rand tensed. For a moment, the fellow seemed not
to exist above the waist; his legs kicked wildly in panic. Until
Lan, a tall man in drab shades of green, strode over and hauled him
out again by his belt. Lan was Moiraine&rsquo;s Warder, bonded to her in
some way Rand did not understand, and a hard man who moved like the
Aiel, like a hunting wolf; the sword at his hip did not seem part
of him, it was part of him. He dropped the workman on the paving
stones on the seat of his breeches and left him there; the fellow&rsquo;s
terrified cries rose thinly to Rand, and his companion looked ready
to run. Several of Kadere&rsquo;s men who had been close enough to see
were looking at one another and at the mountains around the city,
plainly assessing their chances.</p>

<p>Moiraine appeared among them so quickly it seemed by
the Power, moving smoothly from man to man. Her manner made Rand
almost hear the cool, imperious instructions coming from her lips,
so full of certainty that they would be obeyed that not obeying
would seem foolish. In short order she overrode resistance, stamped
firmly on objections, chivvied them every one back to work. The
pair with the doorframe were soon dragging and shoving as hard as
ever, if with frequent looks at Moiraine when they thought she
would not see. In her own way, she was even harder than Lan.</p>

<p>As far as Rand knew, all of those things down there
were <em>angreal</em> or sa&rsquo;<em>angreal</em> or <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, made before the Breaking of the World to magnify
the One Power or use it in various ways. Made with the Power
certainly, though not even Aes Sedai knew how to construct such
things now. He more than suspected the use of the twisted doorframe&mdash;a doorway to another world&mdash;but for the rest, he had
no idea. No one did. That was why Moiraine worked so hard, to have
as many as she could carted to the Tower for study. It was possible
that even the Tower did not contain as many objects of the Power as
lay about this square, though supposedly the Tower held the largest
collection in the world. Even there, the Tower only knew the uses
of some.</p>

<p>What was in the wagons or tossed about on the
pavement did not interest Rand; he had already taken what he needed
from down there. Had already taken more than he wanted, in some
ways.</p>

<p>In the center of the plaza, near the burned remains
of a great tree a hundred feet high, stood a small forest of tall
glass columns, each nearly as tall as the tree and so slender it
seemed the first storm-wind must bring them all crashing down. Even
with an edge of shadow touching them, the columns caught and
refracted the sunlight in glitters and sparkles. For countless
years Aiel men had entered that array and returned marked as Rand
was, but on only one arm, marked as clan chiefs. They came out
marked or did not come out. Aiel women had come to this city as
well, on the path toward becoming Wise Ones. No one else, not and
live. <em>A man may go to Rhuidean once, a woman twice; more means
death</em>. That was what the Wise Ones had said, and it had been
truth, then. Now anyone could enter Rhuidean.</p>

<p>Hundreds of Aiel walked the streets, and increasing
numbers actually dwelled in the buildings; each day more of the
dirt strips down the streets showed beans or squash or <em>
zemai</em>, arduously watered from clay pots hauled from the huge
new lake that filled the south end of the valley, the only such
body of water in the entire land. Thousands made their camps in the
surrounding mountains, even on Chaendaer itself, where before they
had come only with ceremony, to send a single man or woman at a
time into Rhuidean.</p>

<p>Wherever he went, Rand brought change and
destruction. This time, he hoped against hope that the change was
for the good. It might yet be so. The burned tree mocked him. <em>
Avendesora</em>, the legendary Tree of Life; the stories never said
where it was, and it had been a surprise to find it here. Moiraine
said it still lived, that it would put out shoots again, but so far
he saw only blackened bark and bare branches.</p>

<p>With a sigh, he turned from the window into a big
room, though not the biggest in Rhuidean, with tall windows on two
sides, its domed ceiling worked in a fanciful mosaic of winged
people and animals. Most of the furniture left in the city had long
since rotted away even in the dryness, and much of the little that
remained was riddled with beetles and worms. But on the far side of
the room stood one high-backed chair, solid, and its gilding
largely intact, but mismatched with its table, a wide thing with
legs and edges thickly carved in flowers. Someone had polished the
wood with beeswax till it shone dully despite its age. The Aiel had
found them for him, though they shook their heads at such things;
there were few trees in the Waste that could have produced wood
straight and long enough to make that chair, and none to make the
table.</p>

<p>That was all the furniture, as he thought of it. A
fine silk Illianer carpet in blue and gold, booty in some long-ago
battle, covered the middle of the dark red floor tiles. Cushions
lay scattered about, in bright silks, and tasseled. Those were what
Aiel used instead of chairs, when they did not merely sit on their
heels, as comfortable as he would be in a padded chair.</p>

<p>Six men reclined against cushions on the carpet. Six
clan chiefs, representing the clans that had so far come to follow
Rand. Or rather, to follow He Who Comes With the Dawn. Not always
eagerly. He thought Rhuarc, a broad-shouldered, blue-eyed man with
heavy streaks of gray in his dark red hair, might have some
friendship for him, but not the rest. Only six of the twelve.</p>

<p>Ignoring the chair, Rand sat down cross-legged,
facing the Aiel. Outside of Rhuidean, the only chairs in the Waste
were chief&rsquo;s chairs, used only by the chief and only for three
reasons: to be acclaimed as clan chief, to accept the submission of
an enemy with honor, or to pass judgment. Taking the chair with
these men now would imply that he meant to do one of those.</p>

<p>They wore the <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em>, coats and breeches
in shades of brown and gray that would fade into the ground, and
soft boots that laced to the knee. Even here, meeting with the man
they had proclaimed the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, the chief of chiefs,
each had a heavy-bladed knife at his belt and the gray-brown <em>
shoufa</em> draped like a wide scarf around his neck; if any man
covered his face with the black veil that was part of the <em>
shoufa</em>, he would be ready to kill. It was not beyond
possibility. These men had fought one another in a never-ending
cycle of clan raids and battles and feuds. They watched him, waited
for him, but an Aiel&rsquo;s waiting always spoke of a readiness to move,
suddenly and violently.</p>

<p>Bael, the tallest man Rand had ever seen, and Jheran,
blade-slender and whip-quick, lay as far from one another as they
could manage and still be on the carpet. There was blood feud
between Bael&rsquo;s Goshien and Jheran&rsquo;s Shaarad, suppressed for He Who
Comes With the Dawn but not forgotten. And perhaps the Peace of
Rhuidean still held, despite all that had happened. Still, the
tranquil sounds of the harp made a sharp contrast with the hard
refusal of Bael and Jheran to look at one another. Six sets of
eyes, blue or green or gray, in sun-dark faces; Aiel could make
hawks look tame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What must I do to bring the Reyn to me?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You were sure they would come, Rhuarc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chief of the Taardad looked at him calmly; his
face could have been carved stone for all its expression. &ldquo;Wait.
Only that. Dhearic will bring them. Eventually.&rdquo;</p>

<p>White-haired Han, lying next to Rhuarc, twisted his
mouth as if about to spit. His leathery face wore a sour look, as
usual. &ldquo;Dhearic has seen too many men and Maidens sit staring for
days, then throw down their spears. Throw them down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And run away,&rdquo; Bael added quietly. &ldquo;I have seen them
myself, among the Goshien, even from my own sept, running. And you,
Han, among the Tomanelle. We all have. I do not think they know
where they are running to, only what they are running from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cowardly snakes,&rdquo; Jheran barked. Gray streaked his
light brown hair, there were no young men among Aiel clan chiefs.
&ldquo;Stinkadders, wriggling away from their own shadows.&rdquo; A slight
shift of his blue eyes toward the far side of the carpet made it
clear he meant it for a description of the Goshien, not just those
who had thrown down their spears.</p>

<p>Bael made as if to rise, his face hardening further,
if that was possible, but the man next to him put a quieting hand
on his arm. Bruan, of the Nakai, was big enough and strong enough
for two blacksmiths, but he had a placid nature that seemed odd for
an Aiel. &ldquo;All of us have seen men and Maidens run.&rdquo; He sounded
almost lazy, and his gray eyes looked so, yet Rand knew otherwise;
even Rhuarc considered Bruan a deadly fighter and a devious
tactician. Luckily, not even Rhuarc was stronger for Rand than
Bruan. But he had come to follow He Who Comes With the Dawn; he did
not know Rand al&rsquo;Thor. &ldquo;As you have, Jheran. You know how hard it
was to face what they face. If you cannot name coward those who
died because they could not face it, can you name coward those who
run for the same reason?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They should never have learned,&rdquo; Han muttered,
kneading his red-tasseled blue cushion like an enemy&rsquo;s throat. &ldquo;It
was for those who could enter Rhuidean and live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke the words to no one in particular, but they
had to be for Rand&rsquo;s ears. It was Rand who had revealed to everyone
what a man learned amid the glass columns in the plaza, revealed
enough that the chiefs and Wise Ones could not turn aside when
asked the rest. If there was an Aiel in the Waste who did not know
the truth now, he had not spoken to anyone in a month.</p>

<p>Far from the glorious heritage of battle most
believed in, the Aiel had begun as helpless refugees from the
Breaking of the World. Everyone who survived had been refugees
then, of course, but the Aiel had never seen themselves as
helpless. Worse, they had been followers of the Way of the Leaf,
refusing to do violence even in defense of their lives. Aiel meant
&ldquo;dedicated&rdquo; in the Old Tongue, and it had been to peace that they
were dedicated. Those who called themselves Aiel today were the
descendants of those who had broken a pledge of untold generations.
Only one remnant of that belief remained: an Aiel would die before
taking up a sword. They had always believed it a part of their
pride, of their separateness from those who lived outside the
Waste.</p>

<p>He had heard Aiel say that they had committed some
sin to be placed in the desolate Waste. Now they knew what it was.
The men and women who had built Rhuidean and died here&mdash;those
called the Jenn Aiel, the clan that was not, on the few occasions
they were spoken of&mdash;had been the ones who kept faith with
the Aes Sedai of the time before the Breaking. It was hard to face
the knowledge that what you had always believed was a lie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It had to be told,&rdquo; Rand said. <em>They had a right
to know. A man shouldn&rsquo;t have to live a lie. Their own prophecy
said I would break them. And I couldn&rsquo;t have done differently</em>.
The past was past and done; he should be worrying about the future.
<em>Some of these men dislike me, and some hate me for not being
born among them, but they follow. I need them all</em>. &ldquo;What of
the Miagoma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Erim, lying between Rhuarc and Han, shook his head.
His once bright red hair was half white, but his green eyes were as
strong as any younger man&rsquo;s. His big hands, wide and long and hard,
said his arms were as strong, too. &ldquo;Timolan does not let his feet
know which way he will jump until after he has leaped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Timolan was young as a chief,&rdquo; Jheran said, &ldquo;he
tried to unite the clans and failed. It will not sit well with him
that at last one has come to succeed where he failed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will come,&rdquo; Rhuarc said. &ldquo;Timolan never believed
himself He Who Comes With the Dawn. And Janwin will bring the
Shiande. But they will wait. They must settle matters in their own
minds first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must settle He Who Comes With the Dawn being a
wetlander,&rdquo; Han barked. &ldquo;I mean no offense, <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>.&rdquo;
There was no obsequiousness in his voice; a chief was not a king,
and neither was the chief of chiefs. At best he was first among
equals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Daryne and the Codarra will come eventually, as
well, I think,&rdquo; Bruan said calmly. And quickly, lest silence should
grow to a reason for dancing the spears. First among equals at
best. &ldquo;They have lost more than any other clans to the bleakness.&rdquo;
That was what the Aiel had taken to calling the long period of
staring before someone tried to run away from being Aiel. &ldquo;For the
moment, Mandelain and Indirian are concerned with holding their
clans together, and both will want to see the Dragons on your arms
for themselves, but they will come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That left only one clan to be discussed, the one none
of the chiefs wanted to mention. &ldquo;What news of Couladin and the
Shaido?&rdquo; Rand asked.</p>

<p>Silence answered him, broken only by the softly
serene sounds of the harp in the background, each man waiting for
another to speak, all coming as close as Aiel could to showing
discomfort. Jheran frowned at his thumbnail, and Bruan toyed with
one of the silvery tassels on his green cushion. Even Rhuarc
studied the carpet.</p>

<p>Graceful, white-robed men and women moved into the
hush, pouring worked silver goblets of wine to set beside each man,
bringing small silver plates with olives, rare in the Waste, and
white ewe&rsquo;s-milk cheese, and the pale, wrinkled nuts the Aiel
called <em>pecara</em>. The Aiel faces looking out of those pale
cowls had downcast eyes and an unfamiliar meekness on their
features.</p>

<p>Whether captured in battle or on a raid, the <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em> were sworn to serve obediently for one year and a
day, touching no weapon, doing no violence, at the end returning to
their own clan and sept as if nothing had happened. A strange echo
of the Way of the Leaf. <em>Ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>, honor and obligation,
required it, and breaking <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em> was nearly the worst
thing an Aiel could do. Perhaps the worst. It was possible that
some of these men and women were serving their own clan chief, but
neither would acknowledge it by the blink of an eye so long as the
period of <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> held, not even for a son or
daughter.</p>

<p>It struck Rand suddenly that this was the real reason
that some Aiel took what he had revealed so hard. To those, it must
seem that their ancestors had sworn <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, not only
for themselves but for all succeeding generations. And those
generations&mdash;all, down to the present day&mdash;had broken
<em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em> by taking up the spear. Had the men in front of
him ever worried along those lines? <em>Ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em> was very
serious business to an Aiel.</p>

<p>The <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> departed on soft slippered
feet, barely making a sound. None of the clan chiefs touched their
wine, or the food.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any hope that Couladin will meet with me?&rdquo;
Rand knew there was not; he had stopped sending requests for a
meeting once he learned Couladin was having the messengers skinned
alive. But it was a way to start the others talking.</p>

<p>Han snorted. &ldquo;The only word we have had from him is
that he means to flay <em>you</em> when next he sees you. Does that
sound as if he will talk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I break the Shaido away from him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They follow him,&rdquo; Rhuarc said. &ldquo;He is not a chief at
all, but they believe he is.&rdquo; Couladin had never entered those
glass columns; he might even still believe as he claimed, that
everything Rand had said was a lie. &ldquo;He says that he is the <em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, and they believe that as well. The Shaido Maidens
who came, came for their society, and that because <em>Far Dareis
Mai</em> carried your honor. None else will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We send scouts to watch them,&rdquo; Bruan said, &ldquo;and the
Shaido kill them when they can&mdash;Couladin builds the makings
of half a dozen feuds&mdash;but so far he shows no signs of
attacking us here. I have heard that he claims we have defiled
Rhuidean, and that attacking us here would only deepen the
desecration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Erim grunted and shifted on his cushion. &ldquo;He means
there are enough spears here to kill every Shaido twice over and to
spare.&rdquo; He popped a piece of white cheese into his mouth, growling
around it. &ldquo;The Shaido were ever cowards and thieves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honorless dogs,&rdquo; Bael and Jheran said together, then
stared at one another as though each thought the other had tricked
him into something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honorless or not,&rdquo; Bruan said quietly, &ldquo;Couladin&rsquo;s
numbers are growing.&rdquo; Calm as he sounded, he still took a deep
drink from his goblet before going on. &ldquo;You all know what I am
speaking of. Some of those who run, after the bleakness, do not
throw away their spears. Instead they join with their societies
among the Shaido.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No Tomanelle has ever broken clan,&rdquo; Han barked.</p>

<p>Bruan looked past Rhuarc and Erim at the Tomanelle
chief and said deliberately, &ldquo;It has happened in every clan.&rdquo;
Without waiting for another challenge to his word, he settled back
on his cushion. &ldquo;It cannot be called breaking clan. They join their
societies. Like the Shaido Maidens who have come to their Roof
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were a few mutters, but no one disputed him
this time. The rules governing Aiel warrior societies were complex,
and in some ways their members felt as closely bound to society as
to clan. For instance, members of the same society would not fight
each other even if their clans were in blood feud. Some men would
not marry a woman too closely related to a member of their own
society, just as if that made her their own close blood kin. The
ways of <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>, the Maidens of the Spear, Rand did
not even want to think about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need to know what Couladin intends,&rdquo; he told them.
Couladin was a bull with a bee in his ear; he might charge in any
direction. Rand hesitated. &ldquo;Would it violate honor to send people
to join their societies among the Shaido?&rdquo; He did not need to
describe what he meant any further. To a man, they stiffened where
they lay, even Rhuarc, eyes cold enough to banish the heat from the
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To spy in that manner&rdquo;&mdash;Erim twisted his mouth
around &ldquo;spy&rdquo; as if the word tasted foul&mdash;&ldquo;would be like
spying on your own sept. No one of honor would do such a
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand refrained from asking whether they might find
someone with a slightly less prickly honor. The Aiel sense of humor
was a strange thing, often cruel, but about some matters they had
none at all.</p>

<p>To change the subject, he asked, &ldquo;Is there any word
from across the Dragonwall?&rdquo; He knew the answer; that sort of news
spread quickly even among as many Aiel as were gathered around
Rhuidean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None worth the telling,&rdquo; Rhuarc replied. &ldquo;With the
troubles among the treekillers, few peddlers come into the
Three-fold Land.&rdquo; That was the Aiel name for the Waste; a
punishment for their sin, a testing ground for their courage, an
anvil to shape them. &ldquo;Treekillers&rdquo; was what they called Cairhienin.
&ldquo;The Dragon banner still flies over the Stone of Tear. Tairens have
moved north into Cairhien as you ordered, to distribute food among
the treekillers. Nothing more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have let the treekillers starve,&rdquo; Bael
muttered, and Jheran closed his mouth with a snap. Rand suspected
he had been about to say much the same.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Treekillers are fit for nothing except to be killed
or sold as animals in Shara,&rdquo; Erim said grimly. Those were two of
the things Aiel did to those who came into the Waste uninvited;
only gleemen, peddlers, and Tinkers had safe passage, though Aiel
avoided the Tinkers as if they carried fever. Shara was the name of
the lands beyond the Waste; not even the Aiel knew much about
them.</p>

<p>From the corner of his eye, Rand saw two women
standing expectantly just inside the tall, arched doorway. Someone
had hung strings of colored beads there, red and blue, to replace
the missing doors. One of the women was Moiraine. For a moment he
considered making them wait; Moiraine had that irritatingly
commanding look on her face, clearly expecting them to break off
everything for her. Only, there was really nothing left to
discuss, and he could tell from the men&rsquo;s eyes that they did not
want to make conversation. Not so soon after speaking of the
bleakness, and the Shaido.</p>

<p>Sighing, he stood, and the clan chiefs imitated him.
All except Han were as tall as he or taller. Where Rand had grown
up, Han would have been considered of average height or better;
among Aiel, he was accounted short. &ldquo;You know what must be done.
Bring in the rest of the clans, and keep an eye on the Shaido.&rdquo; He
paused a moment, then added, &ldquo;It will end well. As well for the
Aiel as I can manage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The prophecy said you would break us,&rdquo; Han said
sourly, &ldquo;and you have made a good beginning. But we will follow
you. Till shade is gone,&rdquo; he recited, &ldquo;till water is gone, into the
Shadow with teeth bared, screaming defiance with the last breath,
to spit in Sightblinder&rsquo;s eye on the Last Day.&rdquo; Sightblinder was
one of the Aiel names for the Dark One.</p>

<p>There was nothing for Rand except to make the proper
response. Once he had not known it. &ldquo;By my honor and the Light, my
life will be a dagger for Sightblinder&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until the Last Day,&rdquo; the Aiel finished, &ldquo;to Shayol
Ghul itself.&rdquo; The harper played on pacifically.</p>

<p>The chiefs filed out past the two women, eyeing
Moiraine respectfully. There was nothing of fear in them. Rand
wished he could be as sure of himself. Moiraine had too many plans
for him, too many ways of pulling strings he did not know she had
tied to him.</p>

<p>The two women came in as soon as the chiefs were
gone, Moiraine as cool and elegant as ever. A small, pretty woman,
with or without those Aes Sedai features he could never put an age
to, she had abandoned the damp, cooling cloth for her temples. In
its place, a small blue stone hung suspended. on her forehead from
a fine golden chain in her dark hair. It would not have mattered if
she had kept it; nothing could diminish her queenly carriage. She
usually seemed to own a foot more height than she actually had, and
her eyes were all confidence and command.</p>

<p>The other woman was taller, though still short of
his shoulder, and young, not ageless. Egwene, whom he had grown up
with. Now, except for her big dark eyes, she could almost have
passed as an Aiel woman, and not only for her tanned face and
hands. She wore a full Aiel skirt of brown wool and a loose white
blouse of a plant fiber called <em>algode</em>. <em>Algode</em> was
softer than even the finest-woven wool; it would do very well for
trade, if he ever convinced the Aiel. A gray shawl hung around
Egwene&rsquo;s shoulders, and a folded gray scarf made a wide band to
hold back the dark hair that fell below her shoulders. Unlike most
Aiel women, she wore only one bracelet, ivory carved into a circle
of flames, and a single necklace of gold and ivory beads. And one
more thing. A Great Serpent ring on her left hand.</p>

<p>Egwene had been studying with some of the Aiel Wise
Ones&mdash;exactly what, Rand did not know, though he more than
suspected something to do with dreams; Egwene and the Aiel women
were closemouthed&mdash;but she had studied in the White Tower,
too. She was one of the Accepted, on the way to becoming Aes Sedai.
And passing herself off, here and in Tear at least, as full Aes
Sedai already. Sometimes he teased her about that; she did not take
his japes very well, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wagons will be ready to leave for Tar Valon
soon,&rdquo; Moiraine said. Her voice was musical, crystalline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send a strong guard,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;or Kadere may not
take them where you want.&rdquo; He turned for the windows again, wanting
to look out and think, about Kadere. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not needed me to hold
your hand or give you permission before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly something seemed to strike him across the
shoulders, for all the world like a thick hickory stick; only the
slight feel of goose bumps on his skin, not likely in this heat,
told him that one of the women had channeled.</p>

<p>Spinning back to face them, he reached out to <em>
saidin</em>, filled himself with the One Power. The Power felt like
life itself swelling inside him, as if he were ten times, a hundred
times as alive; the Dark One&rsquo;s taint filled him, too, death and
corruption, like maggots crawling in his mouth. It was a torrent
that threatened to sweep him away, a raging flood he had to fight
every moment. He was almost used to it now, and at the same time
he would never be used to it. He wanted to hold on to the sweetness
of <em>saidin</em> forever, and he wanted to vomit. And all the
while the deluge tried to scour him to the bone and burn his bones
to ash.</p>

<p>The taint would drive him mad eventually, if the
Power did not kill him first; it was a race between the two.
Madness had been the fate of every man who had channeled since the
Breaking of the World began, since that day when Lews Therin
Telamon, the Dragon, and his Hundred Companions had sealed up the
Dark One&rsquo;s prison at Shayol Ghul. The last backblast from that
sealing had tainted the male half of the True Source, and men who
could channel, madmen who could channel, had torn the world
apart.</p>

<p>He filled himself with the Power&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;And he could
not tell which woman had done it. They both looked at him as if
butter would not melt in their mouths, each with an eyebrow arched
almost identically in slightly amused questioning. Either or both
could be embracing the female half of the Source right that
instant, and he would never know.</p>

<p>Of course, a stick across the shoulders was not
Moiraine&rsquo;s way; she found other means of chastising, more subtle,
usually more painful in the end. Yet even sure that it must have
been Egwene, he did nothing. <em>Proof</em>. Thought slid along the
outside of the Void; he floated within, in emptiness, thought and
emotion, even his anger, distant. <em>I will do nothing without
proof. I will not be goaded, this time</em>. She was not the Egwene
he had grown up with; she had become part of the Tower since
Moiraine sent her there. Moiraine again. Always Moiraine. Sometimes
he wished he were rid of Moiraine. <em>Only sometimes?</em></p>

<p>He concentrated on her. &ldquo;What do you want of me?&rdquo; His
voice sounded flat and cold to his own ears. The Power stormed
inside him. Egwene had told him that for a woman, touching <em>
saidar</em>, the female half of the Source, was an embrace; for a
man, always, it was a war without mercy. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t mention wagons
again, little sister. I usually find out what you mean to do long
after it is done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai frowned at him, and no wonder. She was
surely not used to being addressed so, not by any man, even the
Dragon Reborn. He had no idea himself where &ldquo;little sister&rdquo; had
come from; sometimes of late words seemed to pop into his head. A
touch of madness, perhaps. Some nights he lay awake till the small
hours, worrying about that. Inside the Void, it seemed someone
else&rsquo;s worry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should speak alone.&rdquo; She gave the harper a cool
glance.</p>

<p>Jasin Natael, as he called himself here, lay
half-sprawled on cushions against one of the windowless walls,
softly playing the harp perched on his knee, its upper arm carved
and gilded to resemble the creatures on Rand&rsquo;s forearms. Dragons,
the Aiel called them. Rand had only suspicions where Natael had
gotten the thing. He was a dark-haired man, who would have been
accounted taller than most elsewhere than the Aiel Waste, in his
middle years. His coat and breeches were dark blue silk suitable
for a royal court, elaborately embroidered with thread-of-gold on
collar and cuffs, everything buttoned up or laced despite the heat.
The fine clothes were at odds with his gleeman&rsquo;s cloak spread out
beside him. A perfectly sound cloak, but covered completely with
hundreds of patches in nearly as many colors, all sewn so as to
flutter at the slightest breeze, it signified a country
entertainer, a juggler and tumbler, musician and storyteller who
wandered from village to village. Certainly not a man to wear silk.
The man had his conceits. He appeared completely immersed in his
music.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can say what you wish in front of Natael,&rdquo; Rand
said. &ldquo;He is gleeman to the Dragon Reborn, after all.&rdquo; If keeping
the matter secret was important enough, she would press it, and he
would send Natael away, though he did not like the man to be out of
his sight.</p>

<p>Egwene sniffed loudly and shifted her shawl on her
shoulders. &ldquo;Your head is swelled up like an overripe melon, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo; She said it flatly, as a statement of fact.</p>

<p>Anger bubbled outside the Void. Not at what she had
said; she had been in the habit of trying to take him down a rung
even when they were children, usually whether he deserved it or
not. But of late it seemed to him she had taken to working with
Moiraine, trying to put him off balance so the Aes Sedai could push
him where she wanted. When they were younger, before they learned
what he was, he and Egwene had thought they would marry one day.
And now she sided with Moiraine against him.</p>

<p>Face hard, he spoke more roughly than he intended.
&ldquo;Tell me what you want, Moiraine. Tell me here and now, or let it
wait until I can find time for you. I&rsquo;m very busy.&rdquo; That was an
outright lie. Most of his time was spent practicing the sword with
Lan, or the spears with Rhuarc, or learning to fight with hands and
feet from both. But if there was any bullying to be done here
today, he would do it. Natael could hear anything. Almost anything.
So long as Rand knew where he was at all times.</p>

<p>Moiraine and Egwene both frowned, but the real Aes
Sedai at least seemed to see he would not be budged this time. She
glanced at Natael, her mouth tightening&mdash;the man still seemed
deep in his music&mdash;then took a thick wad of gray silk from
her pouch.</p>

<p>Unfolding it, she laid what it had contained on the
table, a disc the size of a man&rsquo;s hand; half dead black, half
purest white, the two colors meeting in a sinuous line to form two
joined teardrops. That had been the symbol of Aes Sedai, before the
Breaking, but this disc was more. Only seven like it had ever been
made, the seals on the Dark One&rsquo;s prison. Or rather, each was a
focus for one of those seals. Drawing her belt knife, its hilt
wrapped in silver wire, Moiraine scraped delicately at the edge of
the disc. And a tiny flake of solid black fell away.</p>

<p>Even encased in the Void, Rand gasped. The emptiness
itself quivered, and for an instant the Power threatened to
overwhelm him. &ldquo;Is this a copy? A fake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found this in the square below,&rdquo; Moiraine said.
&ldquo;It is real, though. The one I brought with me from Tear is the
same.&rdquo; She could have been saying she wanted pea soup for the
midday meal. Egwene, on the other hand, clutched her shawl around
her as if cold.</p>

<p>Rand felt the stirrings of fright himself, oozing
across the surface of the Void. It was an effort to let go of <em>
saidin</em>, but he forced himself. If he lost concentration, the
Power could destroy him where he stood, and he wanted all his
attention on the matter at hand. Even so, even with the taint, it
was a loss.</p>

<p>That flake lying on the table was impossible. Those
discs were made of <em>cuendillar</em>, heartstone, and nothing
made of <em>cuendillar</em> could be broken, not even by the One
Power. Whatever force was used against it only made it stronger.
The making of heartstone had been lost in the Breaking of the
World, but whatever had been made of it during the Age of Legends
still existed, even the most fragile vase, even if the Breaking had
sunk it to the bottom of the ocean or buried it beneath a mountain.
Of course, three of the seven discs were broken already, but it had
taken a good deal more than a knife.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, though, he did not know how
those three really had been broken. If no force short of the
Creator could break heartstone, then that should be that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; he asked, surprised that his voice was still
as steady as when the Void had surrounded him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; Moiraine replied, just as calm
outwardly. &ldquo;But you do see the problem? A fall from the table could
break this. If the others, wherever they may be, are like this,
four men with hammers could break open that hole in the Dark One&rsquo;s
prison again. Who can even say how effective one is, in this
condition?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand saw. <em>I&rsquo;m not ready yet</em>. He was not sure
he ever would be ready, but he surely was not yet. Egwene looked as
though she were staring into her own open grave.</p>

<p>Rewrapping the disc, Moiraine replaced it in her
pouch. &ldquo;Perhaps I will think of a possibility before I carry this
to Tar Valon. If we know why, perhaps something can be done about
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was caught by the image of the Dark One reaching
out from Shayol Ghul once more, eventually breaking free
completely; fires and darkness covered the world in his mind,
flames that consumed and gave no light, blackness solid as stone
squeezing the air. With that filling his head, what Moiraine had
just said took a moment to penetrate. &ldquo;You intend to go yourself?&rdquo;
He had thought she meant to stick to him like moss to a rock. <em>
Isn&rsquo;t this what you want?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Eventually,&rdquo; Moiraine replied quietly. &ldquo;Eventually I
will have to leave you, after all. What will be, must be.&rdquo; Rand
thought she shivered, but it was so quick it could have been his
imagination, and the next instant she was all composure and
self-control once more. &ldquo;You must be ready.&rdquo; The reminder of his
doubts came unpleasantly. &ldquo;We should discuss your plans. You cannot
sit here much longer. Even if the Forsaken are not planning to come
after you, they are out there, spreading their power. Gathering the
Aiel will do no good if you find that everything beyond the Spine
of the World is in their hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chuckling, Rand leaned back against the table. So
this was just another ploy; if he was anxious about her leaving,
perhaps he would be more willing to listen, more amenable to being
guided. She could not lie, of course, not right out. One of the
vaunted Three Oaths took care of that: to speak no word that was
not true. He had learned that it left a barn-width of wriggle room.
She would leave him alone eventually. After he was dead, no
doubt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to discuss my plans,&rdquo; he said dryly.
Pulling a short-stemmed pipe and a leather tabac pouch from his
coat pocket, he thumbed the bowl full and briefly touched <em>
saidin</em> to channel a flame dancing above the tabac. &ldquo;Why? They
are my plans.&rdquo; Puffing slowly, he waited, ignoring Egwene&rsquo;s
glower.</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s face never changed, but her large,
dark eyes seemed to blaze. &ldquo;What have you done when you refused to
be guided by me?&rdquo; Her voice was as cool as her features, yet the
words still seemed to come like whip-cracks. &ldquo;Wherever you have
gone, you have left death, destruction and war behind you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in Tear,&rdquo; he said, too quickly. And too
defensively. He must not let her put him off balance. Determinedly,
he took spaced, deliberate puffs at his pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she agreed, &ldquo;not in Tear. For once you had a
nation behind you, a people, and what did you do with it? Bringing
justice to Tear was commendable. Establishing order in Cairhien,
feeding the hungry, is laudable. Another time I would praise you
for it.&rdquo; She herself was Cairhienin. &ldquo;But it does not help you
toward the day you face Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don.&rdquo; A single-minded woman, and
cold when it came to anything else, even her own land. But should
he not be just as single-minded?</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you have me do? Hunt down the Forsaken
one by one?&rdquo; Again he forced himself to draw more slowly on the
pipe; it was an effort. &ldquo;Do you even know where they are? Oh,
Sammael is in Illian&mdash;you know that&mdash;but the rest? What
if I go after Sammael as you wish, and find two or three or four of
them? Or all nine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could have faced three or four, perhaps all nine
surviving,&rdquo; she said icily, &ldquo;had you not left <em>Callandor</em> in
Tear. The truth is, you are running. You do not really have a plan,
not a plan to ready you for the Last Battle. You run from place to
place, hoping that in some way everything will come out for the
best. Hoping, because you do not know what else to do. If you would
take my advice, at least you&mdash;&rdquo; He cut her off, gesturing
sharply with his pipe, with never a care for the glares the two
women gave him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do have a plan.&rdquo; If they wanted to know, let them
know, and he would be burned if he changed a word. &ldquo;First, I mean
to put an end to the wars and killing, whether I started them or
not. If men have to kill, let them kill Trollocs, not each other.
In the Aiel War, four clans crossed the Dragonwall, and had their
way for better than two years. They looted and burned Cairhien,
defeated every army sent against them. They could have taken Tar
Valon, had they wanted. The Tower couldn&rsquo;t have stopped them,
because of your Three Oaths.&rdquo; Not to use the Power as a weapon
except against Shadowspawn or Darkfriends, or in defense of their
own lives, that was another of the Oaths, and the Aiel had not
threatened the Tower itself. Anger had him in its grip now. Running
and hoping, was he? &ldquo;Four clans did that. What will happen when I
lead eleven across the Spine of the World?&rdquo; It would have to be
eleven; small hope of bringing in the Shaido. &ldquo;By the time the
nations even think of uniting, it will be too late. They&rsquo;ll accept
my peace, or I&rsquo;ll be buried in the Can Breat.&rdquo; A discordant plunk
rose from the harp, and Natael bent over the instrument, shaking
his head. In a moment the soothing sounds came again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A melon couldn&rsquo;t be swollen enough for your head,&rdquo;
Egwene muttered, folding her arms beneath her breasts. &ldquo;And a stone
couldn&rsquo;t be as stubborn! Moiraine is only trying to help you. Why
won&rsquo;t you see that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai smoothed her silk skirts, though they
did not need it. &ldquo;Taking the Aiel across the Dragonwall might be
the worst thing you could possibly do.&rdquo; There was an edge to her
voice, anger or frustration. At least he was getting across to her
that he was no puppet. &ldquo;By this time, the Amyrlin Seat will be
approaching the rulers of every nation that still has a ruler,
laying the proofs before them that you are the Dragon Reborn. They
know the Prophecies; they know what you were born to do. Once they
are convinced of who and what you are, they will accept you because
they must. The Last Battle is coming, and you are their only hope,
humankind&rsquo;s only hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand laughed out loud. It was a bitter laugh.
Sticking his pipe between his teeth, he hoisted himself to sit
cross-legged atop the table, staring at them. &ldquo;So you and Siuan
Sanche still think you know everything there is to know.&rdquo; The Light
willing, they did not know near everything about him, and would
never find out. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re both fools.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show some respect!&rdquo; Egwene growled, but Rand went on
over her words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Tairen High Lords know the Prophecies, too, and
they knew me, once they saw the Sword That Cannot Be Touched
clutched in my fist. Half of them expect me to bring them power or
glory or both. The other half would as soon slip a knife in my back
and try to forget the Dragon Reborn was ever in Tear. That is how
the nations will greet the Dragon Reborn. Unless I quell them
first, the same way I did the Tairens. Do you know why I left <em>
Callandor</em> in Tear? To remind them of me. Every day they know
it is there, driven into the Heart of the Stone, and they know I&rsquo;ll
come back for it. That is what holds them to me.&rdquo; That was one
reason he had left the Sword That Is Not a Sword behind. He did not
like even to think of the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be very careful,&rdquo; Moiraine said after a moment. Just
that, in a voice all frozen calm. He heard stark warning in the
words. Once he had heard her say in much the same tone that she
would see him dead before letting the Shadow have him. A hard
woman.</p>

<p>For a long moment she gazed at him, her eyes dark
pools that threatened to swallow him. Then she made a perfect
curtsy. &ldquo;By your leave, my Lord Dragon, I will see to letting
Master Kadere know where I expect him to work tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one could have seen or heard the faintest mockery
in action or words, but Rand felt it. Anything that might put him
off balance, make him more biddable by guilt or shame or
uncertainty or whatever, she would try. He stared after her until
the clicking beads in the doorway obscured her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no need you scowling like that, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo; Egwene&rsquo;s voice was low, her eyes irate; she held on to
her shawl as if she wanted to strangle him with it. &ldquo;Lord Dragon,
indeed! Whatever you are, you&rsquo;re a rude, ill-mannered lout. You
deserve more than you got. It would not kill you to be civil!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it <em>was</em> you,&rdquo; he snapped, but to his
surprise she half-shook her head before catching herself. It had
been Moiraine after all. If the Aes Sedai was showing that much
temper, something must be wearing at her terribly. Him, no doubt.
Perhaps he should apologize. <em>I suppose it</em> wouldn&rsquo;t <em>
hurt to be civil</em>. Though he could not see why he was supposed
to be mannerly to the Aes Sedai while she tried to lead him on a
leash.</p>

<p>But if he was thinking of trying to be polite, Egwene
was not. If glowing coals were dark brown, they would have been
exactly like her eyes. &ldquo;You are a wool-headed fool, Rand al&rsquo;Thor,
and I should never have told Elayne you were good enough for her.
You aren&rsquo;t good enough for a weasel! Bring your nose down. I
remember you sweating, trying to talk your way out of some trouble
Mat had gotten you into. I can remember Nynaeve switching you till
you howled, and you needing a cushion to sit on the rest of the
day. Not that many years gone, either. I ought to tell Elayne to
forget you. If she knew half what you&rsquo;ve turned into&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gaped at her as the tirade went on, with her more
furious than at any time since first coming through the bead
curtain. Then it hit him. That little near shake of her head that
she had not meant to give, letting him know it had been Moiraine
who struck him with the Power. Egwene worked very hard at doing
what she was about in proper fashion. Studying with the Wise Ones,
she wore Aiel clothes; she might even be trying to adopt Aiel
customs, for all he knew. It would be like her. But she worked hard
at being a proper Aes Sedai all the time, even if she was only one
of the Accepted. Aes Sedai usually kept a rein on their tempers,
but they never ever gave anything away that they wanted to
hide.</p>

<p><em>Ilyena never flashed her temper at me when she
was angry with herself. When she gave me the rough side of her
tongue, it was because she</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;His mind froze for an
instant. He had never met a woman named Ilyena in his life. But he
could summon up a face for the name, dimly; a pretty face, skin
like cream, golden hair exactly the shade of Elayne&rsquo;s. This had to
be the madness. Remembering an imaginary woman. Perhaps one day he
would find himself having conversations with people who were not
there.</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s harangue shut off with a concerned look.
&ldquo;Are you all right, Rand?&rdquo; The anger was gone from her voice as if
it had never been. &ldquo;Is something wrong? Should I fetch Moiraine
back to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he said, and just as quickly softened his own
tone. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t Heal&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Even an Aes Sedai could not Heal
madness; none of them could Heal any of what ailed him. &ldquo;Is Elayne
well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is well.&rdquo; Despite what Egwene had said, there
was a hint of sympathy in her voice. That was all he really
expected. Beyond what he had known when Elayne left Tear, what she
was up to was an Aes Sedai concern and none of his; so Egwene had
told him more than once, and Moiraine echoed her. The three Wise
Ones who could dreamwalk, those Egwene was studying with, had been
even less informative; they had their own reasons not to be pleased
with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had best go, too,&rdquo; Egwene went on, settling her
shawl over her arms. &ldquo;You are tired.&rdquo; Frowning slightly, she said,
&ldquo;Rand, what does it mean to be buried in the Can
Breat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He started to ask what under the Light she was
talking about. Then he remembered using that phrase. &ldquo;Just
something I heard once,&rdquo; he lied. He had no more idea what it meant
than where it had come from.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You rest, Rand,&rdquo; she said, sounding twenty years
older rather than two younger. &ldquo;Promise me you will. You need it.&rdquo;
He nodded. She studied his face for a moment as though searching
for the truth, then started for the door.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s silver goblet of wine floated up from the
carpet and drifted to him. He hastily snatched it out of the air
just before Egwene looked back over her shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t tell you this,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Elayne didn&rsquo;t give it to me as a message for you, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She
said she loves you. Perhaps you know already, but if you don&rsquo;t, you
should think about it.&rdquo; With that she was gone, the beads clicking
together behind her.</p>

<p>Leaping from the table, Rand hurled the goblet away,
splashing wine across the floor tiles as he rounded on Jasin Natael
in a fury.</p>
