<h4><em>An Unexpected Offer</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">S</span>unlight
creeping through the window woke Nynaeve.
For a moment she lay sprawled atop the striped coverlet. Elayne lay
sleeping in the other bed. The early morning was already warm, and
the night had not been much better, but that was not the reason
Nynaeve&rsquo;s shift was twisted and sweaty. Her dreams after discussing
what she had seen with Elayne had not been good. In most she had
been back in the Tower, being dragged before the Amyrlin, who was
sometimes Elaida and sometimes Moghedien. In some Rand had been
lying beside the Amyrlin&rsquo;s writing table like a dog, collared and
leashed and muzzled. The dreams about Egwene had been as bad in a
way; boiled catfern and powdered mavinsleaf tasted just as bad in a
dream as they did awake.</p>

<p>Making her way to the washstand, she cleansed her
face, and scrubbed her teeth with salt and soda. The water was not
hot, but it could not be called cool either. The sodden shift she
stripped off, and dug a fresh one from one of the chests, along
with a hairbrush and mirror. Peering at her own image, she
regretted undoing her braid for comfort. It had not helped, and now
her hair hung in a tangle to her waist. Sitting down on the chest,
she laboriously worked the knots out, then began giving her hair
its hundred strokes.</p>

<p>Three scratches ran down her neck and disappeared
beneath her shift. They were not as red as they might have been,
thanks to an ointment of heal-all taken from the Macura woman. She
had told Elayne they came from brambles. Foolish&mdash;she
suspected that Elayne knew it was not true, despite her tale of
looking about the Tower grounds after Egwene left&mdash;but she
had been too upset to think straight. She had snapped at the other
woman several times, for no reason except that she was thinking
about her unfair treatment by Melaine and Egwene. <em>Not that it
doesn&rsquo;t do her good to be reminded she&rsquo;s not the Daughter-Heir
here</em>. Still, it was none of the girl&rsquo;s fault; she would have
to make it up to her.</p>

<p>In the mirror she saw Elayne rise and begin washing.
&ldquo;I still think my plan is best,&rdquo; the girl said, scrubbing her face.
Her raven-dyed hair did not seem to have one snarl, despite her
curls. &ldquo;We could be in Tear much more quickly my way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her plan was to abandon the coach once they reached
the Eldar, at some small village where there would not likely be
many Whitecloaks, and just as important, no eyes-and-ears for the
Tower. There they were to take a riverboat down to Ebou Dar, where
they could find a ship for Tear. That they had to go to Tear was no
longer in doubt. Tar Valon they would avoid at all cost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long before a boat stops where we are?&rdquo; Nynaeve
said patiently. She had thought this was all settled before they
went to sleep. It had been, to her mind. &ldquo;You yourself said that
every boat might not stop. And how long do we wait in Ebou Dar
before we find a ship for Tear?&rdquo; Putting the brush down, she began
remaking her braid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The villagers hang out a flag if they want a boat to
put in, and most will. And there are always ships for anywhere in a
seaport the size of Ebou Dar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As if the girl had ever been in a seaport of any size
before leaving the Tower with Nynaeve. Elayne always thought that
whatever she had not learned of the world as Daughter-Heir of
Andor, she had learned in the Tower, even after plenty of proof to
the contrary. And how dare she put on that forbearing tone with
her! &ldquo;We are not likely to find that gathering of Blues on a ship,
Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her own plan was to stick with the coach, cross the
rest of Amadicia, then Altara and Murandy, to Far Madding in the
Hills of Kintara, and over the Plains of Maredo to Tear. It would
certainly take longer, but aside from the chance of finding that
gathering somehow, coaches very rarely sank. She could swim, but
she was not comfortable with land completely out of sight.</p>

<p>Patting her face dry, Elayne changed her shift and
came to help with doing the braid. Nynaeve was not fooled; she
would hear about boats again. Her stomach did not like boats. Not
that that had influenced her decision, of course. If she could
bring Aes Sedai to Rand&rsquo;s Aiel, it would be well worth the longer
travel time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you recalled the name?&rdquo; Elayne asked, weaving
the strands of hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least I remembered there was a name. Light, give
me time.&rdquo; She was sure there had been a name. A town, it would have
to be or a city. She could not have seen the name of a country and
forgotten it. Drawing a long breath, she took a hold on her temper,
and went on in a milder tone. &ldquo;I will remember it, Elayne. Just
give me time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne made a noncommittal sound and continued
braiding. After a bit, she said, &ldquo;Was it really wise to send
Birgitte looking for Moghedien?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve shot the young woman a sidelong frown, but it
rolled off her like water off oiled silk. As a change of subject,
this was not the one she would have chosen. &ldquo;Better we find her
than she finds us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. But what will we do when we find
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had no answer for that. But it was better to be
the hunter than the hunted, however roughly it went. The Black Ajah
had taught her that.</p>

<p>The common room was not crowded when they went down,
yet even at that early hour there was a sprinkling of pale cloaks
among the patrons, mostly on older men, all with officers&rsquo; rank. No
doubt they preferred to eat from the inn&rsquo;s kitchens rather than
what Whitecloak cooks dished up in the garrison. Nynaeve would
almost rather have eaten on a tray again, but that little room was
like a box. All of these men were intent on their food, the
Whitecloaks no less than the others. Surely it was quite safe.
Cooking smells filled the air; apparently these men wanted beef or
mutton even first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>No sooner did Elayne&rsquo;s foot leave the last step than
Mistress Jharen bustled up to offer them, or &ldquo;the Lady Morelin&rdquo;
rather, a private dining room. Nynaeve never shifted her eyes
toward Elayne, but the other woman said, &ldquo;I think we will eat here.
I seldom have the opportunity to eat in a common room, and I quite
enjoy it, really. Have one of your girls bring us something
cooling. If the day is like this already, I fear I&rsquo;ll swelter
before we reach the next stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a constant wonder to Nynaeve that that haughty
manner never got them thrown bodily into the street. She had met
enough lords and ladies by now to know that nearly all behaved in
that fashion, but still. She would not have put up with it for a
minute. The innkeeper, though, bobbed a curtsy, smiling and
drywashing her hands, then showed them to a table near a window
looking onto the street and scurried away to do Elayne&rsquo;s bidding.
Perhaps that was her way of getting back at the girl. They were off
by themselves, well away from the men already at other tables, but
anyone walking by could stare in at them, and if any of their food
was hot&mdash;which she hoped it was not&mdash;they were as far
from the kitchens as it was possible to be.</p>

<p>When it came, breakfast consisted of spicy muffins&mdash;wrapped in a white cloth and still warm, and pleasant even
so&mdash;yellow pears, blue grapes that looked a bit wizened, and
some sort of red things that the serving girl called strawberries,
though they looked like no berry that Nynaeve had ever seen. They
certainly did not taste anything like straw, especially with
clotted cream spooned on top. Elayne claimed to have heard of them,
but then she would. With a lightly spiced wine supposedly cooled in
the springhouse&mdash;one sip told her that the spring was not
very cool, if there was one&mdash;it made a refreshing morning
meal.</p>

<p>The nearest man was three tables away, and he wore a
dark blue woolen coat, a prosperous tradesman perhaps, but they did
not talk. Plenty of time for that when they were on the road again,
and could be sure that there was no danger of sharp ears. Nynaeve
finished her food well before Elayne. The way the girl took her
time quartering a pear, you would think they had all day to sit at
table.</p>

<p>Suddenly Elayne&rsquo;s eyes went wide with shock, and the
short knife clattered to the table. Nynaeve&rsquo;s head whipped around
to find a man taking the bench on the other side of the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it was you, Elayne, but the hair put me
off at first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve stared at Galad, Elayne&rsquo;s half-brother.
Stared was the word, of course. Tall and steely slender, dark of
hair and eye, he was the most handsome man she had ever seen.
Handsome was not enough; he was gorgeous. She had seen women
cluster around him in the Tower, even Aes Sedai, all of them
smiling like fools. She wiped the smile from her own face. But she
could do nothing about her racing heart, nor make herself breathe
properly. She did not feel anything for him; it was just that he
was beautiful. <em>Take hold of yourself woman!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; She was pleased that she
did not sound strangled. It was not fair for a man to look like
that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what are you doing wearing <em>that</em>?&rdquo;
Elayne&rsquo;s voice was low, but it still held a snap.</p>

<p>Nynaeve blinked, and realized he wore a shirt of
shining mail and a white cloak with two golden knots of rank
beneath a flaring sun. She felt color rising in her cheeks. Staring
at a man&rsquo;s face so hard that she had not even seen what he was
wearing! She wanted to hide her own face from humiliation.</p>

<p>He smiled, and Nynaeve had to take a deep breath. &ldquo;I
am here because I was one of the Children recalled from the north.
And I am a Child of the Light because it seemed the right thing to
do. Elayne, when you two and Egwene vanished, it did not take long
for Gawyn and me to find out that you were not doing penance on a
farm, whatever we were told. They had no right to involve you in
their plots, Elayne. Any of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to have attained rank very quickly,&rdquo;
Nynaeve said. Did the fool man not realize that talking of Aes
Sedai plots here was a good way to get them both killed?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eamon Valda seemed to think my experience warranted
it, wherever gained.&rdquo; His shrug dismissed rank as unimportant. It
was not modesty, precisely, but not pretense either. The finest
swordsman among those who came to study with the Warders in the
Tower, he had also stood high in the classes on strategy and
tactics, but Nynaeve could not remember him boasting about his
prowess, even in jest. Accomplishments meant nothing to him,
perhaps because they came so easily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does Mother know of this?&rdquo; Elayne demanded, still in
that quiet voice. Her scowl would have frightened a wild boar,
though.</p>

<p>Galad shifted just a hair, uneasily. &ldquo;There has been
no good time to write her. But do not be so sure she will
disapprove, Elayne. She is not so friendly with the north as she
was. I hear a ban may be made law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sent her a letter, explaining.&rdquo; Elayne&rsquo;s glare had
transformed to puzzlement. &ldquo;She must understand. She trained in the
Tower, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep your voice down,&rdquo; he said, low and hard.
&ldquo;Remember where you are.&rdquo; Elayne flushed a deep red, but whether in
anger or embarrassment, Nynaeve could not say.</p>

<p>Abruptly she realized that he had been speaking as
quietly as they, and carefully, too. He had not mentioned the Tower
once, or Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Egwene with you?&rdquo; he went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, and he sighed deeply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had hoped&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Gawyn was nearly unhinged with
worry when she disappeared. He cares for her, too. Will you tell me
where she is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve took note of that &ldquo;too.&rdquo; The man had become a
Whitecloak, yet he &ldquo;cared for&rdquo; a woman who wanted to be Aes Sedai.
Men were so strange they were hardly human sometimes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will not,&rdquo; Elayne said firmly, the crimson
receding from her cheeks. &ldquo;Is Gawyn here, too? I will not believe
he has become a&mdash;&rdquo; She had the wit to lower her voice further,
but she still said, &ldquo;A Whitecloak!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He remains in the north, Elayne.&rdquo; Nynaeve supposed
that he meant Tar Valon, but surely Gawyn had gone from there.
Surely he could not support Elaida. &ldquo;You cannot know what has
happened there, Elayne,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;All the corruption and
vileness in that place bubbled to the top, as it had to. The woman
who sent you away has been deposed.&rdquo; He looked around and dropped
his voice to a momentary whisper, despite no one being close enough
to overhear. &ldquo;Stilled and executed.&rdquo; Taking a deep breath, he made
a disgusted sound. &ldquo;It was never a place for you. Or for Egwene. I
have not been long with the Children, but I am certain my captain
will give me leave to escort my sister home. That is where you
should be, with Mother. Tell me where Egwene is, and I will see
that she is brought to Caemlyn, too. You will both be safe
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s face felt numb. Stilled. And executed. Not
an accidental death, or illness. That she had considered the
possibility did not make the fact less shocking. Rand had to be the
reason. If there had ever been any small hope that the Tower might
not oppose him, it was gone. Elayne showed no expression at all,
her eyes staring at the distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see my news shocks you,&rdquo; he said in a low voice.
&ldquo;I do not know how deeply that woman meshed you in her plot, but
you are free of her now. Let me see you safely to Caemlyn. No one
need know you had any more contact with her than the other girls
who went there to learn. Either of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve showed him her teeth, in what she hoped
looked like a smile. It was nice to be included, finally. She could
have smacked him. If only he were not so good-looking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will think on it,&rdquo; Elayne said slowly. &ldquo;What you
say makes sense, but you must give me time to think. I must
think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve stared at her. It made sense? The girl was
blathering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can give you a little time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I do
not have much if I am to ask leave. We may be ordered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a square-faced, black-haired
Whitecloak clapping Galad on the shoulder and grinning widely.
Older, he wore the same two knots of rank on his cloak. &ldquo;Well,
young Galad, you can&rsquo;t keep all the pretty women for yourself.
Every girl in town sighs when you walk by, and most of their
mothers as well. Introduce me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Galad scraped back his bench to stand. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;thought I knew them when they came downstairs, Trom. But whatever
charm you think I possess, it does not work on this lady. She does
not like me, and I think she will not like any friend of mine. If
you practice the sword with me this afternoon, perhaps you can
attract one or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never with you around,&rdquo; Trom grumped good-naturedly.
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d sooner let the farrier pound my head with his hammer than
practice against you.&rdquo; But he let Galad start him for the door with
only a regretful look at the two women. As they left, Galad shot a
glance back at the table, full of frustration and indecision.</p>

<p>No sooner were they out of sight than Elayne stood.
&ldquo;Nana, I need you upstairs.&rdquo; Mistress Jharen materialized at her
side, inquiring if she had enjoyed her repast, and Elayne said, &ldquo;I
require my driver and footman immediately. Nana will settle the
bill.&rdquo; She was moving for the stairs before she finished
speaking.</p>

<p>Nynaeve stared after her, then dug out her purse and
paid the woman, making assurances that everything had been to her
mistress&rsquo; liking and trying not to wince at the price. Once rid of
the woman, she hurried upstairs. Elayne was stuffing their things
into the chests any which way, including the sweaty shifts they had
hung on the ends of the beds to dry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must leave immediately, Nynaeve. At once.&rdquo; She
did not look up until the last article was crammed in. &ldquo;Right this
minute, wherever he is, Galad is puzzling over something he may
never have faced before. Two things that are right, but opposite.
To his mind it is right to tie me to a packhorse if necessary and
haul me to Mother, to salve her worries and save me from becoming
Aes Sedai, whatever I want. And it is also right to turn us in, to
the Whitecloaks or the army or both. That is the law in Amadicia,
and Whitecloak law, too. Aes Sedai are outlawed here, and so is any
woman who has ever trained in the Tower. Mother met Ailron once to
sign a trade treaty, and they had to do it in Altara because Mother
could not legally enter Amadicia. I embraced <em>saidar</em> the
moment I saw him, and I won&rsquo;t let it go until we are far from
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you exaggerate, Elayne. He is your
brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is <em>not</em> my brother!&rdquo; Elayne drew a deep
breath and let it out slowly. &ldquo;We had the same father,&rdquo; she said in
a calmer voice, &ldquo;but he is not my brother. I will not have him.
Nynaeve, I&rsquo;ve told you time and again, but you will not take it in.
Galad does what is right. Always. He never lies. Did you hear what
he said to that Trom fellow? He didn&rsquo;t say he did not know who we
are. Every word he said was the truth. He does what is <em>
right</em>, no matter who is hurt by it, even himself. Or me. He
used to tell on Gawyn and me for everything, and on himself, too.
If he decides the wrong way, we will have Whitecloaks lying in
ambush for us before we reach the edge of the village.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A tap sounded at the door, and Nynaeve&rsquo;s breath
caught in her throat. Surely Galad would not really&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Elayne&rsquo;s
face was set, ready to fight.</p>

<p>Hesitantly, Nynaeve cracked the door. It was Thom,
and Juilin with that fool hat in his hand. &ldquo;My Lady wants us?&rdquo; Thom
asked, with a touch of servility for anyone who might overhear.</p>

<p>Able to breathe again, not caring who was listening,
she snatched the door the rest of the way open. &ldquo;Get in here, you
two!&rdquo; She was growing tired of them looking at one another every
time she spoke.</p>

<p>Before she had the door shut again, Elayne said,
&ldquo;Thom, we must leave right away.&rdquo; The determined look had left her
face, and anxiety filled her voice. &ldquo;Galad is here. You must
remember what a monster he was as a child. Well, he is no better
grown, and he is a Whitecloak besides. He could&mdash;&rdquo; The words
seemed to catch in her throat. She stared at Thom, mouth working
soundlessly, but no more wide-eyed than he stared at her.</p>

<p>He sat down heavily on one of the chests, never
taking his eyes from Elayne&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; Clearing his throat
roughly, he went on. &ldquo;I thought I saw him, watching the inn. A
Whitecloak. But he looked the man the boy would grow into. I
suppose it shouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise he grew into a Whitecloak at
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve went to the window; Elayne and Thom hardly
seemed to notice her passage between them. Traffic was beginning to
pick up in the street, farmers and farm carts and villagers
mingling with Whitecloaks and soldiers. Across the way, one
Whitecloak was sitting on an upended barrel, that perfect face
unmistakable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he&mdash;?&rdquo; Elayne swallowed. &ldquo;Did he recognize
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Fifteen years changes a man more than it does a
boy. Elayne, I thought you had forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remembered in Tanchico, Thom.&rdquo; With a wavering
smile, Elayne reached out and tugged one of his long mustaches.
Thom smiled back almost as unsteadily; he looked as if he was
contemplating a leap from the window.</p>

<p>Juilin was scratching his head, and Nynaeve wished
she had some idea what they were talking about, too, but there were
more important matters at hand. &ldquo;We still have to leave before he
brings the entire garrison down on us. With him watching, it won&rsquo;t
be easy. I haven&rsquo;t seen another patron who looks like they have a
coach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ours is the only one in the stableyard,&rdquo; Juilin
said. Thom and Elayne were still staring at one another, plainly
not hearing a word.</p>

<p>Driving off with the curtains down was no protection,
then. Nynaeve was willing to bet that Galad had already learned
exactly how they had come to Sienda. &ldquo;Is there a back way from the
stableyard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A gate wide enough for one of us at a time,&rdquo; Juilin
said dryly. &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s on the other side is little more than an
alley, anyway. There aren&rsquo;t more than two or three streets in this
village wide enough for the coach.&rdquo; He studied that cylindrical
hat, turning it in his hands. &ldquo;I could get close enough to crack his
head. If you were ready, you could drive off during the confusion.
I could catch you up on the road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve sniffed loudly. &ldquo;How? Gallop after on
Skulker? Even if you didn&rsquo;t fall out of the saddle inside a mile,
do you think you would even reach a horse if you attacked a
Whitecloak in that street?&rdquo; Galad was still there across the
street, and Trom had joined him, the pair apparently chatting idly.
She leaned over and yanked Thom&rsquo;s nearest mustache. &ldquo;Do you have
anything to add? Any brilliant plans? Did all your listening to
gossip yield anything that might help?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He clapped a hand to his face and gave her an
offended look. &ldquo;Not unless you think there&rsquo;s help in Ailron laying
claim to some border villages in Altara. A strip the whole length
of the border, from Salidar to So Eban to Mosra. Is there any help
in that, Nynaeve? Is there? Try to pull a man&rsquo;s mustache out of his
face. Somebody ought to box your ears, for once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would Ailron want with a strip along the
border, Thom?&rdquo; Elayne asked. Perhaps she was interested&mdash;she
seemed interested in every fool twist and turn of politics and
diplomacy&mdash;or perhaps she was just trying to stop an
argument. She used to try smoothing over things all the time,
before she became wrapped up in flirting with Thom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the King, child.&rdquo; His voice softened, for
her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Pedron Niall. Ailron does what he is told usually,
though he and Niall make out that it isn&rsquo;t so. Most of those
villages have been empty since the Whitecloak War, what the
Children call the Troubles. Niall was the general in the field
then, and I doubt he&rsquo;s ever given up wanting Altara. If he controls
both banks of the Eldar, he can squeeze the river trade to Ebou
Dar, and if he can crack Ebou Dar, the rest of Altara will trickle
into his hands like grain flowing from a hole in a sack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all very well,&rdquo; Nynaeve said firmly before
he or the girl could speak again. There had been something in what
he had said that tickled her memory, but she could not say what or
why. In any case, they had no time for lectures on relations
between Amadicia and Altara, not with Galad and Trom watching the
front of the inn. She said as much, adding, &ldquo;What about you,
Juilin? You consort with low types.&rdquo; The thief-catcher always
sought out the cutpurses and burglars and footpads in a town; he
claimed they knew more of what was really going on than any
official. &ldquo;Are there smugglers we can bribe to sneak us out, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You know the sort of thing we need, man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard little. Thieves keep low in Amadicia,
Nynaeve. First offense is branding, second is loss of your right
hand, and third is hanging, whether it&rsquo;s the King&rsquo;s crown or a loaf
of bread. There aren&rsquo;t many thieves in a town this size, not who do
it for a living&rdquo;&mdash;he was contemptuous of amateur thieves&mdash;&ldquo;and for the most part they only wanted to talk about two
things. Whether the Prophet is really coming to Amadicia, the way
rumor says he is, and whether the town fathers might relent and let
that traveling menagerie put on a show. Sienda is too far from the
borders for smugglers to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She cut him off with peremptory satisfaction. &ldquo;That
is it! The menagerie.&rdquo; They all looked at her as if she had gone
mad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Thom said, much too mildly. &ldquo;We can get
Luca to bring the boar-horses back, and make off while they destroy
some more of the town. I don&rsquo;t know what you gave him, Nynaeve, but
he threw a rock at us as we were driving off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For once Nynaeve forgave him his sarcasm, feeble as
it was. And his lack of wit to see what she saw. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may be,
Thom Merrilin, but Master Luca wants a patron, and Elayne and I are
going to be his patrons. We still have to abandon the coach and
team&mdash;&rdquo; That smarted; she could have built a snug house in the
Two Rivers for what they had cost. &ldquo;&mdash;and sneak out that back
way.&rdquo; Tossing open the chest with the leaf-shaped hinges, she
rooted through clothes and blankets and pots and everything that
she had not wanted to leave behind with the wagon full of dyes&mdash;she had made sure that the men packed everything except the
harness&mdash;until she came to the gilded caskets and the purses.
&ldquo;Thom, you and Juilin go out by that back gate, and find a wagon
and team of some sort. Buy some supplies and meet us on the road
back to Luca&rsquo;s camp.&rdquo; Regretfully, she filled Thom&rsquo;s hand with
gold, not even bothering to count; there was no telling what things
would cost, and she did not want him wasting time bargaining.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a wonderful idea,&rdquo; Elayne said, grinning.
&ldquo;Galad will be looking for two women, not a troupe of animals and
jugglers. And he will never think we would head for Ghealdan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve had not thought of that. She had intended
making Luca head straight for Tear. A menagerie such as he had put
together, with tumblers and jugglers in addition to animals, could
earn its way almost anywhere, she was sure. But if Galad did come
looking for them, or send someone, it would be to the east. And he
might be smart enough to look even in a menagerie; men did show
brains sometimes, usually when you least expected it. &ldquo;That was the
first thing I thought of, Elayne.&rdquo; She ignored the sudden faint
taste in her mouth, the acrid memory of boiled catfern and powdered
mavinsleaf.</p>

<p>Thom and Juilin protested, of course. Not the idea as
such, but they seemed to think that one of them remaining behind
could protect her and Elayne against Galad and any number of
Whitecloaks. They did not seem to realize that if it came to that,
channeling would do more than the pair of them and ten more
besides. They still seemed troubled, but she managed to push them
both out with the stern injunction &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you dare come back
here. We will meet you on the road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it comes to channeling,&rdquo; Elayne quietly said once
the door was shut, &ldquo;we will quickly find ourselves facing the whole
Whitecloak garrison, and probably the army garrison as well. The
Power doesn&rsquo;t make us invincible. All it will take is two
arrows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will worry about that when it comes,&rdquo; Nynaeve
told her. She hoped the men had not thought of that. If they had,
likely one of them would lurk about, and probably rouse Galad&rsquo;s
suspicions if he was not careful. She was ready to accept their
help when it was needed&mdash;Ronde Macura had taught her that,
though having to be rescued like a kitten down a well still galled&mdash;but it would be when she thought it necessary, not they.</p>

<p>A quick trip downstairs found Mistress Jharen. Her
lady had changed her mind; she did not think she could face the
heat and dust of travel again so quickly; she intended to nap, and
did not want to be disturbed until a late supper that she would
send down for. Here was the coin for another night&rsquo;s lodging. The
innkeeper was very understanding of a noble lady&rsquo;s delicacy, and
how inconstant their desires. Nynaeve thought Mistress Jharen would
be understanding of anything short of murder, so long as the
reckoning was paid.</p>

<p>Leaving the plump woman, Nynaeve cornered one of the
serving girls for a moment. A few silver pennies changed hands, and
the girl darted off in her apron to find two of the deep bonnets
that Nynaeve said looked so shady and cool; not the sort of thing
her lady would wear, of course, but they would do nicely for
her.</p>

<p>When she got back to the room, Elayne had the gilded
caskets on a blanket with the dark polished box holding the
recovered <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> and the washleather purse that held
the seal. The fat purses of coin lay beside Nynaeve&rsquo;s scrip on the
other bed. Folding the blanket, Elayne tied the bundle with some
stout cord from one of their chests. Nynaeve had saved <em>everything</em>.</p>

<p>She regretted leaving it all behind now. It was not
just the expense. Not only that; you never knew when something was
going to come in handy. Take the two woolen dresses that Elayne had
laid out on her bed. They were not fine enough for a lady, and too
fine for a lady&rsquo;s maid, but if they had left them in Mardecin as
Elayne had wanted, they would be in a fine fix for clothing
now.</p>

<p>Kneeling, Nynaeve rummaged in another chest. A few
shifts, two more wool dresses for changes. The pair of cast-iron
frying pans in a canvas bag were perfectly good, but too heavy, and
the men would certainly not forget replacements for those. The
sewing kit, in its neat bone-inlaid box; they would never think to
buy so much as a pin. Her mind was only partly on her selections,
though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You knew Thom before?&rdquo; she asked in what she hoped
was a casual tone. She watched Elayne from the corner of her eye
while pretending to concentrate on rolling stockings.</p>

<p>The girl had begun pulling out clothes of her own,
sighing over the silks before putting them aside. She froze with
her hands deep in one of the chests, and she did not look at
Nynaeve. &ldquo;He was Court-bard in Caemlyn when I was little,&rdquo; she said
quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; She did not see at all. How did a man go
from a court-bard, entertaining royalty, the next thing to a noble,
to a gleeman wandering from village to village?</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was Mother&rsquo;s lover after Father died.&rdquo; Elayne had
gone back to choosing, and she said it so matter-of-factly that
Nynaeve gaped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mother&rsquo;s&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other woman still was not looking at her, though.
&ldquo;I did not remember him until Tanchico. I was very small. It was
his mustaches, and standing close enough to look up at his face,
and hearing him recite part of <em>The Great Hunt of the Horn</em>.
He thought I&rsquo;d forgotten again.&rdquo; Her face colored slightly. &ldquo;I&mdash;drank too much wine, and the next day I made out that I
could not remember anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve could only shake her head. She remembered the
night the girl had filled her fool self with wine. At least she had
never done that again; her head the next morning had seemed an
effective cure. Now she knew why the girl behaved as she did with
Thom. She had seen the same back in the Two Rivers a few times. A
girl just old enough to really think of herself as a woman. Who
else would she measure herself against except her mother? And
sometimes, who better to compete against, to prove that she was a
woman? Usually it led to no more than trying to be better at
everything from cooking to sewing, or maybe some harmless flirting
with her father, but in the case of one widow, Nynaeve had seen the
woman&rsquo;s nearly grown daughter make a complete fool of herself
trying to capture the man her mother intended to marry. The trouble
was, Nynaeve had no idea what to do about this silliness in Elayne.
Despite severe lectures and more from her and the Women&rsquo;s Circle,
Sari Ayellin had not settled down until her mother was married
again and she herself had found a husband too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose he must have been like a second father to
you,&rdquo; Nynaeve said carefully. She pretended to concentrate on her
own packing. Thom had certainly been looking at the girl that way.
It explained so much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hardly think of him so.&rdquo; Elayne appeared intent on
deciding how many silk shifts to take, but her eyes saddened. &ldquo;I
cannot really remember my father; I was only a baby when he died.
Gawyn says he spent all of his time with Galad. Lini tried to make
the best of it, but I know he never came to see Gawyn or me in the
nursery. He would have, I know, once we were old enough to teach
things, like Galad. But he died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve tried again. &ldquo;At least Thom is fit for a man
of his age. We&rsquo;d be in a fine fix if he suffered from stiff joints.
Old men often do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He could still do backflips if not for his limp. And
I don&rsquo;t care if he does limp. He is intelligent and knowledgeable
about the world. He is gentle, and yet I feel quite safe with him.
I don&rsquo;t think I should tell him that. He tries to protect me enough
as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a sigh, Nynaeve gave up. For now, at least. Thom
might look on Elayne as a daughter, but if the girl kept this up he
just might remember that she was not, and then Elayne would find
herself in the pickling kettle. &ldquo;Thom is very fond of you, Elayne.&rdquo;
Time to shift to some other subject. &ldquo;Are you sure about Galad?
Elayne? Are you sure Galad could turn us in, Elayne?&rdquo; The other
woman gave a start, wiping a small frown from her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Galad? I&rsquo;m <em>certain</em>, Nynaeve. And if
we refuse to let him take us to Caemlyn, that will only make the
decision for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Muttering to herself, Nynaeve pulled a silk riding
dress out of her chest. Sometimes she thought the Creator had only
made men to cause trouble for women.</p>
