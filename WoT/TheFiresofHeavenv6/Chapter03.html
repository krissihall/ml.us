<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">S</span>eizing
<em>saidin</em>, Rand channeled, wove flows
of Air that snatched Natael up from the cushions; the gilded harp
tumbled to the dark red tiles as the man was pinned against the
wall, immobile from neck to ankles and his feet half a pace above
the floor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve warned you! <em>Never</em> channel when anyone
else is around. Never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Natael tilted his head in that peculiar way he had,
as if trying to look at Rand sideways, or watch without being
noticed. &ldquo;If she had seen, she would have thought it was you.&rdquo;
There was no apology in his voice, no diffidence, but no challenge
either; he seemed to think he was offering a reasonable
explanation. &ldquo;Besides, you looked thirsty. A court-bard should look
after his lord&rsquo;s needs.&rdquo; That was one of the small conceits he
surrounded himself with; if Rand was the Lord Dragon, then he
himself must be a court-bard, not a simple gleeman.</p>

<p>Feeling disgusted with himself as much as angry at
the man, Rand unraveled the weave and let him drop. Manhandling him
was like picking a fight with a boy of ten. He could not see the
shield that constricted the other man&rsquo;s access to <em>saidin</em>&mdash;it was female work&mdash;but he knew it was there. Moving a
goblet was about the extent of Natael&rsquo;s ability, now. Luckily the
shield had been hidden from female eyes, too. Natael called the
trick &ldquo;inverting&rdquo;; he did not seem able to explain it, though. &ldquo;And
if she&rsquo;d seen my face and was suspicious? I was as startled as if
that goblet had flown at me by itself!&rdquo; He stuck his pipe back
between his teeth and sent up furious streams of smoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She still wouldn&rsquo;t suspect.&rdquo; Settling back onto the
cushions, the other man took up the harp again, strumming a line of
music that had a devious sound. &ldquo;How could anyone suspect? I do not
entirely believe the situation myself.&rdquo; If there was even a touch
of bitterness in his voice, Rand could not detect it.</p>

<p>He was not entirely sure he believed it either,
though he had worked hard enough for it. The man in front of him,
Jasin Natael, had another name. Asmodean.</p>

<p>Idly playing the harp, Asmodean did not look like one
of the dreaded Forsaken. He was even moderately handsome; Rand
supposed he would be attractive to women. It often seemed strange
that evil had left no outward mark. He was one of the Forsaken, and
far from trying to kill him, Rand hid what he was from Moiraine and
everyone else. He needed a teacher.</p>

<p>If what was true for the women Aes Sedai called
&ldquo;wilders&rdquo; also held for men, he had only one chance in four of
surviving the attempt to learn to use the Power on his own. That
was discounting the madness. His teacher had to be a man; Moiraine
and others had told him often enough that a bird could not teach a
fish to fly, nor a fish a bird to swim. And his teacher had to be
someone experienced, someone who already knew all the things he
needed to learn. With Aes Sedai gentling men who could channel as
soon as they were found&mdash;and fewer were found every year&mdash;that left small choices. A man who had simply discovered he
could channel would know no more than he did. A false Dragon who
could channel&mdash;if Rand could find one not already caught and
gentled&mdash;would not be likely to give up his own dreams of
glory for another claiming to be the Dragon Reborn. What remained,
what Rand had lured to him, was one of the Forsaken.</p>

<p>Asmodean plucked random chords as Rand took a seat on
a cushion facing him. It was well to remember that the man had not
changed, not inside, from the day so long ago when he had pledged
his soul to the Shadow. What he did now, he did under duress; he
had not come to the Light. &ldquo;Do you ever think of turning back,
Natael?&rdquo; He was always careful of the name; one breath of
&ldquo;Asmodean,&rdquo; and Moiraine would be sure he had gone over to the
Shadow. Moiraine and maybe others. Neither he nor Asmodean might
survive that.</p>

<p>The man&rsquo;s hands froze on the strings, his face
utterly blank. &ldquo;Turn back? Demandred, Rahvin, any of them would
kill me on sight, now. If I was lucky. Except Lanfear perhaps, and
you will understand if don&rsquo;t want to put her to the test. Semirhage
could make a boulder beg for mercy and thank her for death. And as
for the Great Lord&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Dark One,&rdquo; Rand broke in sharply around his
pipestem. The Great Lord of the Dark was what Darkfriends called
the Dark One. Darkfriends and the Forsaken.</p>

<p>Asmodean bowed his head briefly in acquiescence.
&ldquo;When the Dark One breaks free&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; If his face had been
expressionless before, now it was bleak in every line. &ldquo;Suffice it
to say that I will find Semirhage and give myself to her before
I&rsquo;ll face the&mdash;the Dark One&rsquo;s punishment for betrayal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As well you are here to teach me, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mournful music began to flow from the harp, speaking
of loss and tears. &ldquo;The March of Death,&rdquo; Asmodean said over the
music, &ldquo;the final movement of <em>The Grand Passions Cycle</em>,
composed some three hundred years before the War of Power by&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand cut him off. &ldquo;You are not teaching me very
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As well as may be expected, under the circumstances.
You can grasp <em>saidin</em> every time you try, now, and tell one
flow from another. You can shield yourself, and the Power does what
you want it to.&rdquo; He stopped playing and frowned, not looking at
Rand. &ldquo;Do you think Lanfear really intended me to teach you
everything? If she had wanted that, she would have contrived to
stay close so she could link us. She wants you to live, Lews
Therin, but this time she means to be stronger than you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me that!&rdquo; Rand snapped, but Asmodean did
not seem to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you planned this between you&mdash;trapping me&mdash;&rdquo; Rand sensed a surge in Asmodean, as if the Forsaken were
testing the shield Lanfear had woven around him; women who could
channel saw a glow surrounding another woman who had embraced <em>
saidar</em> and felt her channeling clearly, but he never saw
anything around Asmodean and felt little. &ldquo;If you worked it out
together, then you let her outfox you on more levels than one. I&rsquo;ve
told you I am not a very good teacher, especially without a link.
You did plan it between you, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He did look at Rand then,
sidelong but still intent. &ldquo;How much do you remember? Of being Lews
Therin, I mean. She said you recalled nothing at all, but she could
lie to the Gr&mdash;the Dark One himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This time she spoke the truth.&rdquo; Seating himself on
one of the cushions, Rand channeled one of the clan chiefs&rsquo;
untouched silver goblets to him. Even such a brief touch of <em>
saidin</em> was exhilarating&mdash;and fouling. And hard to
release. He did not want to talk about Lews Therin; he was tired of
people thinking he was Lews Therin. The bowl of his pipe had grown
hot with all the puffing, so he held it by the stem and gestured
with it. &ldquo;If linking will help you teach me, why don&rsquo;t we
link?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Asmodean looked at him as if he had asked why they
did not eat rocks, then shook his head. &ldquo;I continually forget how
much you don&rsquo;t know. You and I cannot. Not without a woman to join
us. You could ask Moiraine, I suppose, or the girl Egwene. One of
them might be able to reason out the method. So long as you don&rsquo;t
mind them finding out who I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie to me, Natael,&rdquo; Rand growled. Well before
meeting Natael he had learned that a man&rsquo;s channeling and a woman&rsquo;s
were as different as men and women themselves, but he took little
the man said on trust. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard Egwene and others talk about Aes
Sedai linking their powers. If they can do it, why not you and
I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Exasperation filled Asmodean&rsquo;s
tone. &ldquo;Ask a philosopher if you want to know why. Why can&rsquo;t dogs
fly? Perhaps in the grand scheme of the Pattern, it&rsquo;s a balance for
men being stronger. We cannot link without them, but they can
without us. Up to thirteen of them can, anyway, a small mercy;
after that, they need men to make the circle larger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand was sure he had caught a lie, this time.
Moiraine said that in the Age of Legends men and women had been
equally strong in the Power, and she could not lie. He said as
much, adding, &ldquo;The Five Powers are equal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Earth, Fire, Air, Water, and Spirit.&rdquo; Natael
strummed a chord for each. &ldquo;They are equal, true, and it is also
true that what a man can do with one, a woman can also. In kind, at
least. But that has nothing to do with men being stronger. What
Moiraine believes to be truth, she tells as truth whether or not it
is; one of a thousand weaknesses in those fool Oaths.&rdquo; He played a
bit of something that did indeed sound foolish. &ldquo;Some women have
stronger arms than some men, but in general it is the other way
around. The same holds with strength in the Power, and in about the
same proportion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded slowly. It did make a kind of sense.
Elayne and Egwene were considered two of the strongest women to
train in the Tower for a thousand years or more, but he had tested
himself against them once, and later Elayne had confessed that she
felt like a kitten seized by a mastiff.</p>

<p>Asmodean was not finished. &ldquo;If two women link, they
do not double their strength&mdash;linking is not as simple as
adding together the power of each&mdash;but if they are strong
enough, they can match a man. And when they take the circle to
thirteen, then you must be wary. Thirteen women who can barely
channel could overpower most men, linked. The thirteen weakest
women in the Tower could overpower you or any man, and barely
breathe hard. I came across a saying in Arad Doman. &lsquo;The more women
there are about, the softer a wise man steps.&rsquo; It would not be bad
to remember it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shivered, thinking of a time when he had been
among many more than thirteen Aes Sedai. Of course, most of them
had not known who he was. If they had&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>If Egwene and
Moiraine linked</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He did not want to believe Egwene had
gone that far toward the Tower and away from their friendship. <em>
Whatever she does, she does with her whole heart, and she&rsquo;s
becoming Aes Sedai. So is Elayne</em>.</p>

<p>Swallowing half his wine did not completely wash the
thought away. &ldquo;What more can you tell me about the Forsaken?&rdquo; It
was a question he was sure he had asked a hundred times, but he
always hoped there was a scrap more to dig out. Better than
thinking about Moiraine and Egwene linking to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have told everything I know.&rdquo; Asmodean sighed
heavily. &ldquo;We were hardly close friends at the best. Do you believe
I am holding back something? I don&rsquo;t know where the others are, if
that is what you want. Except Sammael, and you knew he&rsquo;d taken
Illian for his kingdom before I told you. Graendal was in Arad
Doman for a time, but I expect she has gone now; she likes her
comforts too well. I suspect Moghedien is or was in the west
somewhere as well, but no one ever finds the Spider unless she
wants to be found. Rahvin has a queen for one of his pets, but your
guess is as good as mine as to what country she rules for him. And
that is all I know that might help locate them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand had heard all that before; it seemed he had
heard all Asmodean had to say of the Forsaken fifty times already.
So often that at moments it seemed he had always known what the man
was telling him. Some of it he almost wished he had never learned&mdash;what Semirhage found amusing, for instance&mdash;and some
made no sense. Demandred had gone over to the Shadow because he
envied Lews Therin Telamon? Rand could not imagine envying someone
enough to do anything because of it, and surely not that. Asmodean
claimed it had been the thought of immortality, of endless Ages of
music, that seduced him; he claimed to have been a noted composer
of music, before. Senseless. Yet in that mass of often
blood-chilling knowledge might lie keys to surviving Tarmon
Gai&rsquo;don. Whatever he told Moiraine, he knew he would have to
face them then, if not before. Emptying the goblet, he set it on
the floor tiles. Wine would not wash out facts.</p>

<p>The bead curtain rattled, and he looked over his
shoulder as <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> entered, white-robed and silent.
While some began gathering up the food and drink that had been laid
out for him and the chiefs, another, a man, carried a large silver
tray to the table. On it were covered dishes, a silver cup, and two
large, green-striped pottery pitchers. One would hold wine, the
other water. A <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> woman brought in a gilded lamp,
already lit, and set it beside the tray. Through the windows, the
sky was beginning to take on the yellow-red of sunset; in the brief
time between baking and freezing, the air actually felt
comfortable.</p>

<p>Rand stood as the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> departed, but
did not follow immediately. &ldquo;What do you think of my chances when
the Last Battle comes, Natael?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Asmodean hesitated in pulling red-and-blue striped
wool blankets from behind his cushions and looked up at him, head
tilted in that sideways manner of his. &ldquo;You found&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;in the square the day we met here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forget that,&rdquo; Rand said harshly. There had been two,
not one. &ldquo;I destroyed it, in any case.&rdquo; He thought Asmodean&rsquo;s
shoulders slumped a trifle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the&mdash;Dark One&mdash;will consume you
alive. As for me, I intend to open my veins the hour I know he is
free. If I get the chance. A quick death is better than what I&rsquo;ll
find elsewhere.&rdquo; He tossed the blankets aside and sat staring
glumly at nothing. &ldquo;Better than going mad, certainly. I&rsquo;m as
subject to that as you, now. You broke the bonds that protected
me.&rdquo; There was no bitterness in his voice; only hopelessness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if there was another way to shield against the
taint?&rdquo; Rand demanded. &ldquo;What if it could be removed somehow? Would
you still kill yourself then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Asmodean&rsquo;s barked laugh was utterly acid. &ldquo;The Shadow
take me, you must be beginning to think you really are the bloody
Creator! We are dead. Both of us. Dead! Are you too blind with
pride to see it? Or just too thick-witted, you hopeless
shepherd?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand refused to be drawn. &ldquo;Then why not go ahead and
end it?&rdquo; he asked in a tight voice. <em>I wasn&rsquo;t too blind to see
what you and Lanfear were up to. I wasn&rsquo;t too thick-witted to fool
her and trap you</em>. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s no hope, no chance, not the
smallest shred&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;then why are you still alive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still not looking at him, Asmodean rubbed the side of
his nose. &ldquo;I once saw a man hanging from a cliff,&rdquo; he said slowly.
&ldquo;The brink was crumbling under his fingers, and the only thing near
enough to grasp was a tuft of grass, a few long blades with roots
barely clinging to the rock. The only chance he had of climbing
back up on the cliff. So he grabbed it.&rdquo; His abrupt chuckle held no
mirth. &ldquo;He had to know it would pull free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you save him?&rdquo; Rand asked, but Asmodean did not
answer.</p>

<p>As Rand started for the doorway, the sounds of
&ldquo;The March of Death&rdquo; began again behind him.</p>

<p>The strings of beads fell together behind him, and
the five Maidens who had been waiting in the wide, empty hall
flowed easily to their feet from where they had been squatting on
the pale blue tiles. They were all but one tall for women, though
not for Aiel women. Their leader, Adelin, lacked little more than a
hand of being able to look him in the eyes. The exception, a fiery
redhead named Enaila, was no taller than Egwene, and extremely
touchy about being so short. Like the clan chiefs&rsquo;, their eyes were
all blue or gray or green, and their hair, light brown or yellow or
red, was cut short except for a tail at the nape of the neck. Full
quivers balanced the long-bladed knives at their belts, and they
wore cased horn bows on their backs. Each carried three or four
short, long-bladed spears and a round, bull-hide buckler. Aiel
women who did not want hearth and children had their own warrior
society, <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>, the Maidens of the Spear.</p>

<p>He acknowledged them with a small bow, which made
them smile; it was not an Aiel custom, at least not the way he had
been taught to do it. &ldquo;I see you, Adelin,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where is
Joinde? I thought she was with you earlier. Has she taken ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you, Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; she replied. Her pale
yellow hair seemed paler framing her sun-dark face, which had a
fine white scar across one cheek. &ldquo;In a way she has. She had been
talking to herself all day, and not an hour ago, she went off to
lay a bridal wreath at the feet of Garan, of the Jhirad Goshien.&rdquo;
Some of the others shook their heads; marrying meant giving up the
spear. &ldquo;Tomorrow is his last day as her <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>. Joinde
is Black Rock Shaarad,&rdquo; she added significantly. It was
significant; marriages came frequently with men or women taken <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em>, but very seldom between clans with blood feud, even
blood feud in abeyance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an illness that spreads,&rdquo; Enaila said
heatedly. Her voice was usually as hot as her hair. &ldquo;One or two
Maidens make their bridal wreaths every day since we came to
Rhuidean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded with what he hoped they took for
sympathy. It was his fault. If he told them, he wondered how many
would still risk staying near him. All, probably; honor would hold
them, and they had no more fear than the clan chiefs. At least it
was only marriages, so far; even Maidens would think marrying
better than what some had experienced. Maybe they would. &ldquo;I will be
ready to go in a moment,&rdquo; he told them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will wait with patience,&rdquo; Adelin said. It hardly
seemed patience; standing there, they all appeared poised on the
edge of sudden movement.</p>

<p>It really did take him only a moment to do what he
wanted, weave flows of Spirit and Fire into a box around the room
and tie them so the weave held on its own. Anyone could go in or
out&mdash;except a man who could channel. For himself or Asmodean
walking through that doorway would be like walking through a wall
of solid flame. He had discovered the weave&mdash;and that
Asmodean, blocked, was too weak to channel through it&mdash;by
accident. No one was likely to question the doings of a gleeman,
but if someone did, Jasin Natael had simply chosen to sleep as far
from Aiel as he could manage in Rhuidean. That was a choice that
Hadnan Kadere&rsquo;s drivers and guards, at least, could sympathize
with. And this way Rand knew exactly where the man was of a night.
The Maidens asked him no questions.</p>

<p>He turned away. The Maidens followed him, spread out
and wary as if they expected an attack right there. Asmodean was
still playing the lament.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Arms outstretched to either side, Mat Cauthon walked
the wide white coping of the dry fountain, singing to the men who
watched him in the fading light.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll drink the wine till the cup is dry,<br>
 and kiss the girls so they&rsquo;ll not cry,<br>
 and toss the dice until we fly<br>
 to dance with Jak o&rsquo; the Shadows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The air felt cool after the day&rsquo;s heat, and he
thought briefly of buttoning up his fine green silk coat with the
golden embroidery, but the drink the Aiel called <em>oosquai</em>
had put a buzz in his head like giant flies, and the thought
flittered away. The white stone figures of three women stood on a
platform in the dusty basin, twenty feet tall and unclothed. Each
had been made with one hand upraised, the other holding a huge
stone jar tilted over her shoulder for water to pour from, but one
was missing her head and upraised hand, and on another the jar was
a shattered ruin.</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll dance all night while the moon runs free,<br>
 and dandle the lasses upon our knee,<br>
 and then you&rsquo;ll ride along with me,<br>
 to dance with Jak o&rsquo; the Shadows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fine song to be singing about death,&rdquo; one of the
wagon drivers shouted in a heavy Lugarder accent. Kadere&rsquo;s men kept
themselves in a tight knot apart from the Aielmen around the
fountain; they were all tough, hard-faced men, but every one was
sure any Aiel would slit his throat for a wrong glance. They were
not far wrong. &ldquo;I heard my old grandmother talk about Jak o&rsquo; the
Shadows,&rdquo; the big-eared Lugarder went on. &ldquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t right to sing
about death that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat muzzily considered the song he had been singing
and grimaced. No one had heard &ldquo;Dance with Jak o&rsquo; the Shadows&rdquo;
since Aldeshar fell; in his head, he could still hear the defiant
song rising as the Golden Lions launched their last, futile charge
at Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s encircling army. At least he had not been
babbling it in the Old Tongue. He was not as juicy as he looked by
half, but there had indeed been too many cups of <em>oosquai</em>. The stuff
looked and tasted like brown water, but it hit your head like a
mule&rsquo;s kick. <em>Moiraine will pack me off to the Tower yet, if I&rsquo;m
not careful. At least it would get me out of the Waste and away
from Rand</em>. Maybe he was drunker than he thought, if he
considered that a fair trade. He shifted to &ldquo;Tinker in the
Kitchen.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="verse_quote">&ldquo;Tinker in the kitchen; with a job of work to do.<br>
 Mistress up above, slipping on a robe of blue.<br>
 She dances down the staircase, her fancy all so free,<br>
 crying, Tinker, oh, dear Tinker, won&rsquo;t you mend a pot for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of Kadere&rsquo;s men joined in the song as he danced
back to where he had begun. The Aiel did not; among them, men did
not sing except for battle chants or laments for the slain, and
neither did Maidens, except among themselves.</p>

<p>Two Aielmen were squatting on the coping, showing
none of the effects of the <em>oosquai</em> they had consumed,
unless their eyes were the faintest bit glassy. He would be glad to
get back where light-colored eyes were a rarity; growing up, he had
not seen anything but brown or black except on Rand.</p>

<p>A few pieces of wood&mdash;wormholed arms and legs
from chairs&mdash;lay on the broad paving stones, in the area left
open by the watchers. An empty red pottery crock lay beside the
coping, as did another that still held <em>oosquai</em>, and a silver cup.
The game was to take a drink, then try to hit a target thrown into
the air with a knife. None of Kadere&rsquo;s men and few of the Aiel
would dice with him, not when he won as often as he did, and they
did not play at cards. Knife throwing was supposed to be different,
especially with <em>oosquai</em> added in. He had not won as often
as he did with dice, but half a dozen worked gold cups and two
bowls lay inside the basin beneath him, along with bracelets and
necklaces set with rubies or moonstones or sapphires, and a
scattering of coins as well. His flat-crowned hat and an odd spear
with a black haft rested beside his winnings. Some of it was even
Aiel made. They were more likely to pay for something with a piece
of loot than with a coin.</p>

<p>Corman, one of the Aiel on the coping, looked up at
him as he cut off singing. A white scar slanted across his nose.
&ldquo;You are nearly as good with knives as you are with dice, Matrim
Cauthon. Shall we call it an end? The light is failing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of light.&rdquo; Mat squinted at the sky;
pale shadows covered everything here in the valley of Rhuidean, but
the sky was still light enough to see against, at least. &ldquo;My
grandmother could make the throw in this. I could make it
blindfolded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jenric, the other squatting Aiel, peered around the
onlookers. &ldquo;Are there women here?&rdquo; Built like a bear, he considered
himself a wit. &ldquo;The only time a man talks like that is when there
are women to impress.&rdquo; The Maidens scattered through the crowd
laughed as hard as anyone else, and maybe harder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think I can&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Mat muttered, ripping off the
dark scarf he wore around his neck to hide the scar where he had
once been hung. &ldquo;Just you shout &lsquo;now&rsquo; when you throw it up,
Corman.&rdquo; Hastily he tied the scarf around his eyes and drew one of
his knives from his sleeve. The loudest sound was the watchers
breathing. <em>Not drunk? I&rsquo;m juicier than a fiddler&rsquo;s whelp</em>.
And yet, he suddenly felt his luck, felt that surge the way he did
when he knew which spots would show before the dice stopped
tumbling. It seemed to clear his head a little. &ldquo;Throw it,&rdquo; he
murmured calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Corman called, and Mat&rsquo;s arm whipped back,
then forward.</p>

<p>In the stillness, the <em>thunk</em> of steel
stabbing wood was as loud as the clatter of the target on the
pavement.</p>

<p>No one said a word as he pulled the scarf back down
around his neck. A piece of a chair arm no bigger than his hand lay
in the open space, his blade stuck firmly in the middle. Corman had
tried to shave the odds, it appeared. Well, he had never specified
the target. He suddenly realized he had not even made a wager.</p>

<p>Finally one of Kadere&rsquo;s men half-shouted, &ldquo;The Dark
One&rsquo;s own luck, that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luck is a horse to ride like any other,&rdquo; Mat said to
himself. No matter where it came from. Not that he knew where his
luck came from; he only tried to ride it as best he could.</p>

<p>As quietly as he had spoken, Jenric frowned up at
him. &ldquo;What was that you said, Matrim Cauthon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat opened his mouth to repeat himself, then closed
it again as the words came clear in his mind. <em>Sene sovya
caba&rsquo;donde am dovienya</em>. The Old Tongue. &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he
muttered. &ldquo;Just talking to myself.&rdquo; The onlookers were beginning to
drift away. &ldquo;I guess the light really is fading too much to go
on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Corman put a foot on the piece of wood to wrench
Mat&rsquo;s knife free and brought it back to him. &ldquo;Some time again
maybe, Matrim Cauthon, some day.&rdquo; That was the Aiel way of saying
&ldquo;never&rdquo; when they did not want to say it right out.</p>

<p>Mat nodded as he slipped the blade back into one of
the sheaths inside his sleeve; it was the same as the time he had
rolled six sixes twenty-three times in a row. He could hardly blame
them. Being lucky was not all it was made out. He noted with a bit
of envy that neither Aiel staggered in the slightest as they joined
the departing crowd.</p>

<p>Scrubbing a hand through his hair, Mat sat down
heavily on the coping. The memories that had once cluttered his
head like raisins in a cake now blended with his own. In one part
of his mind he knew he had been born in the Two Rivers twenty years
before, but he could remember clearly leading the flanking attack
that turned the Trollocs at Maighande, and dancing in the court of
Tarmandewin, and a hundred other things, a thousand. Mostly
battles. He remembered dying more times than he wanted to think of.
No seams between lives anymore; he could not tell his memories from
the others unless he concentrated.</p>

<p>Reaching behind him, he set his wide-brimmed hat on
his head and fished the odd spear across his knees. Instead of an
ordinary spearhead, it had what looked like a two-foot sword blade,
marked with a pair of ravens. Lan said that that blade had been
made with the One Power during the War of the Shadow, the War of
the Power; the Warder claimed it would never need sharpening and
never break. Mat thought he would not trust that unless he had to.
It might have lasted three thousand years, but he had little trust
of the Power. Cursive script ran along the black haft, punctuated
at either end with another raven, inlaid in some metal even darker
than the wood. In the Old Tongue, but he could read it now, of
course.</p>

<p class="verse">Thus is our treaty written; thus is agreement made.<br>
Thought is the arrow of time; memory never fades.<br>
What was asked is given. The price is paid.</p>

<p>One way down the wide street, half a mile off, was a
square that would have been called large in most cities. The Aiel
traders were gone for the night, but their pavilions still stood,
made of the same grayish brown wool used for Aiel tents. Hundreds
of traders had come to Rhuidean from every part of the Waste, for
the biggest fair the Aiel had ever seen, and more arrived every
day. The traders had been among the first to actually start living
in the city.</p>

<p>Mat did not really want to look the other way, toward
the great plaza. He could make out the shapes of Kadere&rsquo;s wagons,
awaiting more loading tomorrow. What appeared to be a twisted
redstone doorframe had been heaved into one that afternoon;
Moiraine had taken particular care to see it lashed firmly in place
just as she wanted.</p>

<p>He did not know what she knew of it&mdash;and he was
not about to ask; better if she forgot he was alive, though small
chance of that&mdash;but whatever she knew, he was sure he knew
more. He had stepped through it, a fool looking for answers. What
he had gotten instead was a head full of other men&rsquo;s memories.
That, and dead. He tucked the scarf closer around his neck. And two
other things. A silver foxhead medallion that he wore under his
shirt, and the weapon across his knees. Small recompense. He ran
his fingers lightly down the script. <em>Memory never fades</em>.
They had a sense of humor fit for Aiel, those folk on the other
side of that doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you do that every time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He jerked his head around to stare at the Maiden who
had just sat down beside him. Tall even for an Aiel, maybe taller
than he was, she had hair like spun gold and eyes the color of a
clear morning sky. She was older than he, maybe by ten years, but
that had never put him off. Then again, she was <em>Far Dareis
Mai</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Melindhra,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;of the Jumai sept.
Can you do that every time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She meant the knife throwing, he realized. She gave
her sept, but no clan. Aiel never did that. Unless&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;She had to
be one of the Shaido Maidens who had come to join Rand. He did not
really understand all this about societies, but as for Shaido, he
remembered them trying to stick spears in him too well. Couladin
did not like anyone associated with Rand, and what Couladin hated,
the Shaido hated. On the other hand, Melindhra had come here to
Rhuidean. A Maiden. But she wore a small smile; her gaze held an
inviting light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of the time,&rdquo; he said truthfully. Even when he
did not feel it, his luck was good; when he did, it was perfect.
She chuckled, her smile widening, as if she thought he was
boasting. Women seemed to make up their minds whether you were
lying without looking at the evidence. On the other hand, if they
liked you, they either did not care or else decided even the most
outrageous lie was true.</p>

<p>Maidens could be dangerous, whatever their clan&mdash;any woman could; he had learned that on his own&mdash;but
Melindhra&rsquo;s eyes were definitely not just looking at him.</p>

<p>Dipping into his winnings, he pulled up a necklace of
gold spirals, each centered on a deep blue sapphire, the largest as
big as the joint of his thumb. He could remember a time&mdash;his
own memory&mdash;when the smallest of those stones would have made
him sweat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll look pretty with your eyes,&rdquo; he said, laying
the heavy strand in her hands. He had never seen a Maiden wear
baubles of any sort, but in his experience, every woman liked
jewelry. Strangely, they liked flowers nearly as well. He did not
understand it, but then, he was willing to admit that he understood
women less than he did his luck, or what had happened on the other
side of that twisted doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very fine work,&rdquo; she said, holding it up. &ldquo;I accept
your offer.&rdquo; The necklace disappeared into her belt pouch, and she
leaned over to push his hat back on his head. &ldquo;Your eyes are
pretty. Like dark polished catseye.&rdquo; She twisted around to pull her
feet up onto the coping and sat with her arms wrapped around her
knees, studying him intently. &ldquo;My spear sisters have told me about
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat pulled his hat back into place and watched her
warily from under the brim. What had they told her? And what
&ldquo;offer&rdquo;? It was only a necklace. The invitation was gone from her
eyes; she looked like a cat studying a mouse. That was the trouble
with Maidens of the Spear. Sometimes it was hard to tell whether
they wanted to dance with you, kiss you, or kill you.</p>

<p>The street was emptying, the shadows deepening, but
he recognized Rand slanting across down the way, pipe clenched
between his teeth. He was the only man in Rhuidean likely to be
walking with a fistful of <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>. <em>They&rsquo;re
always around him</em>, Mat thought. <em>Guarding him like a pack
of she-wolves, leaping to do whatever he says</em>. Some men might
have envied him that much at least. Not Mat. Not most of the time.
If it had been a pack of girls like Isendre, now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me for a moment,&rdquo; he told Melindhra
hurriedly. Leaning his spear against the low wall around the
fountain, he leaped up already running. His head still buzzed, but
not so loudly as before, and he did not stagger. He had no worries
about his winnings. The Aiel had very definite views of what was
allowed: taking in a raid was one thing, theft another. Kadere&rsquo;s
men had learned to keep their hands in their pockets after one of
them had been caught stealing. After a beating that left him
striped from shoulders to heels, he had been sent away. The one
water bag he had been allowed would not have been nearly enough for
him to reach the Dragonwall, even if he had had any clothes on. Now
Kadere&rsquo;s men would not pick up a copper they found lying in the
street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand?&rdquo; The other man walked on with his encircling
escort. &ldquo;Rand?&rdquo; Rand was not even ten paces away, but he did not
waver. Some of the Maidens looked back, but not Rand. Mat felt cold
suddenly, and it had nothing to do with the onset of night. He wet
his lips and spoke again, not a shout. &ldquo;Lews Therin.&rdquo; And Rand
turned around. Mat almost wished he had not.</p>

<p>For a time they only looked at one another in the
twilight. Mat hesitated about going closer. He tried telling
himself it was because of the Maidens. Adelin had been one of those
who taught him a so-called game, Maidens&rsquo; Kiss, that he was never
likely to forget; or play again, if he had any say in it. And he
could feel Enaila&rsquo;s gaze like an auger boring into his skull. Who
would have expected a woman to go up like oil thrown on a fire just
because you told her she was the prettiest little flower you had
ever seen?</p>

<p>Rand, now. He and Rand had grown up together. They
and Perrin, the blacksmith&rsquo;s apprentice back in Emond&rsquo;s Field, had
hunted together, fished together, tramped through the Sand Hills to
the edge of the Mountains of Mist, camped under the stars. Rand was
his friend. Only now he was the kind of friend who might bash your
head in without meaning to. Perrin could be dead, because of
Rand.</p>

<p>He made himself walk to arm&rsquo;s reach of the other man.
Rand was nearly a head taller, and in the early-evening gloom he
seemed taller yet. Colder than he had been. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking,
Rand.&rdquo; Mat wished he did not sound hoarse. He hoped Rand would
answer to his right name this time. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been away from home a
long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We both have,&rdquo; Rand said softly. &ldquo;A long time.&rdquo;
Suddenly he gave a laugh, not loud, but almost like the old Rand.
&ldquo;Are you beginning to miss milking your father&rsquo;s cows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat scratched his ear, grinning a bit. &ldquo;Not that,
exactly.&rdquo; If he never saw the inside of another barn it would be
too soon. &ldquo;But I was thinking that when Kadere&rsquo;s wagons go, I might
go with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand was silent. When he spoke again, the brief flash
of mirth was gone. &ldquo;All the way to Tar Valon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Mat&rsquo;s turn to hesitate. <em>He wouldn&rsquo;t give
me away to Moiraine. Would he?</em> &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; he said casually. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s where Moiraine will want me. Maybe I&rsquo;ll find a
chance to get back to the Two Rivers. See if everything&rsquo;s all right
at home.&rdquo; <em>See if Perrin&rsquo;s alive. See if my sisters are, and
Mother and Da</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all have to do what we must, Mat. Not what we
want to, very often. What we must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It sounded like an excuse, to Mat, as if Rand was
asking him to understand. Only, he had done what he had to himself
a few times. <em>I can&rsquo;t blame Perrin on him, not by himself.
Nobody bloody forced me to follow after Rand like some bloody
heel-hound!</em> Only that was not true, either. He had been
forced. Just not by Rand. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t&mdash;stop me leaving?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t try to tell you to come or go, Mat,&rdquo; Rand
said wearily. &ldquo;The Wheel weaves the Pattern, not me, and the Wheel
weaves as the Wheel wills.&rdquo; For all the world like a bloody Aes
Sedai! Half turning; to go, Rand added, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trust Kadere, Mat.
In some ways he&rsquo;s about as dangerous a man as you ever met. Don&rsquo;t
trust him an inch, or you might get your throat slit, and you and I
wouldn&rsquo;t be the only ones to regret that.&rdquo; Then he was gone, down
the street in the deepening dusk, with the Maidens around him like
slinking wolves.</p>

<p>Mat stared after him. Trust the merchant? <em>I
wouldn&rsquo;t trust Kadere if he was tied in a sack</em>. So Rand did
not weave the Pattern? He came close! Before ever any of them
learned that the Prophecies had anything to do with them, they had
learned that Rand was <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, one of those rare
individuals who, instead of being woven willy-nilly into the
Pattern, instead forced the Pattern to shape itself around them.
Mat knew about being <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>; he was one himself, though
not as strong as Rand. Sometimes Rand could affect people&rsquo;s lives,
change the course of them, just by being in the same town. Perrin
was <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> as well&mdash;or, maybe had been. Moiraine
had thought it was significant, finding three young men who grew up
in the same village, all destined to be <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>. She
meant to fit them all into her plans, whatever they were.</p>

<p>It was supposed to be a grand thing; all the <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em> Mat had been able to learn about had been men like
Artur Hawkwing, or women like Mabriam en Shereed, who stories said
had founded the Compact of the Ten Nations after the Breaking. But
none of the stories told what happened when one <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>
was close to another as strong as Rand. It was like being a leaf in
a whirlpool.</p>

<p>Melindhra stopped beside him and handed him his spear
and a heavy, coarse-woven sack that clinked. &ldquo;I put your winnings
in this for you.&rdquo; She was taller than he was, by a good two inches.
She glanced after Rand. &ldquo;I had heard you were near-brother to Rand
al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a manner of speaking,&rdquo; he said dryly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does not matter,&rdquo; she said dismissively, and
concentrated her gaze on him, fists on her hips. &ldquo;You attracted my
interest, Mat Cauthon, before you gave me a regard-gift. Not that I
will give up the spear for you, of course, but I have had my eye
on you for days. You have a smile like a boy about to do mischief.
I like that. And those eyes.&rdquo; In the failing light her grin was
slow and wide. And warm. &ldquo;I do like your eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat tugged his hat straight, though it had not been
crooked. From pursuer to pursued, in the blink of an eye. It could
happen like that, with Aiel women. Especially Maidens. &ldquo;Does
&rsquo;Daughter of the Nine Moons&rsquo; mean anything to you?&rdquo; It was a
question he asked women sometimes. The wrong answer would send him
out of Rhuidean tonight if he had to try walking out of the
Waste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But there are things I like to
do by moonlight.&rdquo; Putting an arm around his shoulder, she took off
his hat and began to whisper in his ear. In no time at all he was
grinning even more widely than she.</p>
