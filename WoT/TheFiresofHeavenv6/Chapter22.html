<h4><em>Birdcalls by Night</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">L</span>ying
facedown on his blankets with his eyes closed,
Mat luxuriated in the feel of Melindhra&rsquo;s thumbs kneading their way
down his spine. There was nothing quite as good as a massage after
a long day in the saddle. Well, some things were, but right then,
he was willing to settle for her thumbs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are well muscled for such a short man, Matrim
Cauthon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He opened one eye and glanced back at her, kneeling
astride his hips. She had built the fire up twice as high as
needed, and sweat trickled down her body. Her fine golden hair,
close-cut except for that Aiel tail at the nape of her neck, clung
to her scalp. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m too short, you can always find somebody
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not too short for my taste,&rdquo; she laughed,
ruffling his hair. It was longer than hers. &ldquo;And you are cute.
Relax. This does no good if you tense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grunting, he closed his eyes again. Cute? <em>
Light!</em> And short. Only Aiel could call him short. In every
other land he had been in, he was taller than most men, if not
always by much. He could remember being tall. Taller than Rand,
when he rode against Artur Hawkwing. And a hand shorter than he was
now when he fought beside Maecine against the Aelgari. He had
spoken to Lan, claiming he had overheard some names; the Warder
said Maecine had been a king of Eharon, one of the Ten Nations&mdash;that much Mat already knew&mdash;some four or five hundred
years before the Trolloc Wars. Lan doubted that even the Brown Ajah
knew more; much had been lost in the Trolloc Wars, and more in the
War of the Hundred Years. Those were the earliest and latest of the
memories that had been planted in his skull. Nothing after Artur
Paendrag Tanreall, and nothing before Maecine of Eharon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you cold?&rdquo; Melindhra said incredulously. &ldquo;You
shivered.&rdquo; She scrambled off him, and he heard her add wood to the
fire; there was enough scrub here for burning. She slapped his
bottom hard as she climbed back on, murmuring, &ldquo;Good muscle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you keep on like that,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think
you mean to spit me for supper, like a Trolloc.&rdquo; It was not that he
did not enjoy Melindhra&mdash;as long as she refrained from
pointing out that she was taller, anyway&mdash;but the situation
made him uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No spits for you, Matrim Cauthon.&rdquo; Her thumbs dug
hard into his shoulder. &ldquo;That is it. Relax.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He supposed that he would marry someday, settle down.
That was what you did. A woman, a house, a family. Shackled to one
spot for the rest of his life. <em>I never heard of a wife yet that
liked her husband having a drink or a gamble</em>. And there was
what those folk on the other side of the doorframe <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> had said. That he was fated &ldquo;to marry the Daughter
of the Nine Moons.&rdquo; <em>A man has to marry sooner or later, I
suppose</em>. But he certainly did not mean to take an Aiel wife.
He wanted to dance with as many women as he could, while he
could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not made for spits, but for great honor, I
think,&rdquo; Melindhra said softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sounds fine to me.&rdquo; Only now he could not get
another woman to look at him, not the Maidens or the others. It was
as if Melindhra had hung a sign on him saying <span class="smallcaps">owned by Melindhra of
the Jumai Shaido</span>. Well, she would not have put that last bit on,
not here. Then again, who knew what an Aiel would do, especially a
Maiden of the Spear? Women did not think the same as men, and Aiel
women did not think like anybody else in the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is strange that you efface yourself so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Efface myself?&rdquo; he mumbled. Her hands did feel good;
knots were coming out that he had not known were there. &ldquo;How?&rdquo; He
wondered if it had something to do with that necklace. Melindhra
seemed to set great store by it, or by receiving it, anyway. She
never wore the thing, of course. Maidens did not. But she carried
it in her pouch, and showed it to every woman who asked. A lot of
them seemed to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You put yourself in the shadow of Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in anybody&rsquo;s shadow,&rdquo; he said absently. It
could not be the necklace. He had given jewelry to other women,
Maidens and others; he liked giving things to pretty women, even if
all he got in return was a smile. He never expected more. If a
woman did not enjoy a kiss and a cuddle as much as he did, what was
the point?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, there is honor of a sort in being in the
shadow of the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>. To be near the mighty, you must
stand in their shade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shade,&rdquo; Mat agreed, not really hearing. Sometimes
the women accepted and sometimes not, but none had decided they
owned him. That was what rankled, really. He was not about to be
owned by any woman, however pretty she was. And no matter how good
her hands were at loosening knotted muscles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your scars should be scars of honor, earned in your
own name, as a chief, not this.&rdquo; One finger traced along the
hanging scar on his neck. &ldquo;Did you earn this serving the <em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shrugging her hand away, he pushed up on his elbows
and twisted to look at her. &ldquo;Are you sure &lsquo;Daughter of the Nine
Moons&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean anything to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have told you it does not. Lie down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are lying to me, I swear I&rsquo;ll welt your
rump.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hands on hips, she looked down at him dangerously.
&ldquo;Do you think that you can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;welt my rump, Mat Cauthon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give it my best try.&rdquo; She would probably put a
spear through his ribs. &ldquo;Do you swear you&rsquo;ve never heard of the
Daughter of the Nine Moons?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never have,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;Who is she? Or
what? Lie down, and let me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A blackbird called, seemingly everywhere in the tent
and outside as well, and a moment later, a redwing. Good Two Rivers
birds. Rand had chosen his warnings from what he knew, birds not
found in the Waste.</p>

<p>Melindhra was off him in an instant, wrapping her
<em>shoufa</em> around her head, veiling herself as she snatched up
spears and bucklers. She darted from the tent like that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood and bloody ashes!&rdquo; Mat muttered as he
struggled into his breeches. A redwing meant the south. He and
Melindhra had put up their tent to the south, with the Chareen, as
far from Rand as they could get and stay in the encampment. But he
was not going outside in those thornbushes naked, the way Melindhra
had. The blackbird meant north, where the Shaarad were camped; they
were coming from two sides at once.</p>

<p>Stamping his feet in his boots as best he could in
the low tent, he looked at the silver foxhead lying beside his
blankets. Shouts were rising outside, the clash of metal on metal.
He had finally figured out that that medallion had somehow kept
Moiraine from Healing him on her first try. So long as he had been
touching it, her channeling had not affected him. He had never
heard of Shadowspawn able to channel, but there was always the
Black Ajah&mdash;so Rand said, and he believed it&mdash;and
always the chance that one of the Forsaken had finally come after
Rand. Pulling the leather thong over his head so the medallion hung
on his chest, he snatched up his raven-marked spear and ducked out
into cold moonlight.</p>

<p>He had no time to feel the icy chill. Before he was
completely out of the tent, he almost lost his head to a
scythe-curved Trolloc sword. The blade brushed his hair as he threw
himself into a low dive, rolling to his feet with the spear
ready.</p>

<p>At first glance in the darkness, the Trolloc might
have been a bulky man, though half again as tall as any Aielman,
garbed all in black mail with spikes at elbows and shoulders, and a
helmet with goat&rsquo;s horns attached. But these horns grew out of that
too human head, and below the eyes a goat&rsquo;s muzzle thrust out.</p>

<p>Snarling, the Trolloc lunged at him, and howled in a
harsh language never meant for a human tongue. Mat spun his spear
like a quarterstaff, knocking the heavy, curved blade to one side,
and thrust his long spearpoint into the creature&rsquo;s middle, mail
parting for that Power-made steel as easily as the flesh beneath.
The goat-snouted Trolloc folded over with a harsh cry, and Mat
pulled his weapon free, dodging aside as it fell.</p>

<p>All around him Aiel, some unclothed or only half but
all black-veiled, fought Trollocs with tusked boars&rsquo; snouts or
wolves&rsquo; muzzles or eagles&rsquo; beaks, some with heads horned or crested
with feathers, wielding those oddly curved swords and spiked axes,
hooked tridents and spears. Here and there one used a huge bow to
shoot barbed arrows the size of small spears. Men fought alongside
the Trollocs, too, in rough coats, with swords, shouting
desperately as they died among the thornbushes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sammael!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sammael and the Golden Bees!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Darkfriends <em>were</em> dying, most as soon as
they engaged an Aiel, but the Trollocs died harder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am no bloody hero!&rdquo; Mat shouted to no one in
particular as he battled a Trolloc with a bear&rsquo;s muzzle and hairy
ears, his third. The creature carried a long-handled axe, with half
a dozen sharp spikes and a flaring blade big enough to split a
tree, throwing it about like a toy in those great hairy hands. It
was being near Rand that got Mat into these things. All he wanted
from life was some good wine, a game of dice, and a pretty girl or
three. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be mixed up in this!&rdquo; Especially not if
Sammael was around. &ldquo;Do you hear me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Trolloc went down with a ruined throat, and he
found himself facing a Myrddraal, just as it finished killing two
Aiel who had come at it together. The Halfman looked like a man,
pasty pale, armored in black overlapping scales like a snake&rsquo;s. It
moved like a snake, too, boneless and fluid and quick, night-black
cloak hanging still however it darted. And it had no eyes. Just a
dead-white sweep of skin where eyes should be.</p>

<p>That eyeless gaze turned on him, and he shivered,
fear oozing along his bones. &ldquo;The look of the Eyeless is fear,&rdquo;
they said in the Borderlands, where they should know, and even Aiel
admitted that a Myrddraal&rsquo;s stare sent chills through the marrow.
That was the creature&rsquo;s first weapon. The Halfman came at him in a
flowing run.</p>

<p>With a roar, Mat rushed to meet it, spear spinning
like a quarterstaff, thrusting, ever moving. The thing carried a
blade as dark as its cloak, a sword hammered at the forges of
Thakan&rsquo;dar, and if that cut him, he was as good as dead unless
Moiraine appeared quickly with her Healing. But there was only one
sure way to take down a Fade. All-out attack; you had to overwhelm
it before it overwhelmed you, and a thought for defense could be a
good way to die. He could not even spare a glance for the battle
raging around him in the night.</p>

<p>The Myrddraal&rsquo;s blade flickered like a serpent&rsquo;s
tongue, darted like black lightning, but to counter Mat&rsquo;s attack.
When raven-marked Power-wrought steel met Thakan&rsquo;dar-made metal,
blue light flashed around them, a crackle of sheet lightning.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mat&rsquo;s slashing attack struck flesh. Black
sword and pale hand flew away, and the reverse stroke sliced open
the Myrddraal&rsquo;s throat, but Mat did not stop. Thrust through the
heart, cut to one hamstring, then the other, all in rapid
succession. Only then did he step away from the thing still
thrashing on the ground, flailing about with its good hand and
severed stump, wounds spilling inky blood. Halfmen took a long time
to admit that they were dead; they did not die completely except
with a setting sun.</p>

<p>Looking around, Mat realized that the attack was
over. Whatever Darkfriends or Trollocs were not dead, had fled; at
least, he saw none standing except Aiel. Some of them were down,
too. He plucked a kerchief from the neck of a Darkfriend corpse to
wipe the Myrddraal&rsquo;s black blood from his spearpoint. It would etch
the metal if left too long.</p>

<p>This night assault made no sense. By the bodies he
could see in the moonlight, Trolloc and human, none had made it
much past the first line of tents. And without far greater numbers,
they could not have hoped for more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that you called out? <em>Carai</em>
something. The Old Tongue?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned to look at Melindhra. She had unveiled, but
she still wore not a stitch more than her <em>shoufa</em>. There
were other Maidens about, and men, wearing as little, and showing
as little concern, though most did seem to be heading back to their
tents without lingering. They had no modesty, that was it. No
modesty at all. She did not even seem to feel the cold, though her
breath made wisps of mist. He was as sweaty as she, and freezing
now that he had no fight for his life to occupy his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something I heard once,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;I liked the
sound of it.&rdquo; <em>Carai an Caldazar!</em> For the honor of the Red
Eagle. The battle cry of Manetheren. Most of his memories were from
Manetheren. Some of those he had had before the twisted doorway.
Moiraine said it was the Old Blood coming out. Just as long as it
did not come out of his veins.</p>

<p>She put an arm around his shoulders as he started
back toward their tent. &ldquo;I saw you with the Nightrunner, Mat
Cauthon.&rdquo; That was one of the Aiel names for Myrddraal. &ldquo;You are as
tall as a man needs to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grinning, he slipped his arm around her waist, but he
could not get the attack out of his head. He wanted to&mdash;his
thoughts were too snarled in his borrowed memories&mdash;but he
could not. Why had anyone launched such a hopeless assault? No one
but a fool attacked overwhelming force without a reason. That was
the thought he could not pry out of his head. No one attacked
without a reason.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The birdcalls pulled Rand awake immediately, and he
seized <em>saidin</em> as he tossed the blankets aside and ran out,
coatless, in his stocking feet. The night was cold and moonlit,
faint sounds of battle drifting up from the hills below the pass.
Around him, Aiel stirred like scurrying ants, rushing into the
night to where an attack might come here in the pass. The wards
would signal again&mdash;Shadowspawn in the pass would cause a
winterfinch to call&mdash;until he unraveled them in the morning,
but there was no point in taking foolish chances.</p>

<p>Soon the pass was still again, the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>
in their tents, forbidden weapons even now, the other Aiel off at
the places that might need defending. Even Adelin and the other
Maidens had gone, as if they knew he would have held them back if
they waited. He could hear a few mutters from the wagons near the
town walls, but neither the drivers nor Kadere showed themselves;
he did not expect them to. The faint sounds of battle&mdash;men
shouting, screaming, dying&mdash;came from two directions. Both
below, well away from him. People were out around the Wise Ones&rsquo;
tents, too; staring toward the fighting, it seemed.</p>

<p>An attack down there made no sense. It was not the
Miagoma, not unless Timolan had taken Shadowspawn into his clan,
and that was as likely as Whitecloaks recruiting Trollocs. He
turned back toward his tent, and even enclosed in the Void he gave
a start.</p>

<p>Aviendha had come out into the moonlight, a blanket
wrapped around her. Just beyond her stood a tall man shrouded in a
dark cloak; moonshadows drifted over a gaunt face that was too
pale, with eyes too large. A crooning rose, and the cloak opened
into wide, leathery wings like those of a bat. Moving as in a
dream, Aviendha drifted toward the waiting embrace.</p>

<p>Rand channeled, and finger-thin balefire burned past
her, an arrow of solid light, to take the Draghkar in the head. The
effect of that narrower stream was slower, but no less sure than
with the Darkhounds. The creature&rsquo;s colors reversed, black to
white, white to black, and it became sparkling motes that melted in
air.</p>

<p>Aviendha shook herself as the crooning ended, stared
at the last particles as they vanished, and turned to Rand,
gathering the blanket closer. Her hand came up, and a stream of
fire as thick as his head roared toward him.</p>

<p>Startled even inside the emptiness, never thinking of
the Power, he threw himself to the ground beneath the billowing
flames. They died in an instant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he barked, so angry, so
shocked, that the Void cracked and <em>saidin</em> vanished from
him. He scrambled to his feet, stalking toward her. &ldquo;This tops any
ingratitude I ever heard of!&rdquo; He was going to shake her until her
teeth rattled. &ldquo;I just saved your life, in case you failed to
notice, and if I offended some bloody Aiel custom, I don&rsquo;t give a&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next time,&rdquo; she snapped back, &ldquo;I will leave the
great <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> to deal with matters by himself!&rdquo;
Awkwardly clutching the blanket close, she ducked stiff-backed into
the tent.</p>

<p>For the first time, he looked behind him. At another
Draghkar, crumpled on the ground in flames. He had been so angry
that he had not heard the crackling and popping as it burned, had
not smelled the odor of burning grease. He had not even sensed the
evil of it. A Draghkar killed by first sucking the soul away, and
then life. It had to be close, touching, but this one lay no more
than two paces from where he had been standing. He was not certain
how effective a Draghkar&rsquo;s crooning embrace was against someone
filled with <em>saidin</em>, but he was glad he had not found
out.</p>

<p>Drawing a deep breath, he knelt beside the tent flap.
&ldquo;Aviendha?&rdquo; He could not go in. A lamp was lit in there, and she
could be sitting there naked for all he knew, mentally ripping him
up and down the way he deserved. &ldquo;Aviendha, I am sorry. I
apologize. I was a fool to speak as I did without asking why. I
should know that you wouldn&rsquo;t harm me, and I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m a
fool,&rdquo; he finished weakly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great deal you know, Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; came a muffled
reply. &ldquo;You <em>are</em> a fool!&rdquo;</p>

<p>How <em>did</em> Aiel apologize? He had never asked
her that. Considering <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>, teaching men to sing, and
wedding customs, he did not think he would. &ldquo;Yes, I am. And I
apologize.&rdquo; There was no answer this time. &ldquo;Are you in your
blankets?&rdquo; Silence.</p>

<p>Muttering to himself, he stood, working his
stockinged toes on the icy ground. He was going to have to remain
out here until he was sure she was decently covered. Without boots
or coat. He seized hold of <em>saidin</em>, taint and all, just to
be distanced from the bone-grinding cold, inside the Void.</p>

<p>The three Wise One dreamwalkers came running, of
course, and Egwene, all staring at the burning Draghkar as they
skirted it, drawing their shawls around them with almost the same
motion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only one,&rdquo; Amys said. &ldquo;I thank the Light, but I am
surprised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were two,&rdquo; Rand told her. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;destroyed
the other.&rdquo; Why should he be hesitant just because Moiraine had
warned him against balefire? It was a weapon like any other. &ldquo;If
Aviendha had not killed this one, it might have gotten me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The feel of her channeling drew us,&rdquo; Egwene said,
looking him up and down. At first he thought she was checking for
injuries, but she paid special attention to his stocking feet, then
glanced at the tent, where a crack in the tent flap showed
lamplight. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve upset her again, haven&rsquo;t you? She saved your
life, and you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Men!&rdquo; With a disgusted shake of her head, she
brushed past him and into the tent. He heard faint voices, but
could not make out what was being said.</p>

<p>Melaine gave a hitch to her shawl. &ldquo;If you do not
need us, then we must see what is happening below.&rdquo; She hurried off
without waiting for the other two.</p>

<p>Bair cackled as she and Amys followed. &ldquo;A wager on
who she will check on first? My amethyst necklace that you like so
much against that sapphire bracelet of yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done. I choose Dorindha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The older Wise One cackled again. &ldquo;Her eyes are still
full of Bael. A first-sister is a first-sister, but a new husband&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>They moved on out of earshot, and he bent toward the
tent flap. He still could not hear what they were saying, not
unless he stuck his ear to the crack, and he was not about to do
that. Surely Aviendha had covered herself with Egwene in there.
Then again, the way Egwene had taken to Aiel ways, it was just as
likely she had peeled out of her clothes instead.</p>

<p>The soft sound of slippers announced Moiraine and
Lan, and Rand straightened. Though he could hear both of them
breathing, the Warder&rsquo;s steps still made barely an audible noise.
Moiraine&rsquo;s hair hung about her face, and she held a dark robe
around her, the silk shining with the moon. Lan was fully dressed,
booted and armed, wrapped in that cloak that made him part of the
night. Of course. The clamor of fighting was dying down in the
hills below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am surprised you were not here sooner, Moiraine.&rdquo;
His voice sounded cold, but better his voice than him. He held onto
<em>saidin</em>, fought it, and the night&rsquo;s icy chill remained
something far off. He was aware of it, aware of each hair on his
arms stirring with cold beneath his shirtsleeves, but it did not
touch him. &ldquo;You usually come looking for me as soon as you sense
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never explained all that I do or do not do.&rdquo;
Her voice was as coolly mysterious as it had ever been, yet even in
the moonlight Rand was certain that she was blushing. Lan looked
troubled, though with him it was difficult to tell. &ldquo;I cannot hold
your hand forever. Eventually, you must walk alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did that tonight, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Embarrassment slid
across the Void&mdash;that sounded as though he had done
everything himself&mdash;and he added, &ldquo;Aviendha all but took that
one off my back.&rdquo; The flames on the Draghkar were burning low.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As well she was here, then,&rdquo; Moiraine said calmly.
&ldquo;You did not need me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had not been afraid, of that he was sure. He had
seen her rush into the midst of Shadowspawn, wielding the Power as
skillfully as Lan did his sword, seen it too often to believe fear
in her. So why had she not come when she sensed the Draghkar? She
could have, and Lan as well; that was one of the gifts a Warder
received from the bond between him and an Aes Sedai. He could make
her tell, catch her between her oath to him and her inability to
lie straight out. No, he could not. Or would not. He would not do
that to someone who was trying to help him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least now we know what the attack below was
about,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To make me think something important was
happening there while the Draghkar slipped in on me. They tried
that at Cold Rocks Hold, and it did not work there either.&rdquo; Only,
maybe it almost had, this time. If that <em>had</em> been the
intent. &ldquo;You would think they would try something different.&rdquo;
Couladin ahead of him; the Forsaken everywhere, it seemed. Why
could he not face one enemy at a time?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not make the mistake of thinking the Forsaken
simple,&rdquo; Moiraine said. &ldquo;That could easily be fatal.&rdquo; She shifted
her robe as though wishing it were thicker. &ldquo;The hour is late. If
you have no further need of me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aiel began to drift back as she and the Warder left.
Some exclaimed over the Draghkar, and roused some of the <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em> to drag it away, but most simply looked at it before
going to their tents. They seemed to expect such things of him
now.</p>

<p>When Adelin and the Maidens appeared, their
soft-booted feet dragged. They stared at the Draghkar being hauled
away by white-robed men, and exchanged long looks before
approaching Rand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was nothing here,&rdquo; Adelin said slowly. &ldquo;The
attack was all below, Darkfriends and Trollocs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shouting &lsquo;Sammael and the Golden Bees,&rsquo; I heard,&rdquo;
another added. With her head wrapped in a <em>shoufa</em>, Rand
could not make out who she was. She sounded young; some of the
Maidens were no more than sixteen.</p>

<p>Taking a deep breath, Adelin held out one of her
spears, horizontally in front of him, rock-steady. The others did
the same, one spear each. &ldquo;We&mdash;I&mdash;failed,&rdquo; Adelin said.
&ldquo;We should have been here when the Draghkar came. Instead we ran
like children to dance the spears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What am I supposed to do with those?&rdquo; Rand asked,
and Adelin replied without hesitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever you wish, <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>. We stand
ready, and will not resist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. <em>Bloody Aiel and their
bloody</em> ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh. &ldquo;You take those and go back to guarding my
tent. Well? Go.&rdquo; Looks passed between them before they began to
obey, as reluctantly as they had approached him in the first place.
&ldquo;And one of you tell Aviendha that I will be coming in when I
return,&rdquo; he added. He was not going to spend the entire night
outside wondering whether it was safe. He stalked away, the stony
ground hard under his feet.</p>

<p>Asmodean&rsquo;s tent was not very far from his. There had
not been a sound out of it. He whipped open the flap and ducked in.
Asmodean was sitting in the dark, chewing his lip. He flinched when
Rand appeared, and gave him no chance to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not expect me to take a hand, did you? I
felt the Draghkar, but you could deal with those; you did. I have
never liked Draghkar; we should never have made them. They have
fewer brains than a Trolloc. Give them an order, and they still
sometimes kill whatever is closest. If I had come out, if I had
done something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;What if someone noticed? What if they realized it
could not be you channeling? I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well for you that you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Rand cut him off,
sitting cross-legged in the dark. &ldquo;If I had felt you full of <em>
saidin</em> out there tonight, I might have killed you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other man&rsquo;s laugh was shaky. &ldquo;I thought of that,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Sammael who sent the attack tonight. The
Trollocs and Darkfriends, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not like Sammael to throw men away,&rdquo; Asmodean
said slowly. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;ll see ten thousand dead, or ten times that,
if it gains him what he thinks is worth the cost. Maybe one of the
others wants you to think it was him. Even if the Aiel took
prisoners&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Trollocs do not think of much besides killing, and
Darkfriends believe what they are told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was him. He tried to bait me into attacking him
once in the same way, at Serendahar.&rdquo; <em>Oh, Light!</em> The
thought drifted across the surface of the Void. <em>I said
&ldquo;me.&rdquo;</em> He did not know where Serendahar had been, or anything
but what he had said. The words had just come out.</p>

<p>After a long silence, Asmodean said quietly, &ldquo;I never
knew that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I want to know is, why?&rdquo; Rand chose his words
carefully, hoping that they were all his. He remembered Sammael&rsquo;s
face, a man&mdash;<em>Not mine. Not my memory</em>&mdash;a
compact man with a short yellow beard. Asmodean had described all
the Forsaken, but he knew this image was not made from that
description. Sammael had always wanted to be taller, and resented
it that the Power could not make him so. Asmodean had never told
him that. &ldquo;From what you&rsquo;ve told me, he is not likely to want to
face me unless he is sure of victory, and maybe not then. You said
he&rsquo;d likely leave me to the Dark One, if he could. So why is he
sure he&rsquo;ll win now, if I decide to go after him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They discussed it in the dark for hours without
coming to any conclusion. Asmodean held to the opinion that it had
been one of the others, hoping to send Rand against Sammael and
thus get rid of one or both; at least, Asmodean said that he did.
Rand could feel the man&rsquo;s dark eyes on him, wondering. That slip
had been too big to cover.</p>

<p>When he finally returned to his own tent, Adelin and
the dozen Maidens all sprang to their feet; all of them at once
telling him that Egwene was gone and Aviendha long asleep, that she
was angry with him, they both were. They gave so many different
pieces of advice on handling the two women&rsquo;s anger, all at the same
time, that he could understand none of it. Finally they fell
silent, looks passing between them, and Adelin spoke alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must speak of tonight. Of what we did, and what
we failed to do. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was nothing,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;and if it was
something, it&rsquo;s forgiven and forgotten. I would like to have a few
hours&rsquo; sleep for once. If you want to discuss it go talk to Amys or
Bair. I am sure they&rsquo;ll understand what you&rsquo;re after more than I
do.&rdquo; That shut them up, surprisingly, and let him get inside.</p>

<p>Aviendha was in her blankets, with one slim, bare leg
sticking out. He tried not to look at it, or her. She had left a
lamp lit. He climbed into his own blankets gratefully and channeled
the lamp out before releasing <em>saidin</em>. This time he dreamed
of Aviendha hurling fire, only she was not hurling it at a
Draghkar, and Sammael was sitting at her side, laughing.</p>
