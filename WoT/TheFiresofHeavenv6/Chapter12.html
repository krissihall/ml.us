<h4><em>An Old Pipe</em></h4>

gust of wind swirling dust down the Lugard street
caught Gareth Bryne&rsquo;s velvet hat, sweeping it from his head
directly under one of the lumbering wagons. An iron-rimmed wheel
ground the hat into the hard clay of the street, leaving a
flattened ruin behind. For a moment he stared at it, then walked
on. <em>It was showing travel stains anyway</em>, he told himself.
His silk coat had been dusty before reaching Murandy, too; brushing
no longer did much good, when he even took the trouble. It looked
more brown than gray, now. He should find something plainer; he was
not on his way to a ball.</p>

<p>Dodging between wagons rumbling down the rutted
street, he ignored the drivers&rsquo; curses that followed him&mdash;any
decent squadman could give better in his sleep&mdash;and ducked
into a red-roofed inn called The Wagon Seat. The painting on the
sign gave the name an explicit interpretation.</p>

<p>The common room was like every common room he had
seen in Lugard, wagon drivers and merchants&rsquo; guards packed in with
stablemen, farriers, laborers<em>,</em> every sort of man, all
talking or laughing as loud as they could while drinking as much as
they could, one hand for the cup and one to fondle the serving
girls. For that matter, it was not all that much different from
common rooms and taverns in many other towns, though most were
considerably milder. A buxom young woman, in a blouse that seemed
about to fall off, capered and sang atop a table at one side of the
room, to the supposed music of two flutes and a twelve-string
bittern.</p>

<p>He had little ear for music, but he paused a moment
to appreciate her song; she would have gone over well in any
soldiers&rsquo; camp he had ever seen. But then, she would have been as
popular if she could not sing a note. Wearing that blouse, she
would have found a husband in short order.</p>

<p>Joni and Barim were already there, Joni&rsquo;s size enough
to grant them a table by themselves despite his thin hair and the
bandage he still wore around his temples. They were listening to
the girl sing. Or at least staring at her. He touched each man on
the shoulder and nodded toward the side door that led to the
stableyard, where a sullen groom with a squint delivered their
horses for three silver pennies. A year or so earlier Bryne could
have bought a fair horse for no more. The troubles to the west and
in Cairhien were playing havoc with trade and prices.</p>

<p>No one spoke until they passed the city gates and
were on a seldom-traveled road winding north toward the River
Storn, little more than a wide dirt track. Then Barim said, &ldquo;They
was here yesterday, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bryne had learned that much himself. Three pretty
young women together, obvious outlanders, could not pass through a
city like Lugard without being remarked. By men, anyway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Them and a fellow with shoulders,&rdquo; Barim went on.
&ldquo;Sounds maybe like that Dalyn was with them when they burned down
Nem&rsquo;s barn. Anyway, whoever he is, they was at The Nine Horse Hitch
for a bit, but all they did was drink some and leave. That Domani
girl the lads was telling me about, she nearly kicked up a fuss
flashing her smile and swaying about, but then she calmed
everything down again the same way. Burn me, but I&rsquo;d like to meet
me a Domani woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear which way they went, Barim?&rdquo; Bryne
asked patiently. He had not been able to learn that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh, no, my Lord. But I heard there&rsquo;s been plenty of
Whitecloaks passing through, all heading west. You think maybe old
Pedron Niall&rsquo;s planning something? Maybe in Altara?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not our business anymore, Barim.&rdquo; Bryne knew
his patience sounded a little frayed this time, but Barim was an
old enough campaigner to stick to the matter at hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know where they went, my Lord,&rdquo; Joni said. &ldquo;West,
on the Jehannah Road, and pushing hard by what I heard.&rdquo; He sounded
troubled. &ldquo;My Lord, I found two merchant&rsquo;s guards, lads who used to
be in the Guards, and had a drink with them. Happens they were in a
stew called The Good Night&rsquo;s Ride when that girl Mara came in and
asked for a job singing. She didn&rsquo;t get it&mdash;didn&rsquo;t want to
show her legs the way the singers in most of these places do, as
who can blame her?&mdash;and she left. From what Barim told me, it
was right after that they all set off west. I don&rsquo;t like it, my
Lord. She isn&rsquo;t the kind of girl to want a job in a place like
that. I think she&rsquo;s trying to get away from that Dalyn fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Strangely, despite the lump on his head, Joni had no
animosity toward the three young women. It was his opinion, often
expressed since leaving the manor, that the girls were in some sort
of predicament and needed to be rescued. Bryne suspected that if he
did catch up to the young women and take them back to his estate,
Joni would be after him to turn them over to Joni&rsquo;s daughters to
mother.</p>

<p>Barim had no such feelings. &ldquo;Ghealdan.&rdquo; He scowled.
&ldquo;Or maybe Altara, or Amadicia. We&rsquo;ll kiss the Dark One getting them
back. Hardly seems worth the annoyance for a barn and some
cows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bryne said nothing. They had followed the girl this
far, and Murandy was a bad place for Andormen; too many border
troubles over too many years. Only a fool would chase into Murandy
after an oathbreaker&rsquo;s eyes. How much bigger a fool to follow
halfway across the world?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those lads I talked to,&rdquo; Joni said diffidently. &ldquo;My
Lord, it seems a lot of the old lads who&mdash;who served under
you are being sent off.&rdquo; Emboldened by Bryne&rsquo;s silence, he went on.
&ldquo;Lots of new fellows in. Lots. Those lads said at least four or
five for everyone told he wasn&rsquo;t wanted anymore. The sort that like
to cause trouble more than stop it. There&rsquo;s some calling themselves
the White Lions who only answer to this Gaebril&rdquo;&mdash;he spat to
show what he thought of <em>that</em>&mdash;&ldquo;and a bunch more not
part of the Guards at all. Not House levies. Near as they could
say, Gaebril&rsquo;s got ten times as many men under arms as there are
Guards, and they&rsquo;ve all sworn to the throne of Andor, but not to
the Queen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no longer our business, either,&rdquo; Bryne said
curtly. Barim had his tongue stuffed into his cheek, the way he
always did when he knew something he either did not want to tell or
was not sure was important enough. &ldquo;What is it, Barim? Out with it,
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The leather-faced fellow stared at him in amazement.
Barim had never figured out how Bryne knew he was holding back.
&ldquo;Well, my Lord, some of the folks I talked to said some of those
Whitecloaks yesterday was asking questions. About a girl sounds
like that Mara. Wanted to know who she was, where she went. Like
that. I heard they got real interested when they learned she was
gone. If they&rsquo;re after her, she could be hanged before we ever find
her. If they have to go to the trouble of chasing her down, they
might not ask too many questions about whether she&rsquo;s really a
Darkfriend. Or whatever it is they&rsquo;re after her for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bryne frowned. Whitecloaks? What would the Children
of the Light want with Mara? He would never believe she was a
Darkfriend. But then, he had seen a baby-faced young fellow hanged
in Caemlyn, a Darkfriend who had been teaching children in the
streets about the glories of the Dark One&mdash;the Great Lord of
the Dark, he had called him. The lad had killed nine of them in
three years, as near as could be discovered, when they looked like
turning him in. <em>No. That girl is no Darkfriend, and I&rsquo;ll
stake my life on it</em>. Whitecloaks were suspicious of everyone.
And if they took it into their heads that she had fled Lugard to
avoid them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He booted Traveler to a canter. The big-nosed bay
gelding was not flashy, but he had endurance, and courage. The
other two caught up soon enough, and they kept their mouths shut,
seeing the mood he was in.</p>

<p>Two miles or so from Lugard, he turned off into a
thicket of oak and leatherleaf. The rest of his men had made a
temporary camp here, in a clear space under thick, spreading oak
limbs. Several small, smokeless fires were burning; they would take
any opportunity to brew up some tea. Some were dozing; sleep was
another thing an old soldier never missed a chance to snatch.</p>

<p>Those awake kicked the rest out of their naps, and
they all looked up at him. For a moment he sat his saddle studying
them. Gray hair and bald heads and age creased faces. Still hard
and fit, but even so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He had been a fool to risk bringing them
into Murandy just because he had to know why a woman had broken an
oath. And maybe with Whitecloaks after them. No telling how far or
how long from home before it was done. If he turned back now, they
would have been gone more than a month before they saw Kore Springs
again. If he went on, there was no guarantee the chase would stop
short of the Aryth Ocean. He should be taking these men, and
himself, home. He should. He had no call to ask them to try
snatching those girls out of Whitecloak hands. He could leave Mara
to Whitecloak justice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will be heading west,&rdquo; he announced, and
immediately there was a scramble of dousing fires with the tea and
fastening pots to saddles. &ldquo;We will have to press hard. I mean to
catch them in Altara, if I can, but if not, there&rsquo;s no telling
where they&rsquo;ll lead us. You could see Jehannah or Amador or Ebou Dar
before we&rsquo;re done.&rdquo; He affected a laugh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find out how tough
you are if we reach Ebou Dar. They&rsquo;ve taverns there where the
barmaids skin Illianers for dinner and spit Whitecloaks for
sport.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They laughed harder than the jest was worth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t worry with you along, my Lord,&rdquo; Thad
cackled, stuffing his tin cup into his saddlebags. His face was
wrinkled like crumpled leather. &ldquo;Why, I hear you had a run-in with
the Amyrlin herself once, and&mdash;&rdquo; Jar Silvin kicked him on the
ankle, and he rounded on the younger man&mdash;gray-haired, but
still younger&mdash;with a clenched fist. &ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you do that,
Silvin? You want a broke head, you just&mdash;What?&rdquo; The
meaningful glares Silvin and some of the others were giving him
finally sank in. &ldquo;Oh. Oh, yes.&rdquo; He buried himself in checking the
girth straps on his saddle, but no one was laughing anymore.</p>

<p>Bryne forced his face to relax from stoniness. It was
time he put the past in the past. Just because a woman whose bed he
had shared&mdash;and more, he had thought&mdash;just because that
woman looked at him as though she had never known him was no reason
to stop speaking her name. Just because she had exiled him from
Caemlyn, on pain of death, for giving her the advice he had sworn
to give&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;If she came a cropper with this Lord Gaebril who had
suddenly appeared in Caemlyn, it was no longer any concern of his.
She had told him, in a voice as flat and cold as smooth ice, that
his name would never be spoken in the palace again, that only his
long service kept her from sending him to the headsman for treason.
Treason! He needed to keep spirits up, especially if this turned
into a long chase.</p>

<p>Hooking a knee around the high cantle of his saddle,
he took out his pipe and pouch and filled his pipe with tabac. The
bowl was carved with a wild bull collared with the Rose Crown of
Andor. For a thousand years that had been the sign of House Bryne;
strength and courage in service of the queen. He needed a new pipe;
this one was old.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come out of that as well as you might have
heard.&rdquo; He leaned down for one of the men to hand him a twig still
glowing from one of the spent fires, then straightened to puff his
pipe alight. &ldquo;It was some three years ago. The Amyrlin was making a
progression. Cairhien, Tear, Illian, and finishing up in Caemlyn
before returning to Tar Valon. At that time we were having problems
with Murandian border lords&mdash;as usual.&rdquo; Laughter rippled;
they had all served on the Murandian border at one time or another.
&ldquo;I had sent some of the Guards down to set the Murandians straight
on who owned the sheep and cattle on our side of the border. I
never expected the Amyrlin to take an interest.&rdquo; He certainly had
their attention; preparations to leave were still going on, but
more slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Siuan Sanche and Elaida closeted themselves with
Morgase&mdash;&rdquo; There; he had said her name again, and it did not
even smart. &ldquo;&mdash;and when they came out, Morgase was half
thunderhead, with lightning shooting out of her eyes, and half
ten-year-old who&rsquo;d been hauled up by her mother for stealing
honeycakes. She&rsquo;s a tough woman, but caught between Elaida and the
Amyrlin Seat&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He shook his head, and they chuckled; Aes Sedai
attentions were one thing none of them envied lords and rulers.
&ldquo;She ordered me to remove all troops from the border with Murandy
immediately. I asked her to discuss it with me in private, and
Siuan Sanche jumped all over me. In front of half the court, she
chewed me up one side and down the other like a raw recruit. Said
if I couldn&rsquo;t do as I was told, she&rsquo;d use me for fishbait.&rdquo; He had
had to beg her pardon before it was done&mdash;in front of
everyone, for trying to do as he had been sworn to do&mdash;but
there was no need to add that. Even at the end he had not been sure
that she would not make Morgase behead him, or have it done
herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must have meant to catch herself a mighty big fish,&rdquo;
someone laughed, and others joined in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The upshot was,&rdquo; Bryne went on, &ldquo;my hide got singed,
and the Guards were ordered back from the border. So if you&rsquo;re
looking to me to protect you in Ebou Dar, just remember it&rsquo;s my
opinion those barmaids would hang the Amyrlin out to dry along with
the rest of us.&rdquo; They roared with mirth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever find out what it was about, my Lord?&rdquo;
Joni wanted to know.</p>

<p>Bryne shook his head. &ldquo;Aes Sedai business of some
sort, I expect. They don&rsquo;t tell the likes of you and me what they
are up to.&rdquo; That earned a few chuckles as well.</p>

<p>They mounted up with an alacrity that belied their
ages. <em>Some of them are no older than me</em>, he thought wryly.
Too old to go chasing after a pretty pair of eyes young enough to
be his daughter&rsquo;s if not his granddaughter&rsquo;s. <em>I only want to
know why she broke oath</em>, he told himself firmly. <em>Only
that</em>.</p>

<p>Raising his hand, he signaled forward, and they
headed west, leaving a trail of dust. It would take hard riding to
catch up. But he meant to. In Ebou Dar or the Pit of Doom, he would
find them.</p>
