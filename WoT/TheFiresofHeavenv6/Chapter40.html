<h4><em>The Wheel Weaves</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s
soon as the building hid Galad, Nynaeve&rsquo;s eyes
darted down the street ahead. Fury bubbled up, at herself as much
as Galadedrid Damodred. <em>You witless wool-head!</em> It was a
narrow way like all the rest, paved with rounded stones, lined with
gray shops and houses and taverns, populated with a scattered
afternoon crowd. <em>If you hadn&rsquo;t come into town, he&rsquo;d never have
found you!</em> Too scattered to hide anyone. <em>You had to go see
the Prophet! You had to go believing the Prophet would whisk you
away before Moghedien gets here! When are you going to learn you
can&rsquo;t depend on anyone but yourself?</em> In an instant she made
her choice. When Galad turned that corner and did not see them, he
would begin looking into shops, and maybe taverns as well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way.&rdquo; Gathering her skirts, she darted into the
nearest alley and pressed her back against the wall. No one glanced
at her twice, furtive as she was, and what that had to say about
the way things were in Samara she did not want to consider. Uno and
Ragan were beside her before she finished setting her feet,
crowding her farther down the dusty dirt alleyway, past an old
splintered bucket and a rain barrel dried to the point of collapse
inside its hoops. At least they were doing what she wanted. In a
manner of speaking. Tense hands on long sword hilts rising above
their shoulders, they were ready to protect her whether she desired
it or not<em>. Let them, you fool! Do you think you can protect
yourself?</em></p>

<p>She was certainly angry enough. Galad, of all people!
She should never have left the menagerie! A fool whim, and one that
might ruin everything. She could no more channel here than against
Masema. Just the possibility that Moghedien or Black sisters were
in Samara made her dependent on two men for her safety. It was
enough to screw her anger tight; she could have chewed a hole in
the stone wall behind her. She knew why Aes Sedai had Warders&mdash;all but Reds, anyway. In her head, she did. In her heart, it
just made her want to snarl.</p>

<p>Galad appeared, threading his way slowly through the
folk out in the street, eyes searching. By all reason, be should
have gone on by&mdash;he should have&mdash;yet almost immediately
his gaze settled on the alleyway. On them. He did not even have the
grace to appear pleased or surprised.</p>

<p>Uno and Ragan moved together as Galad turned toward
the alley. The one-eyed man had his sword out in the blink of an
eye, and Ragan was scarcely slower for all he paused to push her
deeper into the narrow passage. They positioned themselves one
behind the other; should Galad make it past Uno, he would still
have Ragan to face.</p>

<p>Nynaeve ground her teeth. She could make all these
swords unnecessary, useless; she could sense the True Source, like
a light unseen over her shoulder, waiting for her embrace. She
could do it. If she dared.</p>

<p>Galad stopped at the alley mouth, cloak thrown back,
one hand resting nonchalantly on his sword hilt, a picture of
spring-steel grace. Except for his burnished mail, he could have
been at a ball.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not want to kill either of you, Shienaran,&rdquo; he
said calmly to Uno. Nynaeve had heard Elayne and Gawyn speak of
Galad&rsquo;s sword skill, but for the first time she realized that he
might really be as good as they said. At least, he thought he was.
Two seasoned soldiers with blades bare, and he eyed them as a
wolfhound would eye a pair of lesser dogs, not seeking a fight yet
utterly confident he could take both. Never quite looking away from
the two men, he addressed her. &ldquo;Someone else might have run into a
shop or an inn, but you never do what is expected. Will you let me
speak with you? There is no need to make me kill these men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>None of the passersby were stopping, but even with
three men blocking her view she could see heads swiveling for a
glimpse of what had drawn the Whitecloak. And plainly taking in the
swords. Rumors would be hatching in all those minds and taking
flight on wings that made dusk swallows seem slow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him by,&rdquo; she commanded. When Uno and Ragan did
not budge, she repeated herself, even more firmly. They did move
aside then, slowly, as much as the narrow alley would allow, yet
though neither said a word, there was an air of muttering about
them. Galad came by smoothly, seeming to forget the Shienarans. She
suspected that believing so would be a mistake; the top-knotted men
plainly did not.</p>

<p>Aside from one of the Forsaken, she could not imagine
a man she would less like to see right then, but with that face in
front of her, she was all too conscious of her own, breathing, her
own heartbeat. It was ludicrous. Why could the man not be ugly? Or
at least plain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You knew I knew that you were following.&rdquo; Accusation
rang strongly in her voice, though she was not sure what she was
accusing him of. Not doing what she had expected and wanted, she
imagined ruefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assumed as much as soon as I recognized you,
Nynaeve. I remember that you generally see more than you let
on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She would not let him divert her with compliments.
Look where that had gotten her with Valan Luca. &ldquo;What are you doing
in Ghealdan? I thought you were on your way to Altara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment he stared down at her with those dark,
beautiful eyes, then abruptly laughed. &ldquo;In all the world, Nynaeve,
only you would ask me the question I should be asking you. Very
well. I&rsquo;ll answer you, for all it should be the other way round. I
did have orders for Salidar, in Altara, but all changed when this
Prophet fellow&mdash;What is the matter? Are you unwell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve forced her face to smoothness. &ldquo;Of course
not,&rdquo; she said irritably. &ldquo;My health is quite good, thank you very
kindly.&rdquo; Salidar! Of course! The name was like one of Aludra&rsquo;s
firesticks going off in her head. All of that racking of her brain,
and Galad casually handed her what she had been unable to dig up on
her own. Now if only Masema found a ship quickly. If only she could
make sure Galad would not betray them. Without letting Uno and
Ragan kill him, of course. Whatever Elayne said, Nynaeve could not
believe she would appreciate having her brother cut down. Small
chance he would believe Elayne was not with her. &ldquo;I just cannot get
over my shock at seeing you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A small patch on mine, when I learned you had
slipped out of Sienda.&rdquo; Sternness became that handsome face to an
unfortunate degree, but his tone offset it. Somewhat. He could have
been lecturing a small girl who had sneaked out of the house after
her bedtime to climb trees. &ldquo;I was sick near to death with worry.
What under the Light possessed you? Have you any idea of the risks
you ran? And to come here, of all places. Elayne always chooses to
saddle a horse at the gallop if she can, but I thought that you, at
least, had more sense. This so-called Prophet&mdash;&rdquo; He cut off,
eyeing the other two men. Uno had grounded his sword-point, scarred
hands folded atop the pommel. Ragan appeared to be inspecting his
blade&rsquo;s edge to the exclusion of everything else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard rumors,&rdquo; Galad went on slowly, &ldquo;that he
is Shienaran. You <em>cannot</em> have been witless enough to get
yourself mixed up with him.&rdquo; There was too much question in that
for her taste by far.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither of them is the Prophet, Galad,&rdquo; she said
wryly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known them both for some little time, and I can assure
you of that. Uno, Ragan, unless you intend to prune your toenails,
put those things up. Well?&rdquo; They hesitated before doing as they
were told, Uno grumping under his breath and glaring, but they did
it finally. Men usually responded to a firm voice. Most did.
Sometimes, anyway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hardly thought they were, Nynaeve.&rdquo; Galad&rsquo;s tone,
even more arid than hers, made her bristle, but when he went on, he
sounded annoyed rather than superior. And worried. Which made her
bristle even more, of course. <em>He</em> all but gave her
palpitations, and <em>he</em> had the nerve to be worried. &ldquo;I do
not know what you and Elayne have fallen into here, and I do not
care, so long as I can extract you from it before you are hurt.
Trade is slow on the, river, but a suitable boat of some sort
should call in the next few days. Let me know where I can find you,
and I will secure you passage to somewhere in Altara. From there,
you can make your way to Caemlyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gaped in spite of herself. &ldquo;You mean to find us a
ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all I can do, now.&rdquo; He sounded apologetic, and
shook his head as if arguing with himself. &ldquo;I cannot escort you to
safety; my duty is here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t want to take you from your duty,&rdquo; she
said, a touch breathless. If he wanted to misunderstand, let him.
The most she had hoped for was that he would leave them be.</p>

<p>He seemed to feel the need to defend himself. &ldquo;It is
hardly safe to send you off alone, but a boat will take you away
before the entire border explodes. Which it will, soon or late; all
it needs is one spark, and the Prophet is sure to strike it if no
one else does. You must see to setting yourselves to Caemlyn, you
and Elayne. All I ask is your promise that you will go there. The
Tower is no place for either of you. Or for&mdash;&rdquo; He clamped his
teeth shut, but he might as well have gone ahead and named
Egwene.</p>

<p>It could not hurt, having Galad looking for a boat
too. If Masema could forget whether he intended to close the
taverns, he could forget to have anyone find a riverboat.
Especially if he thought a convenient bout of forgetfulness might
keep her there to further his own plans. It could not hurt&mdash;if she could trust Galad. If she could not, then she would have to
hope he was not as good with that sword as he thought he was. A
stark thought, but not so stark as what might happen&mdash;<em>would</em> happen&mdash;if he proved untrustworthy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am what I am, Galad, and Elayne is the same.&rdquo;
Dodging around Masema had put a bad taste on her tongue. A little
White Tower sidestepping was as close as she could come. &ldquo;And you
are what you are, now.&rdquo; She raised her eyebrows significantly at
his white cloak. &ldquo;That lot hates the Tower, and they hate women who
can channel. Now that you are one of them, why shouldn&rsquo;t I think
there will be fifty of you after me inside the hour, trying to put
an arrow in my back if they can&rsquo;t haul me off to a cell? Me, and
Elayne as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Galad&rsquo;s head jerked in irritation. Or maybe he was
offended. &ldquo;How often must I tell you? I would never let harm come
to my sister. Or to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It truly was annoying, realizing that she was annoyed
at the pause that made it clear she was an afterthought. She was
not some silly girl, to lose her wits because a man had eyes that
somehow managed to be melting and incredibly penetrating at the
same time. &ldquo;If you say it so,&rdquo; she told him, and his head tossed
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me where you are put up, and I will bring word,
or send it, as soon as I locate a suitable vessel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Elayne was right, he could no more lie than could
an Aes Sedai who had sworn the Three Oaths, but still she
hesitated. A mistake here could be her last. She had a right to
take risks for herself, but this risk involved Elayne too. And Thom
and Juilin, for that matter; they were her responsibility, whatever
they wanted to think. But she was here, and the decision had to be
hers. Not that it might be any other way, frankly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light, woman, what more do you want of me?&rdquo; Galad
growled, half-raising his hands as though to grab her shoulders.
Uno&rsquo;s blade was between them in a flash of bright steel, but
Elayne&rsquo;s brother actually brushed it aside like a twig, and paid it
no more mind than one. &ldquo;I mean no harm to you, now or ever; I swear
it by my mother&rsquo;s name. You say that you are what you are? I know
what you are. And what you are not. Perhaps half the reason I wear
this,&rdquo; he touched an edge of his snowy cloak, &ldquo;is because the Tower
sent you out&mdash;you and Elayne and Egwene&mdash;for the Light
knows what reason, when you are what you are. It was like sending a
boy who has just learned to hold a sword into battle, and I will
never forgive them. There is still time for both of you to turn
aside; you do not have to carry that sword. The Tower is too
dangerous for you or my sister, especially now. Half the world is
become too dangerous for you! Let me help you to safety.&rdquo; The
tightness slid from his voice, though it took on a raw edge. &ldquo;I beg
you, Nynaeve. If anything happened to Elayne&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I half-wish that
Egwene were with you, so I could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Scrubbing a hand through
his hair, he looked left and right, searching for how to convince
her. Uno and Ragan held their blades ready to drive through his
body, but he did not appear to see them. &ldquo;In the name of the Light,
Nynaeve, please allow me to do what I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a simple thing that finally tipped the balance
in her mind. They were in Ghealdan. Amadicia was the only land that
actually made a crime out of a woman being able to channel, and
they were on the opposite bank of the river. That left only Galad&rsquo;s
oaths as a Child of the Light to battle against his duty to Elayne.
She gave blood the edge in that struggle. Besides, he really was
too gorgeous for her to let Uno and Ragan kill him. Not that that
had anything to do with her decision, of course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are with Valan Luca&rsquo;s show,&rdquo; she said at
last.</p>

<p>He blinked at her, frowned. &ldquo;Valan Luca&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? You
mean one of the menageries?&rdquo; Incredulity and disgust fought in his
voice. &ldquo;What under the Light are you doing in company like that?
Those who keep such shows are no better than&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;No matter. If
you need coin, I can supply some. Enough to see you in a decent
inn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His tone bespoke his certainty that she would do as
he wanted. Not a &ldquo;can I help you with a few crowns?&rdquo; or a &ldquo;would
you like me to find a room for you?&rdquo; He thought they should be in
an inn, so into an inn they would go. The man might have observed
enough to know she would duck into an alley, but he did not know
her at all, it seemed. Besides, there were reasons to stay with
Luca.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think there is a room, or a hayloft, not
taken in all of Samara?&rdquo; she asked, a touch more tartly than
intended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am certain I can find&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She cut him off. &ldquo;The last place anyone would look
for us is among the shows.&rdquo; The last place anyone but Moghedien
would look, at least. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll agree we should keep from sight as
much as possible? If you <em>did</em> find a room, more than likely
you&rsquo;d have to have someone put out of it. A Child of the Light
securing a room so for two women? That would set tongues wagging
and draw eyes like flies to a midden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not like it, grimacing, and glaring at Uno
and Ragan as if it were their fault, but he had enough sense to
see sense. &ldquo;It is no fit place for either of you, but it is
probably safer than anywhere inside the city at that. Since you
have at least agreed to go to Caemlyn, I will say no more on
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She kept her face smooth and let him think as he
wished. If he thought she had promised what she had not, that was
his affair. She had to keep him away from the show as much as
possible, though. One glimpse of his sister in those spangled white
breeches, and the uproar would overshadow any riot Masema could
raise. &ldquo;You will have to stay clear of the menagerie, mind. Until
you find a ship, anyway. Then come to the performers&rsquo; wagons at
nightfall and ask for Nana.&rdquo; He liked that even less, if possible,
but she forestalled him firmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not seen a single Child of
the Light near any of the shows. If you visit one, don&rsquo;t you think
people will notice and ask why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His smile was still gorgeous, but it showed too many
teeth. &ldquo;You have an answer for everything, it seems. Do you have
any objection to my escorting you back there, at least?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I most certainly do. There will be rumors as it is&mdash;a hundred people must have noticed us talking here&rdquo;&mdash;she could no longer see the street past the three men, yet she had
no doubt passersby were still glancing into the alley, and Uno and
Ragan had not resheathed their swords&mdash;&ldquo;but if you accompany
me, we&rsquo;ll be seen by ten times as many.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His wince was half rueful, half mirthful. &ldquo;An answer
for everything,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;But you have the right of it.&rdquo;
Clearly he wished she did not. &ldquo;Hear me, Shienarans,&rdquo; he said,
turning his head, and suddenly his voice was steel. &ldquo;I am
Galadedrid Damodred, and this woman is under my protection. As for
her companion, I would count it small loss to die in order to save
her the smallest harm. If you allow either to come to that smallest
harm, I will find you both and kill you.&rdquo; Ignoring the sudden,
dangerous blankness of their faces as completely as he did their
swords, he swung his eyes back to her. &ldquo;I suppose you still will
not tell me where Egwene is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All you need know is that she is far from here.&rdquo;
Folding her arms beneath her breasts, she could feel her heart
beating through her ribs. Was she making a dangerous mistake
because of a pretty face? &ldquo;And safer than any action of yours can
make her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked as if he did not believe her, but he made
no more of it. &ldquo;With luck, I will find a vessel in a day or two.
Until then, stay close to this Valan Luca&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;show. Stay low
and avoid notice. As much as you can with your hair that color. And
tell Elayne not to run away from me again. The Light shone on you
to let me find you still in one piece, and it will have to shine
twice as brightly to keep you from harm if you try haring off
across Ghealdan. This Prophet&rsquo;s blasphemous ruffians are
everywhere, without respect for law or persons, and that does not
count brigands taking advantage of disorder. Samara itself is a
wasp nest, but if you will sit quietly and convince my headstrong
sister to do the same I will find a way to get you out of it before
you are stung.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was an effort to keep her mouth shut. Taking what
she told him and making it an injunction to her! Next thing the man
would want to pack her and Elayne in wool and sit them on a shelf!
<em>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be best if someone did?</em> a tiny voice asked.
<em>Haven&rsquo;t you caused enough trouble going your own way?</em> She
told the voice to be quiet. It did not listen, but began listing
disasters and near disasters sprung from her own stubbornness.</p>

<p>Apparently taking her silence for acquiescence, he
turned away from her&mdash;and stopped. Ragan and Uno had moved to
block his way to the street, glancing at her with that strange,
deceptive calm men so often adopted when they were a hairsbreadth
from sudden violence. The air seemed to crackle, until she motioned
hurriedly. The Shienarans lowered their blades and stood aside, and
Galad took his hands from his sword, brushed past them and melded
into the crowd without a backward glance.</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave Uno and Ragan each a good glare before
stalking off in the opposite direction. There she had had
everything arranged properly, and they had to nearly ruin it all.
Men always seemed to think violence could solve anything. If she
had had a stout stick, she would have thumped all three of them
about the shoulders until they saw reason.</p>

<p>The Shienarans seemed to see a little of it, now;
they caught up to her, swords scabbarded on their backs once more,
and followed without a word, even when she twice took a wrong turn
and had to double back. It was especially well for them that they
kept silent then. She had had enough of holding her tongue. First
Masema, and then Galad. All she wanted was a wafer-thin excuse to
tell someone exactly what she thought. Especially that little voice
in her head, pushed back to an insect buzz now but refusing to be
quiet.</p>

<p>By the time they were out of Samara and on that dirt
cart track, with its sparse traffic, the voice refused to be
denied. She worried over Rand&rsquo;s arrogance, but hers had brought
herself and others as near calamity as made no never mind. For
Birgitte, perhaps it was well over the line, even if she was alive.
The best thing was for Nynaeve not to confront them again, not the
Black Ajah and not Moghedien, not until someone who knew what they
were doing could decide what should be done. Protest welled up, but
she stamped on it as firmly as she ever had on Thom or Juilin. She
would go to Salidar and hand the matter over to the Blues. That was
how it would be. She was set on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you eaten something that disagrees with you?&rdquo;
Ragan said. &ldquo;Your mouth is twisted as if you had chewed a ripe
duckberry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave him a look that snapped his teeth shut and
stalked on. The two Shienarans kept pace to either side.</p>

<p>What was she going to do with them? That she should
put them to some use was never in doubt; their appearance was too
providential to throw away. For one thing, two additional pairs of
eyes&mdash;well, three eyes anyway; she was going to learn to look
at that patch without swallowing if it killed her&mdash;more eyes
hunting for a ship might mean finding one sooner. All very well if
Masema or Galad found a vessel first, but she did not want either
to know more of her doings than she had to allow. There was no
telling what either might do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you following me because Masema told you to look
after me,&rdquo; she demanded, &ldquo;or because Galad did?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What flaming difference does it make?&rdquo; Uno muttered.
&ldquo;If the Lord Dragon has summoned you, you bloody well&mdash;&rdquo; He
cut off, frowning, as she raised one finger. Ragan eyed it as if it
were a weapon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to help Elayne and me reach Rand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve nothing better to do,&rdquo; Ragan said dryly. &ldquo;As
it is, we&rsquo;ll not see Shienar again till we are gray and toothless.
We might as well ride with you to Tear or wherever he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had not considered that, but it made sense. Two
more to help Thom and Juilin with chores and standing guard. No
need to let them know how long that might take, or how many stops
and detours could lie along the way. The Blues in Salidar might not
let any of them go further. Once they reached Aes Sedai, they would
be only Accepted again. <em>Stop thinking about it! You</em> are
<em>going to do it!</em></p>

<p>The crowd waiting in front of Luca&rsquo;s garish sign
appeared no smaller than it had before. A stream of people trickled
into the meadow to join the throng as another stream meandered out,
exclaiming over what they had seen. Now and again the &ldquo;boar-horses&rdquo;
were visible, rearing above the canvas wall, to <em>oohs</em> and
<em>aahs</em> from those waiting to get in. Cerandin was putting
them through their paces again. The Seanchan woman always saw that
the <em>s&rsquo;redit</em> got plenty of rest. She was very firm about
that, whatever Luca wanted. Men <em>did</em> do as they were told
when you left no doubt that anything else was inconceivable.
Usually they did.</p>

<p>Short of the well-trampled brown grass, Nynaeve
stopped and turned to face the two Shienarans. She kept her face
calm, but they looked suitably wary, though in Uno&rsquo;s case,
regrettably, that involved fiddling with his eye-patch in a
queasy-making way. The folk heading to or from the show paid no
heed to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it will not be because of Masema <em>or</em>
Galad,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;If you are going to travel with me, you
will do as <em>I</em> say, else you can go your own way, for I&rsquo;ll
have none of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course they had to exchange glances before nodding
acceptance. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s how it flaming has to be,&rdquo; Uno growled,
&ldquo;then well enough. If you don&rsquo;t have somebody to bloody well look
after you, you&rsquo;ll never flaming live to reach the Lord Dragon. Some
sheep-gutted farmer will have you for breakfast because of your
tongue.&rdquo; Ragan gave him a guarded look that said be agreed with
every word but strongly doubted Uno&rsquo;s wisdom in voicing them.
Ragan, it seemed, had the makings of a wise man in him.</p>

<p>If they accepted her terms, it did not really matter
why. For now. There would be plenty of time later to set them
straight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt the others will agree, too,&rdquo; Ragan
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Others?&rdquo; she said, blinking. &ldquo;You mean there are
more than the two of you? How many?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are only fifteen of us altogether now. I don&rsquo;t
think Bartu or Nengar will come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sniffing after the bloody <em>Prophet</em>.&rdquo; Uno
turned his head and spat copiously. &ldquo;Only fifteen. Sar went over
that bloody cliff in the mountains, and Mendao had to get himself
into a flaming duel with three Hunters for the Horn, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve was too busy stopping herself from gaping to
listen. Fifteen! She could not help toting up in her head what it
would cost to feed fifteen men. Even when they were not
particularly hungry, Thom or Juilin either one ate more than Elayne
and her combined. Light!</p>

<p>On the other hand, with fifteen Shienaran soldiers,
there was no need to wait for a ship. A riverboat was certainly the
fastest way to travel&mdash;she remembered what she had heard of
Salidar, now; a river town, or close by; a boat could take them
right to it&mdash;yet a Shienaran escort would make their wagon
just as safe, from Whitecloaks or bandits or followers of the
Prophet. But much slower. And a lone wagon heading away from Samara
with such an escort would certainly stand out. A signpost for
Moghedien, or the Black Ajah. <em>I will let the Blues deal with
them, and that is that!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;What is wrong?&rdquo; Ragan asked, and Uno added
apologetically, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have mentioned how Sakaru died.&rdquo;
Sakaru? That must have been after she stopped listening. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
spend much time around fla&mdash;around ladies. I forget you have
weak bell&mdash;I mean, uh, delicate stomachs.&rdquo; If he did not stop
tugging at that eye-patch he was going to find out how delicate her
stomach was.</p>

<p>The number changed nothing. If two Shienarans were
good, fifteen were wonderful. Her own private army. No need to
worry about Whitecloaks or brigands or riots, or whether she had
made a mistake about Galad. How many hams could fifteen men eat
every day? A firm voice. &ldquo;Right, then. Every night just after dark,
one of you&mdash;one, mind!&mdash;will come here and ask for
Nana. That&rsquo;s the name I am known by.&rdquo; She had no reason for the
order, except to put them in the habit of doing what she told them.
&ldquo;Elayne goes by Morelin, but you ask for Nana. If you need coin,
come to me, not Masema.&rdquo; She had to suppress a wince as the words
left her mouth. There was still gold in the wagon&rsquo;s stove, but Luca
had not demanded his hundred gold crowns yet, and he would. There
was always the jewelry, if need be, though. She had to be sure they
were weaned away from Masema. &ldquo;Aside from that, none of you are to
come near me, or the show.&rdquo; Without that, they would likely set a
guard, or some such idiocy. &ldquo;Not unless a riverboat arrives. In
that case, you come running on the instant. Do you understand
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Uno muttered. &ldquo;Why do we flaming have to keep
away&mdash;?&rdquo; His head jerked back as her admonitory finger almost
touched his nose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember what I said about your language?&rdquo;
She had to make herself give him a level look; that glaring red
eye-patch made her stomach do flips. &ldquo;Unless you do remember, you
will learn why men in the Two Rivers have decent tongues in their
mouths.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She watched him turn that over in his mind. He did
not know what her connection with the White Tower was, only that it
existed. She might be an agent of the Tower, or Tower-trained. Or
even Aes Sedai, though one not long to the shawl. And the threat
was vague enough for him to put his own worst interpretation to it.
She had known that technique long before hearing Juilin mention it
to Elayne.</p>

<p>When it appeared the idea had taken hold&mdash;and
before he could ask any questions&mdash;she lowered her hand. &ldquo;You
will stay away for the same reason Galad does. So as not to draw
attention. For the rest, you will do it because I say so. If I must
explain my every decision to you, I&rsquo;ll have time for nothing else,
so you must make the best of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was a suitably Aes Sedai comment. Besides, they
had no choice if they intended to help her reach Rand, as they
thought, which meant they had no choice. All in all, she was
feeling quite satisfied with herself as she shooed them off back
toward Samara and strode past the waiting crowd and under the sign
bearing Valan Luca&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>To her surprise, there was an addition to the show.
On a new platform not far from the entry, a woman in gauzy yellow
trousers was standing on her head, arms outstretched to either side
with a pair of white doves on each hand. No, not on her head. The
woman was gripping some sort of wooden frame in her <em>teeth</em>
and balancing on that. As Nynaeve watched, aghast, the peculiar
acrobat lowered her hands to the platform for a moment while
bending herself double, until she seemed to be sitting on her own
head. Even that was not enough. Her legs curved down in front of
her, then impossibly back up under her arms, whereupon she
transferred the doves to the upturned soles of her feet, now the
highest part of the contorted ball she had knotted herself into.
The onlookers gasped and applauded, but the sight made Nynaeve
shiver. It was all too good a reminder of what Moghedien had done
to her.</p>

<p><em>That isn&rsquo;t why I mean to hand her over to the
Blues</em>, she told herself. <em>I just do not want to cause
calamity again</em>. That was true, but she was also afraid that
the next time, she would not escape so easily or so lightly. She
would not have admitted that to another soul. She did not like
admitting it to herself.</p>

<p>Giving the contortionist one last puzzled glance&mdash;she could not begin to puzzle out what the woman had twisted
herself into now&mdash;she turned away. And started as Elayne and
Birgitte suddenly appeared at her side out of the milling crowd.
Elayne had a cloak decently covering her white coat and breeches;
Birgitte was all but flaunting her low-necked red gown. No, there
was no &ldquo;all but&rdquo; to it. She stood even straighter than usual and
had tossed back her braid to remove even its minimal covering.
Nynaeve fingered the knot of her shawl at her waist, wishing every
glance at Birgitte did not remind her how much she herself would be
showing once the gray wool came off. The other woman&rsquo;s quiver hung
at her belt, and she carried the bow Luca had found for her. Surely
the day was too late for her to go through with the shooting.</p>

<p>A glance at the sky told Nynaeve she was wrong.
Despite everything that had happened, the sun still stood well
above the horizon. Shadows stretched long, but not long enough to
dissuade Birgitte, she suspected.</p>

<p>In an attempt to cover checking the sun, she nodded
toward the woman in the gauzy trousers, who had now begun to twist
herself into something that Nynaeve knew was impossible. While
still balancing on her teeth. &ldquo;Where did she come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luca hired her,&rdquo; Birgitte answered calmly. &ldquo;He
bought some leopards, as well. Her name is Muelin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Birgitte was all self-possessed coolness, Elayne
very nearly quivered with emotion. &ldquo;Where did she <em>come</em>
from?&rdquo; she spluttered. &ldquo;She came from a show that a mob nearly
destroyed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard about that,&rdquo; Nynaeve said, &ldquo;but that isn&rsquo;t
what is important. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not important!&rdquo; Elayne rolled her eyes to the
heavens as if for guidance. &ldquo;Did you also hear <em>why</em>? I
don&rsquo;t know whether it was Whitecloaks or this Prophet, but somebody
whipped up that mob because they thought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She glanced around
without slowing and lowered her voice; none of the crowd had
stopped, but every passerby stared at two obvious performers
standing. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that a woman in the show might wear a shawl.&rdquo; She
emphasized the last word significantly. &ldquo;Fools to think she&rsquo;d be
with a traveling menagerie, but then, you and I are. And you go
dashing into the city without a word to anyone. We&rsquo;ve heard
everything from a baldheaded man carrying you off over his shoulder
to you kissing a Shienaran and traipsing away with him arm in
arm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve was still gaping when Birgitte added, &ldquo;Luca
was upset, whatever the tale. He said&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She cleared her throat
and made her voice deep. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;So she likes rough men, does she? Well,
I can be as rough as a winter cob!&rsquo; And off he set, leading two
lads with shoulders like s&rsquo;Gandin quarrymen, to fetch you back.
Thom Merrilin and Juilin Sandar went as well, in not much better
temper. That did not improve Luca&rsquo;s, but they were all so upset
over you it left no room for anger at each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Nynaeve stared in confusion. She liked
rough men? What could he possibly mean by&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Slowly it sank in,
and she groaned. &ldquo;Oh, that is just what I need.&rdquo; And Thom and
Juilin running around Samara. The Light knew what trouble they
could get into.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I still want to know what you thought you were
doing,&rdquo; Elayne said, &ldquo;but we are wasting time here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve let them start her off through the crowd, one
to either side, but even with the news of Luca and the others, she
felt satisfied with her day&rsquo;s work. &ldquo;We should be out of here in a
day or two, with luck. If Galad doesn&rsquo;t find us a boat, Masema
will. It turns out he is the Prophet. You remember Masema, Elayne.
That sour-faced Shienaran we saw&mdash;&rdquo; Realizing that Elayne had
stopped, Nynaeve paused for her to catch up again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Galad?&rdquo; the younger woman said disbelievingly,
forgetting to hold her cloak closed. &ldquo;You saw&mdash;you
<em>spoke</em> to Galad? <em>And</em> the Prophet? You must have,
or how would they be trying to find a vessel? Did you have tea with
them, or did you just meet them in a common room? Where the
bald-headed man carried you, no doubt. Maybe the King of Ghealdan
was there, too? Would you please convince me I am dreaming so I can
wake up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get a grip on yourself,&rdquo; Nynaeve said firmly. &ldquo;It is
a queen, now, not a king, and yes, she was. And he wasn&rsquo;t bald; he
had a topknot. The Shienaran, I mean. Not the Prophet.
<em>He&rsquo;s</em> as bald as&mdash;&rdquo; She glared at Birgitte until the
woman stopped snickering. The glower slipped a little when Nynaeve
remembered who she was glowering at and what she had done to her,
but if the woman had not smoothed her features, they might have
found out whether she could bring herself to slap Birgitte
cross-eyed. They began walking again, and she said as levelly as
she could manage, &ldquo;This is what happened. I saw Uno, one of the
Shienarans who was at Falme, watching you highwalk, Elayne. He
doesn&rsquo;t think any better of the Daughter-Heir of Andor showing her
legs than I do, by the way. In any case, Moiraine sent them here
after Falme, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She related everything quickly as they made their way
through the crowd, riding roughshod over Elayne&rsquo;s increasingly
incredulous exclamations, answering their questions in as few words
as possible. Despite a quick interest in the shifts of the
Ghealdanin throne, Elayne concentrated on <em>exactly</em> what
Galad had said and why Nynaeve had been fool enough to approach the
Prophet, whoever he was. That word&mdash;<em>fool</em>&mdash;popped up often enough to make Nynaeve keep a tight leash on her
temper. She might doubt whether she could slap Birgitte, but Elayne
had no such protection, Daughter-Heir or not. A few more
repetitions, and the girl would discover it. Birgitte was more
interested in Masema&rsquo;s intentions on the one hand and the
Shienarans on the other. It seemed she had encountered
Borderlanders in previous lives, though their nations had had
different names, and thought well of them by and large. She said
little, really, but she appeared to approve of holding on to the
Shienarans.</p>

<p>Nynaeve expected the news about Salidar to startle
them, or excite them, or anything but what it did. Birgitte took it
as matter-of-factly as if she had said they would eat supper with
Thom and Juilin that night. Plainly she meant to go where Elayne
did, and all else mattered little. Elayne looked doubtful.
Doubtful!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you certain? You have tried so hard to remember,
and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Well, it seems awfully fortuitous that Galad should just
happen to mention it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve glowered. &ldquo;Of course I am certain.
Coincidences <em>do</em> happen. The Wheel weaves as the Wheel
wills, as you may have heard. I remember now that he mentioned it
in Sienda, too, but I was so concerned over <em>you</em> being
concerned about him that I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; She cut off short.</p>

<p>They had arrived at a long narrow area near the north
wall, marked off by ropes. At one end stood something like a
segment of wooden fence, two paces wide and two tall. People lined
the ropes four deep, with children crouching down in front or
holding a father&rsquo;s leg or a mother&rsquo;s skirts. A buzz rose as the
three women appeared. Nynaeve would have stopped dead, but Birgitte
had her by the arm, and it was walk or be dragged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought we were going to the wagon,&rdquo; she said
faintly. Busy with talking, she had paid too little attention to
where they were going.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not unless you want to see me shoot in the dark,&rdquo;
Birgitte replied. She sounded all too willing to give it a try.</p>

<p>Nynaeve wished she could have made some other comment
than a squeak. The bit of fence filled her vision as they
progressed down the open space, to the exclusion of the onlookers.
Even their increasing murmurs sounded distant. The fence looked a
mile from where Birgitte would stand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure that he said he swore by&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;our
mother?&rdquo; Elayne demanded sourly. Acknowledging Galad as her brother
even that far was unpleasant for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Yes. I said so, didn&rsquo;t I? Listen. If Luca is
in the city, he would not know whether we did this or not until it
was too late to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Nynaeve knew she was babbling, but she could
not seem to stop her tongue. Somehow she had never realized how
<em>far</em> a hundred paces really was. In the Two Rivers, grown
men always shot targets at twice that. But then, none of those
targets had ever been <em>her</em>. &ldquo;I mean, it already is very
late. The shadows&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The glare&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;We really should do this in
the morning. When the light is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he swore by her,&rdquo; Elayne broke in as if she had
not been listening, &ldquo;then he will hold to it no matter what. He
would sooner break an oath on his hope of salvation and rebirth
than that. I think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;no, I <em>know</em> we can trust him.&rdquo; She
did not sound as if she particularly liked it, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The light is just fine,&rdquo; Birgitte said, a hint of
amusement in her calm voice. &ldquo;I might try it blindfolded. This lot
will want it to look difficult, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve opened her mouth, but nothing came out. This
time she would have settled for a squeak. Birgitte was only making
a bad joke. She had to be joking.</p>

<p>They positioned her with her back against the rough
wooden fence, and Elayne began tugging at the knot in the shawl as
Birgitte turned back the way they had come, drawing an arrow from
her quiver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You really did something foolish this time,&rdquo; Elayne
muttered. &ldquo;We can trust Galad&rsquo;s oath, I&rsquo;m sure, but you could not
know what he might do beforehand. And to approach the Prophet!&rdquo; She
jerked the shawl from Nynaeve&rsquo;s shoulders roughly. &ldquo;You could have
had <em>no</em> idea whatsoever what <em>he</em> might do. You
worried everybody and risked everything!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Nynaeve managed to get out. The sun was in
her eyes; she could no longer see Birgitte at all. But Birgitte
could see her. Of course she could. That was the important
thing.</p>

<p>Elayne looked at her suspiciously. &ldquo;You know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I risked everything. I should have talked
with you, asked you. I know I&rsquo;ve been a fool. I should not be
allowed outside without a keeper.&rdquo; It all came in a breathless
rush. Birgitte <em>must</em> be able to see her.</p>

<p>Suspicion became concern. &ldquo;Are you all right? If you
really do not want to do this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman thought she was afraid. Nynaeve could not,
would not, allow that. She forced a smile, hoped her eyes were not
too wide. Her face felt tight. &ldquo;Of course I want to. I&rsquo;m looking
forward to it, actually.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne gave her a dubious frown, but nodded at last.
&ldquo;You are <em>sure</em> about Salidar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not wait for an answer, but hurried off to
one side, folding the shawl. For some reason, Nynaeve could not
work up a proper indignation over the question, or Elayne not
waiting. Her breath was coming so fast that she was dimly aware
that she might come right out of the dress&rsquo;s low neck, yet even
that thought could not catch her. The sun filled her view; had she
squinted, she might have been able to make out Birgitte after a
fashion, but her eyes had a will of their own, increasingly
widening.</p>

<p>There was nothing she could do now. It was a
punishment for taking foolish risks. She could manage only the
tiniest pique over being punished after working everything out so
well. And Elayne did not even believe her about Salidar! She would
have to take it stoically. She would&mdash;</p>

<p>Seemingly out of nowhere an arrow <em>tchunked</em>
into the wood, vibrating against her right wrist, and stoic resolve
broke with a low wail. It was all she could do to keep her knees
straight. A second arrow brushed the other wrist, producing a
slightly higher pitch to her yelp. She could as soon stop
Birgitte&rsquo;s shafts as silence herself. Arrow by arrow the yelps rose
higher, and it seemed to her almost as if the crowd was cheering
her cries. The louder she shrieked, the louder they cheered and
applauded. By the time she was outlined from knees to head, the
applause was thunderous. In truth, she felt some irritation at the
finish, when the crowd all rushed to throng around Birgitte,
leaving her standing there staring at the fletchings around her.
Some still quivered. <em>She</em> still quivered.</p>

<p>Pushing away, she scurried off toward the wagons as
quickly as she could before anyone noticed how much her legs were
wobbling. Not that anyone was paying any attention to <em>her</em>.
All she had done was stand there and pray Birgitte did not sneeze,
or get an itch. And tomorrow she would have to go through it again.
That or let Elayne&mdash;and worse, Birgitte&mdash;know she could
not face it.</p>

<p>When Uno came that night asking after Nana, she told
him in no uncertain terms to prod Masema as much as he dared and to
find Galad and tell him he <em>must</em> find a boat quickly,
whatever it required. Then she took to her bed without eating and
tried to make herself believe that she could convince Elayne and
Birgitte that she was too ill to stand against that wall. Only, she
was all too certain they would know exactly what her illness was.
That even Birgitte would likely be all sympathy just made it worse.
One of those fool men <em>had</em> to find a riverboat!</p>
