<h4><em>The Craft of Kin Tovere</em></h4>

hand on his sword hilt, the other holding the
green-and-white tasseled length of Seanchan spear, Rand ignored the
others on the sparsely treed hilltop for the moment while he
studied the three camps spread out below in the midmorning sun.
Three distinct camps, and that was the rub. They were all the
Cairhienin and Tairen forces at his disposal. Every man else who
could use sword or spear was penned in the city, or the Light alone
knew where.</p>

<p>The Aiel had rounded up refugees in hordes between
the Jangai Pass and here, and a few had even straggled in on their
own, lured by rumors that <em>these</em> Aiel at least were not
killing everyone in sight, or else too dispirited to care so long
as they had a meal before dying. Too many thought they would die,
at the hands of the Aiel or the Dragon Reborn, or in the Last
Battle, which they seemed to think was shaping up for any day now.
A goodly number all together, but farmers and craftsmen and
shopkeepers for the most part. Some knew how to use bow or sling to
fetch a rabbit, but there was not a soldier in the lot and no time
to teach them. The city of Cairhien itself lay little more than
five miles to the west, some of the fabled &ldquo;topless towers of
Cairhien&rdquo; visible above the intervening forest. The city sprawled
across hills hard by the River Alguenya, encircled by Couladin&rsquo;s
Shaido and those who had joined him.</p>

<p>One haphazard set of tents and cook-fires in the long
shallow valley below Rand held some eight hundred Tairens, armored
men. Nearly half were Defenders of the Stone in burnished
breastplates and rimmed helmets, their plump coatsleeves striped
black and gold. The rest were levies from a double handful of lords
whose banners and pennants made a circle in the camp&rsquo;s center
around the silver Crescent-and-Stars of the High Lord Weiramon.
Guards stood thickly along their picket lines as if they expected a
raid against the horses any minute.</p>

<p>Three hundred paces away, the second camp guarded
their horses as tightly. The animals were a mixed lot, few
approaching the fine arch-necked stock of Tear, and some former
plow and cart horses were tied along those ropes or Rand missed his
guess. The Cairhienin numbered perhaps a hundred more than the
Tairens, but their tents were fewer and most often patched, and
their banners and <em>con</em> represented some seventy-odd lords.
Few Cairhienin nobles still had many retainers, and the army had
broken apart early in the civil war.</p>

<p>The last gathering lay another five hundred paces
along, full of Cairhienin for the most part, yet well and truly
separated from the others by more than distance. Larger than the
other pair combined, this camp held few tents or horses. It
displayed no banners, and only the officers wore <em>con</em>, the
small pennants on their backs in solid colors meant to pick them
out for their men rather than signify a House. Infantry might be
necessary, but rare was the lord of Tear or Cairhien, either one,
who would admit it. Certainly none would agree to actually lead
such. It was the most orderly of the camps, though, the cookfires
in neat rows, the long pikes stacked upright where they could be
seized in a moment and clusters of archers or crossbowmen dotted
along the lines. According to Lan, discipline kept men alive in
battle, but infantry were more likely to know it and believe than
cavalry.</p>

<p>The three groups were supposedly together, under the
same command&mdash;the High Lord Weiramon had brought them in from
the south late the day before&mdash;but the two camps of horsemen
watched each other nearly as warily as they did the Aiel on the
surrounding hills, the Tairens with a dose of contempt that the
Cairhienin echoed in ignoring the third, which in turn eyed the
others sullenly. Rand&rsquo;s followers, his allies, and as ready to
fight each other as anyone else.</p>

<p>Still pretending to study the camps, Rand examined
Weiramon, helmetless and iron-spined straight nearby. Two younger
men, minor Tairen lords, hung at the High Lord&rsquo;s heels, dark beards
trimmed and oiled in perfect imitation of Weiramon&rsquo;s except that
his was streaked with gray, and their breastplates, worn over
brightly striped coats, bore gold-work only a touch less ornate
than his. Aloof, apart from everyone else on the hilltop yet close
to Rand, they could have been waiting for some martial ceremony at
a royal court, except for the sweat rolling down their faces. They
ignored that as well, though.</p>

<p>The High Lord&rsquo;s sigil lacked only a few stars to
duplicate Lanfear&rsquo;s, but the long-nosed fellow was not her in
disguise, with his mainly gray hair oiled like his beard and combed
in a vain attempt to hide its thinness. He had been coming north
with reinforcements from Tear when he heard that Aiel were
attacking the city of Cairhien itself. Instead of turning back or
sitting still, he continued north as hard as his horses could
stand, gathering what forces he found along the way.</p>

<p>That was the good news of Weiramon. The bad was that
he had fully expected to dispel the Shaido around Cairhien with
what he had brought. He still did. And he was none too happy that
Rand would not let him be about it or that he was surrounded by
Aiel. One Aiel was no different from another to Weiramon. To the
others, too, for that matter. One of the young lords pointedly
sniffed a scented silk handkerchief whenever he looked at an Aiel.
Rand wondered how long the fellow would survive. And what Rand
would have to do about it when he died.</p>

<p>Weiramon noticed Rand watching, and cleared his
throat. &ldquo;My Lord Dragon,&rdquo; he began in a gravelly bark, &ldquo;one good
charge will scatter them like quail.&rdquo; He slapped his gauntlets
against his palm loudly. &ldquo;Foot never stands up to horse. I will
send in the Cairhienin to flush them, then follow with my&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand cut him off. Could the man count at all? Did the
number of Aiel he could see here give him no clue to how many might
be around the city? It did not matter. Rand had heard as much of
this as he could stomach. &ldquo;You are certain of the news you bring
from Tear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Weiramon blinked. &ldquo;News, my Lord Dragon? What&mdash;?
Oh, that. Burn my soul, there&rsquo;s nothing to that. Illianer pirates
often try to raid along the coast.&rdquo; They were more than trying, by
what the man had said when he arrived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the attacks on the Plains of Maredo? Do they
often do that, as well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, burn my soul, those are just brigands.&rdquo; It was
more statement of fact than protest. &ldquo;Perhaps not Illianers at all,
but certainly not soldiers. The jumble those Illianers make of
things, who can say whether king or Assemblage or Council of Nine
has the whip-hand on any given day, yet if they do decide to move,
it will be armies striking at Tear under the Golden Bees, not
raiders burning merchants wagons and border farms. You can mark me
on that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you wish it,&rdquo; Rand replied, as politely as he
could. Whatever power the Assemblage, or the Council of Nine, or
Mattin Stepaneos den Balgar had, it was what Sammael chose to leave
them. But relatively few knew that the Forsaken were loose already.
Some who should know refused to believe, or ignored it&mdash;as if
that would make the Forsaken go away&mdash;or seemed to think that
if it had to happen, it would be in some vague and preferably
distant future. There was no point in trying to convince Weiramon,
whichever group he belonged in. The man&rsquo;s belief or disbelief
changed nothing.</p>

<p>The High Lord scowled at the hollow between the
hills. More specifically, at the two Cairhienin camps. &ldquo;With no
proper rule here as yet, who can say what riffraff have drifted
south?&rdquo; Grimacing, he slapped his gauntlets even harder before
turning back to Rand. &ldquo;Well, we will bring them to heel soon enough
for you, my Lord Dragon. If you will only give the order, I can
drive&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand brushed past him, not listening, though Weiramon
followed, still asking authority to attack, the other two trailing
him like heel-hounds. The man was a stone-blind fool.</p>

<p>They were not alone, of course. The hilltop was
crowded, really. Sulin had a hundred <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>
arrayed around the peak, for one thing, every last one looking even
more ready to don her veil than Aiel usually did. It was not only
the nearness of the Shaido that had Sulin on edge. In mockery of
Rand&rsquo;s contempt for the suspicions in the camps below, Enaila and
two Maidens were never far from Weiramon and his lordlings, and the
closer they stood to Rand, the more the three Maidens looked about
to don veils.</p>

<p>Not far off, Aviendha stood talking with a dozen or
more Wise Ones, shawls looped over their elbows, all but she decked
in bracelets and necklaces. Surprisingly, it was a bony
white-haired woman, even older than Bair, who seemed to be taking
the lead. Rand would have expected Amys or Bair, but even they shut
up as soon as Sorilea spoke. Melaine was with Bael, halfway between
the other Wise Ones and the other clan chiefs. She kept adjusting
the coat of Bael&rsquo;s <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em> as if he did not know how to
dress himself, and he had the patient look of a man reminding
himself of all the reasons he had married. It might be personal,
but Rand suspected the Wise Ones were trying to influence the
chiefs again. If that was the case, he would learn the particulars
soon enough.</p>

<p>It was Aviendha who held Rand&rsquo;s eye, though. She
smiled at him briefly before returning to listening to Sorilea. A
friendly smile, but no more. That was something, he supposed. She
had not lashed out at him once since what had happened between
them, and if she sometimes made an acid comment it was no sharper
than what he might have expected from Egwene. Except the one time
he had brought up marriage again; then she had scorched his ears so
thoroughly that he had left it alone thereafter. But friendly was
as far as it went, though she was sometimes careless now about
undressing in front of him at night. She still insisted on sleeping
no more than three paces from him.</p>

<p>The Maidens, at any rate, seemed sure that there was
a lot less than three paces between their blankets, and he kept
expecting that certainty to spread, but so far it had not. Egwene
would come down on him like a falling tree if she even <em>
suspected</em> something like that. It was easy enough for her to
talk of Elayne, but he could not even puzzle out Aviendha, and she
was right there in front of him. All in all, he was tenser than
ever when he as much as looked at Aviendha, but she seemed more
relaxed than he had ever seen her. Somehow or other, that seemed
the opposite of how it should be. It all seemed topsy-turvy with
her. But then, Min was the only woman who had <em>not</em> made him
feel as if he were standing on his head half the time.</p>

<p>Sighing, he walked on, still not listening to
Weiramon. One day he was going to understand women. When he had the
time to apply to it. He suspected a lifetime would not be enough,
though.</p>

<p>The clan chiefs had their own gathering, of sept
chiefs and representatives from the societies. Rand recognized some
of them. Dark Heirn, chief of the Jindo Taardad, and Mangin, who
gave him a companionable nod and the Tairens a contemptuous
grimace. Spear-slender Juranai, leader of <em>Aethan Dor</em>, the
Red Shields, on this expedition despite a few streaks of white in
his pale brown hair, and Roidan, thick-shouldered and gray, who led
<em>Sha&rsquo;mad Conde</em>, the Thunder Walkers. Those four had
sometimes joined him in practicing the Aiel way of fighting without
weapons since leaving the Jangai Pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want to go hunting today?&rdquo; Mangin asked as
Rand passed, and Rand looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hunting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is not much to give sport, but we could try
catching sheep in a sack.&rdquo; The wry glance Mangin darted at the
Tairens left little doubt what &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; he meant, though Weiramon
and the others did not see. Or affected not to. The lordling with
the perfumed handkerchief sniffed it again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another time, maybe,&rdquo; Rand replied, shaking his
head. He thought he could have been friends with any of the four,
but especially Mangin, who had a sense of humor much like Mat&rsquo;s. If
he had no time to study women, he certainly had no time for making
new friends. Little time for old friends, for that matter. Mat
worried him.</p>

<p>On the highest part of the hill, a heavy framework
tower of logs thrust above the treetops, the wide platform at the
top twenty spans or more above the ground. The Aiel knew nothing
about working with wood on that scale, but there had been plenty
among the Cairhienin refugees who did.</p>

<p>Moiraine was waiting at the base of the first
slanting ladder with Lan, and Egwene. Egwene had been getting a
good bit of sun; she really could have passed for Aiel except for
her dark eyes. A short Aiel. He scanned her face quickly, but
detected nothing except tiredness. Amys and the others must be
working her too hard with her training. She would not thank him for
interceding, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you decided?&rdquo; Rand asked, stopping. Weiramon
fell silent at last.</p>

<p>Egwene hesitated, but Rand noted that she did not
look at Moiraine before nodding. &ldquo;I will do what I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her reluctance bothered him. He had not asked
Moiraine&mdash;she could not use the One Power as a weapon against
the Shaido, not unless they threatened her or he managed to
convince her they were all Darkfriends&mdash;but Egwene had not
taken the Three Oaths, and he had been sure she would see the
necessity. Instead, she had gone white-faced when he suggested it
and had avoided him for three days until now. At least she had
agreed. Whatever made the fight shorter against the Shaido must be
for the good.</p>

<p>Moiraine&rsquo;s face never changed, though he had no doubt
what she thought. Those smooth Aes Sedai features, those Aes Sedai
eyes, could register icy disapproval without altering a jot.</p>

<p>Thrusting the piece of spear through his belt, he put
foot to the first rung&mdash;and Moiraine spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you wearing a sword again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last question he would have expected. &ldquo;Why
shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he muttered, and scrambled upward. Not a good answer,
but she had caught him off balance.</p>

<p>The half-healed wound in his side tugged as he
climbed, not quite hurting but seeming about to break open just the
same. He paid it no mind; it often felt that way when he exerted
himself.</p>

<p>Rhuarc and the other clan chiefs came after him, Bael
leaving Melaine last of all, but thankfully Weiramon and his two
toadies remained on the ground. The High Lord <em>knew</em> what
was to be done; he needed and wanted no more information. Feeling
Moiraine&rsquo;s eyes following him, Rand glanced down. Not Moiraine. It
was Egwene watching him climb, her face so close to Aes Sedai that
he could not have slid a hair through the difference. Moiraine had
her head together with Lan&rsquo;s. He hoped Egwene was not going to
change her mind.</p>

<p>On the broad platform at the top, two short, sweating
young men in shirtsleeves were setting a brass-bound wooden tube,
three paces long and bigger around than either&rsquo;s arm, on a pivoting
frame fastened to the railing. An identical tube already sat a few
paces away, where it had been almost since the tower was completed
the day before. A third coatless man wiped his bald head with a
striped kerchief while he growled at them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy with it. <em>Easy</em>, I said! You motherless
weasels knock a lens out of alignment, and I will knock your
brainless heads backward to front. Fasten it. Tight, Jol. Tight! If
it falls while the Lord Dragon is looking through it, you both had
better jump after it. Not just for him. You break my work and you
will wish you had broken your fool skulls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jol and the other fellow, Cail, worked on, quickly
but not very visibly perturbed. They had had years to grow used to
Kin Tovere&rsquo;s way of talking. It had been finding a craftsman who
made lenses and looking glasses&mdash;and his two apprentices&mdash;among the refugees that had first given Rand the idea for
this tower.</p>

<p>At first none of the three noticed they were not
alone. The clan chiefs climbed on silent feet, and Tovere&rsquo;s
harangue was enough to cover the sound of Rand&rsquo;s boots. Rand
himself was startled when Lan&rsquo;s head popped through the open trap
after Bael; boots or no, the Warder made no more noise than the
Aiel. Even Lan stood a head taller than the Cairhienin.</p>

<p>When they finally did see the new arrivals, the two
apprentices gave wide-eyed starts as if they had never seen an Aiel
before, then bent themselves in half bowing to Rand and stayed that
way. The lensmaker jerked almost as much at the sight of the Aiel,
but made a more restrained bow, wiping his head again in the middle
of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Told you I would have the second finished today, my
Lord Dragon.&rdquo; Tovere managed to get respect into his tone without
making his voice one bit less gruff. &ldquo;A wonderful thought, this
tower. I would never have conceived it, but once you started asking
how far you could see with a looking glass&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Give me time, and
I will make you one to see Caemlyn from here. If the tower is built
high enough,&rdquo; he added judiciously. &ldquo;There are limits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you&rsquo;ve done already is more than enough, Master
Tovere.&rdquo; More than Rand had hoped for, certainly. He had already
had a look through the first looking glass.</p>

<p>Jol and Cail were still bent at right angles, heads
down. &ldquo;Perhaps you had best take your apprentices below,&rdquo; Rand
said. &ldquo;So we don&rsquo;t get crowded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was room for four times as many, but Tovere
immediately poked Cail&rsquo;s shoulder with a thick finger. &ldquo;Come along,
you ham-fisted stableboys. We are in the Lord Dragon&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The apprentices barely straightened enough to follow
him, gazing round-eyed at Rand even more than at the Aiel as they
vanished down the ladder. Cail was a year older than he, Jol two.
Both had been born in bigger towns than he had imagined before
leaving the Two Rivers, had visited Cairhien and seen the king and
the Amyrlin Seat, if at a distance, while he was still tending
sheep. Very likely, they still knew more of the world than he in
some ways. Shaking his head, he bent to the new looking glass.</p>

<p>Cairhien leaped into view. The forests, never
particularly thick to one used to Two Rivers&rsquo; woods, stopped
completely well short of the city, of course. High gray
square-towered walls in a perfect square against the river mocked
the hills&rsquo; flowing curves. Within, more towers rose in precise
pattern, marking the points of a grid, some twenty times as high as
the walls or more, yet all surrounded by scaffolding. The legendary
topless towers were still being rebuilt after their burning in the
Aiel War.</p>

<p>When last he had seen the city, another city had
surrounded it from riverbank to riverbank&mdash;Foregate, a rabbit
warren as raucous as Cairhien was solemn, all in wood. Now only a
wide stretch of ash and charred timbers bordered the walls. How
that fire had been kept from spreading into Cairhien itself, he
could not understand.</p>

<p>Banners decked every tower in the city, too distant
to make out clearly, but scouts had described them to him. Half
bore the Crescents of Tear; the other half, perhaps not
surprisingly, duplicated the Dragon banner he had left flying over
the Stone of Tear. Not one bore the Rising Sun of Cairhien.</p>

<p>Moving the looking glass only a little swept the city
from his sight. On the far side of the river still stood the
blackened stone shells of the granaries. Some of the Cairhienin
Rand had talked to claimed the torching of the granaries had led to
riots and then King Galldrian&rsquo;s death, and thus to the civil war.
Others said Galldrian&rsquo;s assassination had caused the riots and the
burning. Rand doubted that he would ever know which was the truth,
or whether either was.</p>

<p>A number of burned-out hulks dotted both banks of the
wide river, but none lay close to the city. Aiel had an uneasiness&mdash;fear might be too strong a word&mdash;about bodies of water
they could not step across or wade, but Couladin had managed to put
barriers of floating logs across the Alguenya both above and below
Cairhien, along with enough men to see they were not cut.
Fire-arrows had done the rest. Nothing except rats and birds could
get into or out of Cairhien without Couladin&rsquo;s leave.</p>

<p>The hills around the city showed little sign of a
besieging army. Here and there vultures flapped heavily, no doubt
feasting on the remains of some attempt to break out, but no Shaido
were visible. Aiel seldom were unless they wanted to be.</p>

<p>Wait. Rand swung the looking glass back to a treeless
hilltop perhaps a mile from the city walls. Back to a cluster of
men. He could not discern faces, or much else aside from the fact
that they all wore the <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em>. One thing more. One of
those men had bare arms. Couladin. Rand was sure it must be
imagination, but he thought that when Couladin moved he could see
sunlight glittering off the metallic scales encircling the man&rsquo;s
forearms in imitation of his own. Asmodean had put those there.
Just an attempt to divert Rand&rsquo;s attention, to occupy him while
Asmodean worked his own plans, but without that, how much would
have turned out differently? Certainly, he would not be standing on
this tower, watching a besieged city and awaiting a battle.</p>

<p>Suddenly, something streaked through the air on that
distant hilltop, a long blur, and two of the men there went down
thrashing. Staring at the fallen men, both apparently transfixed
with the same spear, Couladin and the others seemed as stunned as
Rand. Twisting the looking glass, Rand scanned for the man who had
thrown with such force. He had to be brave&mdash;and a fool&mdash;to get close enough. Rand&rsquo;s search widened quickly, beyond any
possible range of a human arm. He was beginning to think of Ogier&mdash;not likely; it took a great deal to rouse an Ogier into
violence&mdash;when another streaking blur caught his eye.</p>

<p>Startled, he half-straightened before jerking the
glass back to Cairhien&rsquo;s walls. That spear&mdash;or whatever it
was&mdash;had come from there. He was certain of it. How was
another matter entirely. At this distance it was all he could do to
make out an occasional someone moving on the walls or atop a
tower.</p>

<p>Raising his head, Rand found Rhuarc just stepping
away from the other looking glass, giving up his place to Han. That
was the whole reason for the tower and the glasses. Scouts brought
back what word they could of how the Shaido were deployed, but this
way the chiefs could see for themselves the terrain on which the
battle would be fought. They had worked out a plan between them
already, but one more look at the land could never go amiss. Rand
did not know much about battles, but Lan thought their plan a good
one. At least, Rand did not know much in his own mind; sometimes
those other memories crept in, and then he seemed to know more than
he wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see that? Those&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;spears?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhuarc looked as puzzled as Rand knew he himself
must, but the Aiel nodded. &ldquo;The last took another Shaido, but he
crawled away. Not Couladin, worse luck.&rdquo; He gestured to the looking
glass, and Rand let him take his place.</p>

<p>Was it such bad luck? Couladin&rsquo;s death would not end
the threat to Cairhien, or to anywhere else. Now they were this
side of the Dragonwall, the Shaido would not tamely return just
because the man they thought was the true <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> died.
It might well shake them, but not enough for that. And after all
Rand had seen, he did not think Couladin deserved so easy a way
out. <em>I can be as hard as I must</em>, he thought, stroking his
sword hilt. <em>For him, I can</em>.</p>
