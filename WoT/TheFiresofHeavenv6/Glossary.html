<p class="drop"><em>A NOTE ON DATES IN THIS GLOSSARY.</em> Three systems
of recording dates have been in general use since the Breaking of
the World. The first recorded years After the Breaking (AB). Since
the years of the Breaking and immediately after were years of
almost total chaos, and since this calendar was adopted a good
hundred years after the end of the Breaking, its starting point was
arbitrarily assigned. At the end of the Trolloc Wars many records
had been lost, so much so that there was argument about the exact
year under the old system. A new calendar was therefore
established, dating from the end of the Wars and celebrating the
supposed freedom of the world from the Trolloc threat. This second
calendar recorded each year as Free Year (FY). After the
disruption, death, and destruction caused by the War of the Hundred
Years, a third calendar came into being. This calendar, of the New
Era (NE), is currently in use.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Accepted</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Young women in training to be Aes Sedai who have reached a
certain level of power and passed certain tests. It normally takes
five to ten years to be raised from novice to the Accepted.
Accepted are somewhat less confined by rules than novices, and are
allowed to choose their own areas of study, within limits. An
Accepted has the right to wear a Great Serpent ring, but only on
the third finger of her left hand. When an Accepted is raised to
the Aes Sedai, she chooses her Ajah, gains the right to wear the
shawl, and may wear the ring on any finger or not at all as
circumstances warrant.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>a&rsquo;dam</em></strong> (<strong>AYE-dam</strong>):</dt>

<dd>A Seanchan device for controlling a woman who can channel,
consisting of a collar and a bracelet linked by a leash all of
silvery metal control. It has no effect on a woman who cannot
channel. <em>See also</em> <em>damane</em>; Seanchan;
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em>.</dd>

<dt><strong>Aes Sedai</strong> (<strong>EYEZ
seh-DEYE</strong>):</dt>

<dd>Wielders of the One Power. Since the Time of Madness, all
surviving Aes Sedai are women. Widely distrusted and feared, even
hated, they are blamed by many for the Breaking of the World, and
are thought to meddle in the affairs of nations. At the same time,
few rulers will be without an Aes Sedai adviser, even in lands
where the existence of such a connection must be kept secret. After
some years of channeling the One Power, Aes Sedai take on an
ageless quality, so that an Aes Sedai who is old enough to be a
grandmother may show no signs of age except perhaps a few gray
hairs. <em>See also</em> Ajah; Amyrlin Seat; Time of Madness.</dd>

<dt><strong>Age of Legends</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The Age ended by the War of the Shadow and the Breaking of the
World. A time when Aes Sedai performed wonders now only dreamed of.
<em>See also</em> Wheel of Time; Breaking of the World; War of the
Shadow.</dd>

<dt><strong>Aiel</strong> (<strong>eye-EEL</strong>):</dt>

<dd>The people of the Aiel Waste. Fierce and hardy. Also called
Aielmen. They veil their faces before they kill. Deadly warriors with weapons or with nothing but
their bare hands, they will not touch a sword. Their pipers play
them into battle with the music of dances, and Aielmen call battle
&ldquo;the dance,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the dance of spears.&rdquo; They are divided into twelve clans: the Chareen, the Codarra, the Daryne, the Goshien, the Miagoma, the Nakai, the Reyn, the Shaarad, the Shaido, the Shiande, the Taardad, and the Tomanelle. Sometimes they speak of a thirteenth clan, the Clan That Is Not, the Jenn, who were the builders of Rhuidean. <em>See also</em> Aiel
warrior societies; Aiel Waste; Rhuidean.</dd>

<dt><strong>Aiel kinship terms</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Aiel relationships of blood are expressed in complex ways which outsiders consider unwieldy, but which Aiel consider precise. A few examples must suffice to demonstrate, as an entire volume would be needed for a full explanation. First-brother and first-sister have the same mother. Second-brother and second-sister refer to the children of one&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s first-sister or first-brother, and sister-mothers and sister-fathers are first-sisters and first-brothers of one&rsquo;s mother. Greatfather or greatmother refers to the father or mother of one&rsquo;s own mother, while the parents of one&rsquo;s father are second greatfather or second greatmother; one is closer blood kin to one&rsquo;s mother than father. Beyond this the complications grow and are thickened by such factors as the ability of close friends to adopt each other as first-brother or first-sister. When it is also considered that Aiel women who are close friends sometimes marry the same man, thus becoming sister-wives and married to each other as well as to him, the convolutions become even more apparent.</dd>

<dt><strong>Aiel War, the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>(976-978 NE) When King Laman of Cairhien cut down
<em>Avendoraldera</em>, several clans of the Aiel crossed the Spine
of the World. They looted and burned the capital city of Cairhien
as well as many other cities and towns, and the conflict extended
into Andor and Tear. The conventional view is that the Aiel were
finally defeated at the Battle of the Shining Walls, before Tar
Valon, but in fact, Laman was killed in that battle, and having
done what they came for, the Aiel recrossed the Spine. <em>See
also</em> <em>Avendoraldera</em>; Cairhien; Spine of the World.</dd>

<dt><strong>Aiel warrior societies</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Aiel warriors are all members of one of twelve societies. These are Black Eyes (<em>Seia Doon</em>), Brothers of the Eagle (<em>Far Aldazar Din</em>), Dawn Runners (<em>Rahien Sorien</em>), Knife Hands (<em>Sovin Nai</em>), Maidens of the Spear (<em>Far Dareis Mai</em>), Mountain Dancers (<em>Hama N&rsquo;dore</em>), Night Spears (<em>Cor Darei</em>), Red Shields
(<em>Aethan Dor</em>), Stone Dogs (<em>Shae&rsquo;en M&rsquo;taal</em>), Thunder Walkers (<em>Sha&rsquo;mad Conde</em>), True Bloods (<em>Tain Shari</em>), and Water Seekers (<em>Duahde Mahdi&rsquo;in</em>). Each society
has its own customs, and sometimes specific duties. For example,
Red Shields act as police. Stone Dogs are often used as rear guards
during retreats, while Maidens are often scouts. Aiel clans
frequently raid and battle one another, but members of the same society will
not fight one another even if their clans do so. Thus there are
always lines of contact between the clans even during open warfare.
<em>See also</em> Aiel; Aiel Waste; <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>.</dd>

<dt><strong>Aiel Waste</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Harsh, rugged, and all-but-waterless land east of the Spine of
the World. Called the Three-fold Land by the Aiel. Few outsiders
enter; the Aiel consider themselves at war with all other peoples
and do not welcome strangers. Only peddlers, gleemen, and the
Tuatha&rsquo;an are allowed safe entry, although Aiel avoid all contact
with the Tuatha&rsquo;an, whom they call &ldquo;the Lost Ones.&rdquo; No maps of the
Waste itself are known to exist.</dd>



<dt><strong>Ajah</strong> (<strong>AH-jah</strong>):</dt>

<dd>Societies among the Aes Sedai, seven in number and designated
by colors: Blue, Red, White, Green, Brown, Yellow, and Gray. All
Aes Sedai except the Amyrlin Seat belong to one. Each follows a
specific philosophy of the use of the One Power and the purposes of
the Aes Sedai. The Red Ajah bends all its energies to finding men
who can channel, and to gentling them. The Brown Ajah forsakes
involvement with the mundane world and dedicates itself to seeking
knowledge, while the White Ajah, largely eschewing both the world
and the value of worldly knowledge, devotes itself to questions of
philosophy and truth. The Green Ajah (called the Battle Ajah during
the Trolloc Wars) holds itself ready for Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don, the Yellow
concentrates on Healing, and Blue sisters involve themselves with
causes and justice. The Gray are mediators, seeking harmony and
consensus. Rumors of a Black Ajah, dedicated to serving the Dark
One, are officially denied.</dd>

<dt><strong>Alviarin Freidhen</strong> (<strong>ahl-vee-AH-rihn FREYE-dhehn</strong>):</dt>

<dd>An Aes Sedai of the White Ajah, now raised to Keeper of the Chronicles, second only to the Amyrlin Seat among Aes Sedai. A woman of cold logic and colder ambition.</dd>

<dt><strong>Amadicia</strong> (<strong>ah-mah-DEE-cee-ah</strong>):</dt>

<dd>A nation lying south of the Mountains of Mist, between Tarabon and Altara. Its capital Amador (AH-mah-door) is the home of the Children of the Light, whose Lord Captain Commander has, in fact if not in name, more power than the king. Anyone with the ability to channel is outlawed in Amadicia; by law they are to be imprisoned or exiled, but in actuality they are often killed while &ldquo;resisting arrest.&rdquo; The banner of Amadicia is a six-pointed silver star overlaid on a red thistle on a field of blue. <em>See also</em> channel, Children of the Light.</dd>

<dt><strong>Amyrlin Seat</strong> (<strong>AHM-ehr-lin
SEAT</strong>):</dt>

<dd>(1) Leader of the Aes Sedai. Elected for life by the Hall of
the Tower, which consists of three representatives (called Sitters,
as in &ldquo;a Sitter for the Green&rdquo;) from each Ajah. The Amyrlin Seat
has, theoretically, almost supreme authority among the Aes Sedai,
and ranks as the equal of a king or queen. A slightly less formal
usage is &ldquo;the Amyrlin&rdquo;.</dd>

<dd>(2) The throne upon which the leader of the Aes Sedai
sits.</dd>

<dt><strong>Amys</strong> (<strong>ah-MEESE</strong>):</dt>

<dd>Wise One of Cold Rocks Hold, and a dreamwalker. An Aiel of the
Nine Valleys Sept of the Taardad Aiel. Wife of Rhuarc, sister-wife

<dt><strong>Andor</strong> (<strong>AN-door</strong>):</dt>

<dd>A wealthy land which stretches from the Mountains of Mist to the River Erinin, at least on a map, though the queen&rsquo;s control has not reached further west than the River Manetherendrelle in several generations. <em>See also</em> Daughter-Heir.</dd>

<dt><em><strong>angreal</strong></em>
(<strong>anh-gree-AHL</strong>):</dt>

<dd>Remnants of the Age of Legends that allow anyone capable of
channeling the One Power to handle a greater amount of the Power
than would be safely possible unaided. Some were made for use by
women, others by men. Rumors of <em>angreal</em> usable by both men
and women have never been confirmed. Their making is no longer
known, and few remain in existence. <em>See also</em> channel;
<em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>; <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>.</dd>

<dt><strong>Arad Doman</strong> (<strong>AH-rad
do-MAHN</strong>):</dt>

<dd>Nation on the Aryth Ocean. Presently wracked by civil war and
simultaneously by wars against those who have declared for the
Dragon Reborn and against Tarabon. Most Domani merchants are women,
and according to the saying, to &ldquo;let a man trade with a Domani&rdquo; is
to do something extremely foolish. Domani women are famous&mdash;or
infamous&mdash;for their beauty, seductiveness, and scandalous
clothes.</dd>

<dt><strong>Artur Hawkwing</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Legendary king, Artur Paendrag Tanreall (AHR-tuhr PAY-ehn-DRAG
tahn-REE-ahl) Ruled FY 943-994. United all the lands west of the

<dt><strong>Breaking of the World, the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>During the Time of Madness, male Aes Sedai who had gone insane,
and who could wield the One Power to a degree now unknown, changed
the face of the earth. They caused great earthquakes, leveled old
mountain ranges and raised new mountains, lifted dry land where
seas had been and made the ocean rush in where dry land had been.
Many parts of the world were completely depopulated, and the
survivors were scattered like dust on the wind. This destruction is
remembered in stories, legends, and history as the Breaking of the
World. <em>See also</em> Time of Madness.</dd>

<dd>Both a nation along the Spine of the World and the capital city
of that nation. The city was burned and looted during the Aiel War,
as were many other towns and villages. The subsequent abandonment
of farmland near the Spine of the World made necessary the
importation of great quantities of grain. The assassination of King
Galldrian (998 NE) resulted in a civil war for succession to the
Sun Throne, causing the disruption of grain shipments and famine.
The sign of Cairhien is a many-rayed golden sun rising from the
bottom of a field of sky blue.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>Callandor</em></strong>
(<strong>CAH-lahn-DOOR</strong>):</dt>

<dd>The Sword That Is Not A Sword, the Sword That Cannot Be

sign of the Dragon&rsquo;s Rebirth and the approach of Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don. Replaced in the Heart, driving into the stone, by Rand a&rsquo;Thor. <em>See also</em> Dragon Reborn, the; <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>; Stone of

defeat of the Dark One and the destruction of all Darkfriends.
Founded during the War of the Hundred Years by Lothair Mantelar
(LOH-thayr MAHN-tee-LAHR) to proselytize against an increase in
Darkfriends, they evolved during the war into a completely military
organization, extremely rigid in their beliefs, and completely
certain that only they know the truth and the right. They hate Aes
Sedai, considering them, and any who support or befriend them,
Darkfriends. They are known disparagingly as Whitecloaks. Their
sign is a golden sunburst on a field of white. <em>See also</em>
Questioners.</dd>

<dt><strong>Colavaere</strong> (<strong>COH-lah-veer</strong>):</dt>

<dd>A high-ranking lady of Cairhien, manipulative and scheming, which is to describe Cairhienin nobility in general, who has so much power that she sometimes forgets her own vulnerability to a greater.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>damane</em></strong>
(<strong>dah-MAHN-ee</strong>):</dt>

<dd>In the Old Tongue, literally &ldquo;leashed one.&rdquo; Seanchan term for

power and rewards, and even immortality, when he is freed.</dd>

<dt><strong>Dark One</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Most common name, used in every land, for Shai&rsquo;tan (SHAY-ih-TAN). The source
of evil, antithesis of the Creator. Imprisoned by the Creator in
Shayol Ghul at the moment of Creation. An attempt to free him
brought about the War of the Shadow, the tainting of
<em>saidin</em>, the Breaking of the World, and the end of the Age
of Legends.</dd>

<dt><strong>Dark One, naming the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Saying the true name of the Dark One (Shai&rsquo;tan) draws his
attention, inevitably bringing ill fortune at best, disaster at
worst. For that reason, many euphemisms are used, among them the
Dark One, Father of Lies, Sightblinder, Lord of the Grave, Shepherd
of the Night, Heartsbane, Soulsbane, Heartfang, Old Grim,
Grassburner, and Leafblighter. Darkfriends call him the Great Lord
of the Dark. Someone who seems to be inviting ill fortune is often
said to be &ldquo;naming the Dark One.&rdquo;</dd>

<dt><strong>Daughter-Heir</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Title of the heir to the Lion Throne of Andor. Without a surviving
daughter, the throne goes to the nearest female blood relation of
the Queen. Dissension over exactly who was nearest by blood has several times led to power struggles, the latest being &ldquo;the Succession&rdquo;&mdash;so called in Andor and &ldquo;the Third War of Andoran Succession&rdquo; elsewhere&mdash;which brought Morgase of House Trakand to the throne.</dd>

<dt><strong>Dobraine</strong> (<strong>doh-BRAIN</strong>) <strong>of House Taborwin</strong> (<strong>tah-BOHR-wihn</strong>):</dt>

<dd>A high-ranking lord of Cairhien who believes in keeping the letter of his oaths.</dd>

<dt><strong>Dragon, false</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Occasionally men claim to be the Dragon Reborn, and sometimes
one of them gains following enough to require an army to put it
down. Some have begun wars that involved many nations. Over the
centuries most of these have been men unable to channel the One
Power, but a few could do so. All, however, either disappeared or
were captured or killed without fulfilling any of the Prophecies
concerning the Rebirth of the Dragon. These men are called false
Dragons. Among those who could channel, the most powerful were
Raolin Darksbane (335-36AB), Yurian Stonebow (circa 1300-1308 AB),
Davian (FY 351), Guaire Amalasan (FY 939-43), and Logain (997 NE).
<em>See also</em> Dragon Reborn.</dd>

<dt><strong>Dragon, Prophecies of the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Generally little known and seldom spoken of, the Prophecies,
given in <em>The Karaethon Cycle</em> (ka-REE-ah-thon), foretell
that the Dark One will be freed again to touch the world. And that
Lews Therin Telamon, the Dragon, Breaker of the World, will be
reborn to fight Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don, the Last Battle against the Shadow.
He will, say the Prophecies, save the world&mdash;and Break it
again. <em>See also</em> Dragon, the.</dd>

<dd>The name by which Lews Therin Telamon was known during the War
of the Shadow. In the madness that overtook all male Aes Sedai,

Kinslayer. <em>See also</em> Hundred Companions, the; Dragon
Reborn; Dragon, Prophecies of the.</dd>

<dd>There are threads to the One Power, named according to the
sorts of things that can be done using them&mdash;Earth, Air
(sometimes called Wind), Fire, Water, and Spirit, which are called
the Five Powers. Any wielder of the Power will have a greater
degree of strength with one, or possibly two, of these, and lesser
with the others. In the Age of Legends, Spirit was found equally in
men and in women, great ability with Earth and/or Fire was found
much more often among men, with Water and/or Air among women.
Despite exceptions, it was so often so that Earth and Fire came to
be regarded as male Powers, Air and Water as female.</dd>

sword, point down.</dd>

<dt><strong>Game of Houses, the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Name given the scheming, plots, and manipulations for advantage
by the noble Houses. Great value is given to subtlety, to aiming at
one thing while seeming to aim at another, and to achieving ends
with the least visible effort. Also known as the Great Game, and
sometimes by its name in the Old Tongue: <em>Daes Dae&rsquo;mar</em>
(DAH-ess day-MAR).</dd>

<dt><strong>Gareth Bryne</strong>
(<strong>GAH-reth BRIHN</strong>):</dt>

<dd>Once Captain-General of the Queen&rsquo;s Guards in Andor. Exiled by Queen Morgase. Considered one of the greatest generals living. The sigil of House Bryne is a wild bull, the rose crown of Andor around its neck. Gareth Bryne&rsquo;s personal sigil is three golden stars, each of five rays.</dd>

Trakand (<strong>trah-KAND</strong>):</dt>

<dd>Queen Morgase&rsquo;s son, and Elayne&rsquo;s brother, who will be First
Prince of the Sword when Elayne ascends to the throne. His sign is
a white boar.</dd>
<dt><strong>gentling</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The act, performed by Aes Sedai, of shutting off a male who can
channel from the One Power. This is necessary because any man who
learns to channel will go insane from the taint on <em>saidin</em>
and will almost certainly do horrible things with the Power in his
madness. A man who has been gentled can still sense the True
Source, but he cannot touch it. Whatever madness has come before
gentling is arrested by the act of gentling, but not cured by it,
and if it is done soon enough death can be averted. <em>See
also</em> One Power; stilling.</dd>

that to use his true name would be blasphemous.</dd>

<dt><strong>Great Serpent</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A symbol for time and eternity, ancient before the Age of
Legends began, consisting of a serpent eating its own tail. A ring
in the shape of the Great Serpent is awarded to women who have been
raised to the Accepted among the Aes Sedai.</dd>


<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dt><strong>High Lords of Tear</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Acting as a council, the High Lords are the rules of the nation
of Tear, which has neither king nor queen. Their numbers are not
fixed, and have varied over the years from as many as twenty to as
few as six. Not to be confused with the Lords of the Land, who are
lesser Tairen lords.</dd>

<dd>In the Old Tongue, &ldquo;honor and obligation&rdquo; or &ldquo;honor and duty.&rdquo; The complex code by which Aiel live, and which would take a shelf of volumes to explain. By way of small example, there are many paths to gain honor in battle. The smallest is to kill, for anyone can kill. The greatest is to touch an armed and living enemy without causing harm. Somewhere in the middle is to make an enemy <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>. For another example, shame, which also has many levels in <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>, is considered on many of those levels to be worse than pain, injury or even death. For a third, there are, again, many degrees of <em>toh</em>, or obligation, but even the smallest of these must be met in full. <em>Toh</em> outweighs other considerations to the extent that an Aiel will often accept shame, if necessary, to fulfill an obligation that might seem minor to an outlander.  <em>See also</em> <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>.</dd>

<dt><strong>Mayene</strong> (<strong>may-EHN</strong>):</dt>

<dd>City-state on the Sea of Storms that derives its wealth and its
independence from knowledge of where to find the oilfish shoals,

offspring of Trollocs in which the human stock used to create the
Trollocs has resurfaced, but tainted by the evil that made the
Trollocs. Physically they are like men except they have no eyes,

stemming from the Dark One, including the ability to cause
paralyzing fear with a look and the ability to vanish wherever

<dd>A woman once the Wisdom of Emond&rsquo;s Field, in the Two Rivers district of Andor. Now one of the Accepted.</dd>

<dt>&nbsp;</dt>



<dt><strong>Oaths, Three</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The oaths taken by an Accepted who is being raised to Aes
Sedai. Spoken while holding the Oath Rod, a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>
that makes oaths binding. They are:</dd>

<dd>(1) To speak no word that is not true.</dd>

<dd>(2) To make no weapon with which one man may kill another.</dd>

<dd>(3) Never to use the One Power as a weapon except against
Shadowspawn, or in the last extreme of defense of her own life, or
that of her Warder, or another Aes Sedai.</dd>

<dd>These oaths were not always required, but various events before
and since the Breaking caused them to be necessary. The second oath
was the first adopted, in response to the War of the Shadow. The
first oath, while held to the letter, is often circumvented by
careful speaking. It is believed that the last two are
inviolable.</dd>

<dt><strong>Ogier</strong> (<strong>OH-geer</strong>):</dt>

<dd>A non-human race, characterized by great height (ten feet
is average for adult males), broad, almost snout-like noses, and
long, tufted ears. They live in areas called <em>stedding</em>, which they rarely leave, and they typically have little contact with humankind. Knowledge of them among humans
is sparse, and many belive Ogier to be only legends, though they are wondrous
stonemasons and built most of the great cities after the Breaking.</dd>

<dt><strong>Old Tongue</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The language spoken during the Age of Legends. It is generally
expected that nobles and the educated will have learned to speak
this, but most know only a few words. Translation is often
difficult, as it is a language capable of many subtly different
meanings.</dd>

<dt><strong>One Power, the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The power drawn from the True Source. The vast majority of
people are completely unable to learn to channel the One Power. A
very small number can be taught to channel, and an even tinier
number have the ability inborn. For these few there is no need to
be taught; they will touch the True Source and channel the Power
whether they want to or not, perhaps without even realizing what
they are doing. This inborn ability usually manifests itself in
late adolescence or early adulthood. If control is not taught, or
self-learned (extremely difficult, with a success rate of only one
in four), death is certain. Since the Time of Madness, no man has
been able to channel the Power without eventually going completely,
horribly mad, and then, even if he has learned some control, dying
from a wasting sickness that causes the sufferer to rot alive, a
sickness caused, as is the madness, by the Dark One&rsquo;s taint on
<em>saidin</em>. For a woman the death that comes without control
of the Power is less horrible, but it is death just the same. Aes
Sedai search for girls with the inborn ability as much to save
their lives as to increase Aes Sedai numbers, and for men with it
in order to stop the terrible things they inevitably do with the
Power in their madness. <em>See also</em> Aes Sedai; channel; Five
Powers; Time of Madness; True Source.</dd>

<dt>&nbsp;</dt>

<dt><strong>Pattern of an Age</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The Wheel of Time weaves the threads of human lives into the
Pattern of an Age, often called simply the Pattern, which forms the
substance of reality for that Age. <em>See also</em>
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>.</dd>

<dt>&nbsp;</dt>

<dt><strong>Rand al&rsquo;Thor</strong> (<strong>RAND ahl-THOR</strong>):</dt>

<dd>A young man from Emond&rsquo;s Field, in the Two Rivers district of Andor, who is <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>. Once a shepherd. Now proclaimed as the Dragon Reborn, and also as He Who Comes With the Dawn, prophecied to unite the Aiel and break them. It also seems likely that he is the Coramoor, or Chosen One, sought by the Sea Folk. <em>See also</em> Aiel; Dragon Reborn.</dd>


<dt><strong>Rhuarc</strong> (<strong>RHOURK</strong>):</dt>

<dd>An Aiel, clan chief of the Taardad Aiel.</dd>

<dt><strong>Rhuidean</strong> (<strong>RHUY-dee-ahn</strong>):</dt>

<dd>A great city, the only one in the Aiel Waste and totally unknown to the outside world. Abandoned for nearly three thousand years. Once men among the Aiel were allowed to enter Rhuidean only once, in order to be tested, inside a great <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, for fitness to become clan chief (only one in three survived), and women only twice, for testing in that same <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> and again to become Wise Ones, though with a considerably higher survival rate. Now the city is inhabited again, by Aiel, and a great lake occupies one end of the valley of Rhuidean, fed by an underground ocean of fresh water and in turn feeding the only river in the Waste.</dd>

<dt>&nbsp;</dt>

<dt><em><strong>sa&rsquo;angreal</strong></em>
(<strong>SAH-ahn-GREE-ahl</strong>):</dt>

<dd>Any one of a number of objects that allow channelling much more
of the One Power than would otherwise be possible or safe. A
<em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> is like unto, but much more powerful than, an
<em>angreal</em>. The amount of the Power that can be wielded with
a <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> compares to the amount of the Power that can
be handled with an <em>angreal</em> as the power wielded with the
aid of an <em>angreal</em> does to the amount of the Power that can
be handled unaided. The making of them is no longer known. As with
<em>angreal</em>, there are male and female <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>.
Only a handful remain, far fewer even than <em>angreal</em>.</dd>


<dt><strong><em>saidar</em></strong> (<strong>sah-ih-DAHR</strong>):
<strong><em>saidin</em></strong> (<strong>sah-ih-DEEN</strong>):</dt>

<dd><em>See</em> True Source.</dd>

<dt><strong>Seanchan</strong> (<strong>SHAWN-CHAN</strong>):</dt>

<dd>(1) Descendants of the armies Artur Hawkwing sent across the
Aryth Ocean, who conquered the lands there. They believe that any
woman who can channel must be controlled for the safety of everyone
else, and any man who can channel must be killed for the same
reason.</dd>

<dd>(2) The land from which the Seanchan come.</dd>

<dt><strong>Seekers for Truth</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A police/spy organization of the Seanchan Imperial Throne.
Although most are property of the Imperial family, they have wide
powers. Even one of the Blood (a Seanchan noble) can be arrested
for failure to answer any question put by a Seeker, or for failure
to cooperate fully with a Seeker, this last defined by the Seekers
themselves, subject only to review by the Empress.</dd>

<dt><strong>Shayol Ghul</strong> (<strong>SHAY-ol
GHOOL</strong>):</dt>

<dd>A mountain in the Blasted Lands, the site of the Dark One&rsquo;s
prison.</dd>

<dt><strong>Siuan Sanche</strong> (<strong>SWAHN
SAHN-chay</strong>):</dt>

<dd>The daughter of a Tairen fisherman, she was, according to
Tairen law, put on a ship to Tar Valon before the second sunset
after it was discovered that she had the potential to channel.
Once Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah and later Amyrlin Seat, she was deposed and stilled. Now seeking to avoid the fate she fears.</dd>


<dt><strong>Spine of the World</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A towering mountain range, with few passes, which separates the Aiel Waste from the lands to the west. Also called the Dragonwall.</dd>

<dt><strong>stilling</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The act, performed by Aes Sedai, of shutting off a woman who
can channel from the One Power. A woman who has been stilled can
sense the True Source, but she cannot touch it. So seldom has it
been done that novices are required to learn the names and crimes
of all women who have suffered it. Officially, stilling is the
result of trial and sentence for a crime. When it happens
accidentally, it is called being burned out. In practice, the term
stilling is often used for both.</dd>

<dt><strong>Stone of Tear</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A great fortress in the city of Tear, said to have been made by
use of the One Power soon after the Breaking of the World. Attacked
and besieged countless times, it fell in a single night to the
Dragon Reborn and a few hundred Aiel, thus fulfilling two parts of
the Prophecies of the Dragon. The Stone contains a collection of
<em>an&rsquo;greal</em> and <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> rivaling that of the
White Tower, a collection which was gathered, some say, in an
attempt to diminish the glare of possessing
<em>Callandor</em>.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>sul&rsquo;dam</em></strong> (<em>SOOL-dam</em>):</dt>

<dd>Literally, &ldquo;leash holder.&rdquo; Seanchan term for a woman with the
ability to control, by means of an <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>, a woman who can
channel. A
fairly honored position among the Seanchan. What is known to only a few is that
<em>sul&rsquo;dam</em> are in fact those women who could be taught to channel. <em>See also
a&rsquo;dam</em>; <em>damane</em>; Seanchan.</dd>

<dt>&nbsp;</dt>

<dt><strong>Talents</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Abilities in the use of the One Power in specific areas. The
best known of these, of course, is Healing. Some, such as
Traveling, the ability to shift oneself from one place to another
without crossing the intervening space, have been lost. Others such
as Foretelling (the ability to foretell future events, but in a
general way) are now found only rarely if at all. Another Talent
long thought lost is Dreaming, which involves, among other things,
interpreting the Dreamers dreams to foretell future events in more
specific fashion than Foretelling does. Some Dreamers had the
ability to enter <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, the World of Dreams, and
(it is said) even other people&rsquo;s dreams. The last known Dreamer was
Corianin Nedeal (coh-ree-AHN-ihn neh-dee-AHL), who died in 526 NE,
but there is now another, known to but a few.</dd>

<dt><strong>Tallanvor, Martyn</strong> (<strong>TAL-lahn-vohr, mahr-TEEN</strong>):</dt>

<dd>Capital city of Tarabon. <em>See</em> Tarabon.</dd>

<dt><strong>Tarabon</strong> (<strong>TAH-rah-BON</strong>):</dt>

<dd>Nation on the Aryth Ocean. Once a great trading nation, a source of rugs,
dyes, and fireworks produced by the Guild of Illuminators, among
other things. Now wracked by civil war, as well as simultaneous
wars against Arad Doman and people sworn to the Dragon Reborn.</dd>

<dt><strong>Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don</strong> (<strong>TAHR-mohn

<dd><em>See</em> Dragon, the.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em></strong>
(<strong>tel-AYE-rahn-rhee-ODD</strong>):</dt>

<dd>In the Old Tongue, &ldquo;the Unseen World&rdquo;, or &ldquo;the World of
Dreams.&rdquo; A world glimpsed in dreams which was believed by the
ancients to permeate and surround all other possible worlds. Many can touch <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> for a few moments in their dreams, but few have ever had the ability to enter it at will, though some <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> have recently been discovered to confer that ability. Unlike
other dreams, what happens to living things in the World of Dreams
is real; a wound taken there will still be there on awakening, and
one who dies there does not wake at all. <em>See also ter&rsquo;angreal</em>.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em></strong>
(<strong>TEER-ahn-GREE-ahl</strong>):</dt>

<dd>Any one of a number of remnants of the Age of Legends that use
the One Power. Unlike <em>angreal</em> and <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>,
each <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> was made to do a particular thing. For
example, one makes oaths taken within it binding. Some are used by
Aes Sedai, but their original purposes are largely unknown. Some
will kill or destroy the ability to channel of any woman who uses
them. <em>See also</em> <em>angreal</em>; <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>.</dd>

<dt><strong>Merrilin, Thom</strong> (<strong>MER-rih-lihn,
TOM</strong>):</dt>

<dd>A not-so-simple gleeman and traveler. <em>See also</em> gleeman.</dd>

<dt><strong>Time of Madness</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The years after the Dark One&rsquo;s counterstroke tainted the male
half of the True Source, when male Aes Sedai went mad and Broke the
World. The exact duration of this period is unknown, but it is
believed to have lasted nearly one hundred years. It ended
completely only with the death of the last male Aes Sedai. <em>See
also</em> Hundred Companions; True Source; One Power; Breaking of
the World.</dd>


<dt><strong>Trollocs</strong> (<strong>TRAHL-lohks</strong>):</dt>

<dd>Creatures of the Dark One, created during the War of the
Shadow. Huge in stature, they are a twisted blend of animal and
human stock. Vicious by nature, they kill for the pure pleasure of
killing. Deceitful in the extreme, they cannot be trusted unless
coerced by fear. They are divided into tribe-like bands, among them
the Dha&rsquo;vol, the Ko&rsquo;bal, and the Dhai&rsquo;mon.</dd>

<dt><strong>Trolloc Wars</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A series of wars, beginning about 1000 AB and lasting more than
three hundred years, during which Trolloc armies ravaged the world.
Eventually the Trollocs were slain or driven back into the Great
Blight, but some nations ceased to exist, while others were almost
depopulated. All records of the time are fragmentary.</dd>

<dt><strong>True Source</strong>:</dt>

<dd>The driving force of the universe, which turns the Wheel of
Time. It is divided into a male half (<em>saidin</em>) and a female half
(<em>saidar</em>), which work at the same time with and against each other.
Only a man can draw on <em>saidin</em>, only a woman on
<em>saidar</em>. Since the beginning of the Time of Madness,
<em>saidin</em> has been tainted by the Dark One&rsquo;s touch. <em>See
also</em> One Power.</dd>

<dt>&nbsp;</dt>



<dt><strong>Verin Mathwin</strong> (<strong>VEHR-ihn
MAH-thwin</strong>):</dt>

<dd>Aes Sedai of the Brown Ajah, last known to be in the Two Rivers purportedly seeking girls who could be taught to channel. <em>See also</em> Ajah.</dd>

<dt>&nbsp;</dt>

<dt><strong>Warder</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A warrior bonded to an Aes Sedai. The bonding is a thing of the
One Power, and by it he gains such gifts as quick healing, the
ability to go long periods without food, water, or rest, and the
ability to sense the taint of the Dark One at a distance. So long
as a Warder lives, the Aes Sedai to whom he is bonded knows he is
alive however far away he is, and when he dies she will know the
moment and manner of his death. The bonding does not tell her how
far he is, though, nor in what direction. While most Ajahs believe
an Aes Sedai may have one Warder bonded to her at a time, the Red
Ajah refuses to bond any Warders at all, while the Green Ajah
believe an Aes Sedai may bond as many Warders as she wishes.
Ethically the Warder must accede to the bonding, but it has been
known to be done involuntarily. What the Aes Sedai gain from the
bonding is a closely held secret. <em>See
also</em> Aes Sedai.</dd>

<dt><strong>War of Power</strong>:</dt>

<dd><em>See</em> War of the Shadow.</dd>

<dt><strong>War of the Hundred Years</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A series of overlapping wars among constantly shifting
alliances, precipitated by the death of Artur Hawkwing and the
resulting struggle for his empire. It lasted from FY 994 to FY
1117. The war depopulated large parts of the lands between the
Aryth Ocean and the Aiel Waste, from the Sea of Storms to the Great
Blight. So great was the destruction that only fragmentary records
of the time remain. The empire of Artur Hawkwing was pulled apart
in the wars, and the nations of the present day were formed.

<dt><strong>War of the Shadow</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Also known as the War of Power, it ended the Age of Legends. It
began shortly after the attempt to free the Dark One, and soon
involved the whole world. In a world where even the memory of war
had been forgotten, every facet of war was rediscovered, often
twisted by the Dark One&rsquo;s touch on the world, and the One Power was
used as a weapon. The war was ended by the resealing of the Dark
One into his prison. <em>See also</em> Hundred Companions, the;

<dt><strong>Wheel of Time, the</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Time is a wheel with seven spokes, each spoke an Age. As the
Wheel turns, the Ages come and go, each leaving memories that fade
to legend, then to myth, and are forgotten by the time that Age
comes again. The Pattern of an Age is slightly different each time
an Age comes, and each time it is subject to greater change, but
each time it is the same Age.</dd>

<dt><strong>wilder</strong>:</dt>

<dd>A woman who has learned to channel the One Power on her own,
surviving the crisis as only one in four does. Such women usually
build barriers against knowing what it is they are doing, but if
these can be broken down, wilders are among the most powerful of
channelers. The term is often used in derogatory fashion.</dd>

<dt><strong>Wisdom</strong>:</dt>

<dd>In villages, a woman chosen by the Women&rsquo;s Circle for her
knowledge of such things as healing, and foretelling the weather,
as well as for common good sense. A position of great
responsibility and authority, both actual and implied. She is
generally considered the equal of the mayor, just as the Women&rsquo;s
Circle is the equal of the Village Council. Unlike the mayor, the
Wisdom is chosen for life, and it is very rare for a Wisdom to be
removed from office before her death. Depending on the land, she
may instead have another title, such as Guide, Healer, Wise Woman,
or Seeker.</dd>

<dt><strong>Wise One</strong>:</dt>

<dd>Among the Aiel, Wise Ones are women chosen by other Wise Ones
and trained in healing, herbs and other things, much like Wisdoms.
Usually there is a single Wise One to each clan or sept hold. They have great authority and
responsibility, as well as great influence with sept and clan
chiefs, though these men often accuse them of meddling. Wise Ones stand outside all feuds and battles, and according to <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em> may not be harmed or impeded in any way. Some Wise Ones have the ability to channel, but they do not advertise this. Three Wise Ones now living are dreamwalkers, with the ability to enter <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> and to speak to other people in their dreams, among other things. <em>See also</em> dreamwalker; <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>; <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.</dd>
