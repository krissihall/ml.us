<h4><em>Weaves of the Power</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
men sitting around the table in the common room
of The Wandering Woman were mainly local. Those who wore the long
vest sported it in bright silk, often brocaded, over pale shirts
with wide sleeves. Garnets or pearls adorned finger rings, hoop
earrings were gold not gilded, and moonstones and sapphires
sparkled on the pommels of curved knives stuck through belts.
Several men had silk coats slung about their shoulders, with a
chain of silver or gold strung between the narrow lapels
embroidered with flowers or animals. The coats looked odd, really&mdash;too small to put on; never meant for anything but a cape&mdash;but their wearers carried long narrow swords as well as the
curved dagger, and seemed equally willing to use either, for a
wrong word, a wrong look, or because they happened to feel like
it.</p>

<p>It was a varied crowd, altogether. Two Murandian
merchants with curled mustaches and those ridiculous little beards
on the point of the chin, and a Domani with hair below his
shoulders and thin mustaches who wore a gold bracelet, a
close-fitting gold necklace, and a large pearl in his left ear. A
dark Atha&rsquo;an Miere in a bright green coat, with tattooed hands
and two knives thrust into a red sash, and a Taraboner with a
transparent veil covering thick mustaches that almost hid his
mouth, and a number of outlanders who might have been from
anywhere. But every man had a pile of coins in front of him, though
the size did vary. So close to the Tarasin Palace, The Wandering
Woman attracted patrons with gold to spare.</p>

<p>Rattling the five dice in the leather cup, Mat spun
them out on the table. They stopped with two crowns, two stars and
a cup showing. A fair toss; no better. His luck ran in waves, and
at the moment the wave seemed low, meaning he won no more than half
his tosses at most. So far he had managed to lose ten in a row, an
unusual run for him at any time. The dice passed to a blue-eyed
outlander, a hard, narrow-faced man who seemed to have plenty of
coin to fling about despite his plain brown coat.</p>

<p>Vanin bent to whisper in Mat&rsquo;s ear.
 &ldquo;They&rsquo;re out again. Thom says he still doesn&rsquo;t know how.&rdquo;
Mat directed a grimace at the fat man that made him straighten more
quickly that you would think someone his size could.</p>

<p>Swallowing half the dewmelon punch in his silver cup,
Mat frowned down the table. Again! The blue-eyed man&rsquo;s toss
rolled across the table, and the dice stopped showing three crowns,
a rose and a rod. Murmurs rounded the table at his win.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood and ashes,&rdquo; Mat muttered. &ldquo;Next, the Daughter
of the Nine Moons is going to walk in and claim me.&rdquo; The blue-eyed
fellow choked on his celebratory drink. &ldquo;Do you know the name?&rdquo; Mat
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My punch went down the wrong way,&rdquo; the man said in a
soft, slurring accent Mat did not recognize. &ldquo;What name was
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat made a pacifying gesture; he had seen fights
start over less. Scraping his gold and silver back into his purse,
he stuffed it into his coat pocket as he rose. &ldquo;I am done. The
Light&rsquo;s blessing on all here.&rdquo; Everyone at the table repeated
the benison, even the outlanders. People were very polite in Ebou
Dar.</p>

<p>Even short of midmorning, the common room was fairly
full, and another dice game added its share of laughter and groans.
Two of Mistress Anan&rsquo;s younger sons were helping the serving
girls hand out late breakfasts. The innkeeper herself was sitting
at the back of the room near the railless white stone stairs,
keeping an eye on everything, with a young, pretty woman whose big
black eyes had a merry twinkle, as though she knew a joke no one
else did. Her face was a perfect oval framed by glossy black hair,
and the deep neckline of her red-belted gray dress showed a
tantalizing view. The amusement in her eyes deepened as she smiled
at Mat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With your luck, Lord Cauthon,&rdquo; Mistress Anan said,
 &ldquo;my husband should ask you where to send his fishing boats.&rdquo; For
some reason, her tone was very dry.</p>

<p>Mat accepted the title without a blink. In Ebou Dar,
few would challenge a lord except other lords; it was a simple
calculation of numbers to him. There were a lot fewer lords than
commoners, which meant fewer chances somebody would try to stick a
knife in him. Even so, he had had to crack three heads in the last
ten days. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid my luck doesn&rsquo;t run to things like
that, Mistress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olver seemed to just pop up at his side. &ldquo;Can we go
horse-racing, Mat?&rdquo; he demanded eagerly.</p>

<p>Frielle, Mistress Anan&rsquo;s middle daughter,
trotted up to catch the boy by the shoulders. &ldquo;Your pardon, Lord
Cauthon,&rdquo; she said anxiously. &ldquo;He just slipped away from me.
Light&rsquo;s truth, he did.&rdquo; Soon to be married&mdash;the snug
silver necklace for her marriage knife already encircled her slim
throat&mdash;she had volunteered to look after Olver, laughing
about how she wanted six sons of her own. Mat suspected she was
beginning to hope for daughters.</p>

<p>It was Nalesean, coming down the stairs, who got
Mat&rsquo;s glare, hard enough to stop the Tairen in his tracks. It
was Nalesean who had entered Wind in two races, with Olver riding&mdash;boys did the riding here&mdash;and Mat not knowing a thing
till it was done. That Wind had proven as fast as his name did not
help matters. Two victories gave Olver a taste for more. &ldquo;Not your
fault, Mistress,&rdquo; Mat told Frielle. &ldquo;Put him in a barrel if you
must, with my blessing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olver gave him an accusatory look, but a moment later
he whipped around to give Frielle an insolent grin he had picked up
somewhere. It looked odd with his big ears and wide mouth; he was
never going to be a handsome lad. &ldquo;I will sit quietly if I can look
at your eyes. You have beautiful eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frielle had a lot of her mother in her, and not just
her looks. She laughed sweetly and chucked him under the chin,
making him blush. Her mother and the big-eyed young woman smiled at
the tabletop.</p>

<p>Shaking his head, Mat started up the stairs. He had
to speak to the boy. He could not just grin like that at every
woman he saw. And telling a woman she had beautiful eyes! At his
age! Mat did not know where Olver got it.</p>

<p>As he came abreast of Nalesean, the man said, &ldquo;They
have sneaked away again, haven&rsquo;t they.&rdquo; It was not a question,
and when Mat nodded, he gave his pointed beard a yank and cursed.
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll assemble the men, Mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nerim was fussing about Mat&rsquo;s room, wiping the
table with a cloth as if the maids had not dusted this morning
already. He shared a smaller room next door with Olver, and rarely
left The Wandering Woman. Ebou Dar was dissolute and uncivilized,
he claimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord is going out?&rdquo; Nerim said lugubriously as
Mat picked up his hat. &ldquo;In that coat? I fear there is a wine stain
from last night on the shoulder. I would have removed it if my Lord
had not donned the garment in haste this morning, and a gash in the
sleeve&mdash;from a knife, I believe&mdash;that I would have
mended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat let him bring out a gray coat with silver scrolls
embroidered on the cuffs and high collar and gave him the
gold-embroidered green.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust my Lord will at least try not to get blood
on it today. Bloodstains are very difficult to remove.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a compromise they had worked out. Mat put up
with Nerim&rsquo;s dismal face and gloomy observations, and let the
man fetch, clean and hand him things he could just as easily pick
up himself; in return Nerim agreed, reluctantly, not to try
actually dressing him.</p>

<p>Checking the knives snugged up his sleeves, under his
coat and in the turned-down tops of his boots, Mat left his spear
leaning in the corner with his unstrung bow and went down to the
front of the inn. That spear seemed to draw idiots who wanted to
fight the way honey drew flies.</p>

<p>In spite of his hat, sweat beaded on Mat&rsquo;s face
the moment he stepped from the shade and relative coolness of the
inn. The morning sun would have done for high noon in midsummer in
ordinary times, but Mol Hara Square was thronged with people. At
first he stood frowning at the Tarasin Palace. With Juilin and Thom
watching inside and Vanin out, how were they managing to leave
without being seen? They went out almost every single day. After it
happened three times, Mat had set men watching every way out of
that domed heap of white stone and plaster, taking their places
before dawn. There were just enough of them, with him and
Nalesean. No one had seen hide nor hair, but just before midday
Thom came out to say the women had gone somehow. The old gleeman
seemed at his wits&rsquo; end, ready to tear out his mustaches. Mat
knew what was going on. They were doing it just to spite him.</p>

<p>Nalesean and the others were waiting in a glum
sweating knot. Nalesean was fingering his sword hilt as though he
would like an opportunity to use it today.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look across the river today,&rdquo; Mat said.
Several of the Redarms exchanged uneasy glances; they had heard the
stories.</p>

<p>Vanin shifted his feet, shook his head. &ldquo;A waste of
time,&rdquo; he said flatly. &ldquo;Lady Elayne would never go anywhere like
that. The Aiel woman maybe, or Birgitte, but not Lady Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat closed his eyes for a moment. How had Elayne
managed to ruin a good man in so short a time? He kept hoping that
enough time away from her influence would set Vanin right, but he
was beginning to lose hope. Light, but he despised noblewomen.
 &ldquo;Well, if we don&rsquo;t see them today, we can forget the Rahad&mdash;they&rsquo;ll stand out like painted larks in a flock of
blackbirds over there&mdash;but I intend to find them if
they&rsquo;re hiding under a bed in the Pit of Doom. Search in
pairs, as usual, and watch each other&rsquo;s back. Now to find some
boatmen to ferry us across. Burn me, I hope they&rsquo;re not all
out selling fruit to the Sea Folk ships.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">To Elayne the street looked as it had in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, brick buildings five and six stories
high, covered patchily with flaking white plaster, crowded together
and looming above uneven pavement. Only at this time of day, with
the golden sun burning overhead, did shadows vanish completely from
these narrow ways. Flies buzzed everywhere. The only differences
from the World of Dreams were the laundry hanging from windows, the
people&mdash;not many outdoors at the moment, of course&mdash;and
the smell, a deep pungent miasma of decay that made her try not to
breathe too deeply. Unfortunately, every street looked alike in the
Rahad.</p>

<p>Halting Birgitte with a hand on her arm, she eyed a
scabrous pile of brick with dingy washing dangling from half the
windows. The thin wail of a baby crying came from somewhere inside.
It had the right number of floors, six. She was certain it had been
six. Nynaeve insisted on five.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we should stand staring,&rdquo;
Birgitte said softly. &ldquo;People are looking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was not quite true, just Birgitte worrying about
her. Shirtless men in often ragged vests strutted down the street
with sunlight glinting on their brass hoop earrings, and brass
finger rings set with colored glass, or slunk along like the sort
of cur dog that might snarl and might bite. For that matter, so did
the women, in their usually worn dresses and <em>their</em> jewelry
of brass and glass. Everyone had a curved knife stuck through a
belt, and frequently a plain work knife as well.</p>

<p>In truth, no one gave her and Birgitte a second
glance, though Birgitte&rsquo;s aged face was often challenging and
she herself was tall for an Ebou Dari woman. That was what they
saw, by way of not so simple weaves of Air and Fire that Elayne had
inverted and tied off herself. When Elayne looked at Birgitte, she
saw a woman with fine wrinkles at the corners of black eyes and
black hair touched with gray. The disguises were easier the closer
you stayed to how a person really was, so the hair flowing down
Birgitte&rsquo;s back, tied in four places with tattered green
ribbon, was considerably longer than Ebou Dari women wore it, but
then Elayne had not cut her hair either, and no one seemed to pay
it any mind. It was a perfect disguise; she just wished she did not
have to sweat as well. With the addition of the even more complex
weave of Spirit that masked a woman&rsquo;s ability to channel,
Elayne had walked right by Merilille on her way out of the palace
that morning. She wore it still; they had seen Vandene and Adeleas
on this side of the river more than once.</p>

<p>Their clothes were not part of the weaves, of course,
but threadbare woolen dresses with frayed embroidery on the sleeves
and around the deep narrow necklines. Their shifts and stockings
were wool too, and Elayne&rsquo;s, at least, itched. Tylin had
provided the garments, along with various pieces of advice, and the
white-sheathed marriage knives. It seemed that married women were
less likely to be challenged than unmarried, and widows who
rejected another marriage least of all. Age helped, too. No one
challenged a gray-haired grandmother, though she might you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we should go in,&rdquo; Elayne said, and Birgitte
moved ahead of her, one hand on the knife in her coarse brown
woolen belt, to push open the unpainted door. Inside was a dim
hallway lined with rough doors, and a steep narrow stairway of
chipped brick at the back. Elayne did not quite sigh in relief.</p>

<p>White sheaths or no white sheaths, walking into a
building where you did not belong was one good way to end up in a
knife fight here. So was asking questions, or being curious. Tylin
had counseled against that, but on the first day they had visited
inns, marked only by blue doors, planning to say they were buying
things out of old storerooms to refurbish and sell. She had paired
with Birgitte and set Nynaeve with Aviendha so they could cover
more ground. The common rooms were dark, grimy places, and twice in
as many stops, Birgitte had hustled her out, both of them with
daggers in hand, just before serious trouble started. The second
time, Elayne had to channel briefly, tripping a pair of women who
came after them into the street, and even so Birgitte had been
certain that someone had followed them the rest of the day. Nynaeve
and Aviendha had the same sort of difficulty, except for being
followed; Nynaeve had actually hit another woman with a stool. So
even innocuous questions were abandoned, and they hoped they did
not walk through a doorway into a knife.</p>

<p>Birgitte climbed the steep stairs ahead, though she
often glanced behind, too. The smells of cooking blended with the
general stench of the Rahad in a quite sickening fashion. The baby
stopped crying, but somewhere in the building a woman began
shouting. On the third floor a thick-shouldered man without shirt
or vest opened a door just as they came up. Birgitte frowned at
him, and he raised both hands, palms toward them, and backed out of
the hallway again, kicking the door shut as he did. On the top
floor, where the storeroom should have been if this was the right
building, a gaunt woman in a coarse linen shift was sitting on a
stool in the doorway, catching what little breeze was stirring
while she sharpened her dagger. Her head swiveled toward them, and
the blade stopped moving across the honing stone. She did not look
away from them as they backed slowly down the stairway, and the
soft rasp of metal on stone did not begin again until they reached
the bottom of the flight. Elayne did let out a relieved breath
then.</p>

<p>She was more than glad Nynaeve had not taken her
wager. Ten days. She had been an optimistic fool. This was the
eleventh day since her boast, eleven days when sometimes she
thought she was on the same street in the evening as the morning,
eleven days without a clue to the bowl. Sometimes they had remained
in the palace just to clear their heads. It was all so frustrating.
At least Vandene and Adeleas were having no luck either. As far as
Elayne could see, no one in the Rahad would speak two willing words
to Aes Sedai. People melted away as soon as they realized what they
were; she had seen two women try to stab Adeleas, no doubt to rob
the fool walking the Rahad in a silk dress, and by the time the
Brown sister lifted the pair on flows of Air and stuffed them
through a window two floors up, there was not another person in
sight. Well, she was not going to allow those two to find her bowl
and snatch it from under her nose.</p>

<p>Once back in the street, she had yet another reminder
that there were worse things in the Rahad than frustration. Right
in front of her, a slender man with blood all over his chest and a
knife in his hand came leaping out of a doorway, spinning
immediately to face another man who followed; the second was taller
and heavier and bleeding down the side of his face. They circled
each other, eyes locked, extended blades flickering and probing. A
small crowd gathered to watch as though springing from the rough
pavement; none came running, but no one passed by.</p>

<p>Elayne and Birgitte moved to the side of the street,
but they did not leave. In the Rahad, leaving would attract
attention, the last thing they wanted. Blending in meant watching,
but Elayne managed to focus beyond the two men, seeing only vague
blurs of quick motion until suddenly the motion slowed. She blinked
and made herself look. The man with blood on his chest was parading
about, grinning and gesturing with a blade that dripped red. The
bigger man lay facedown in the street, giving harsh feeble coughs,
not twenty paces from her.</p>

<p>Elayne moved instinctively&mdash;her minuscule
ability in Healing was better than none when a man was bleeding to
death, and to the Pit of Doom with what anyone here thought of Aes
Sedai&mdash;yet before she took a second step, another woman was
kneeling at the man&rsquo;s side. A little older than Nynaeve
perhaps, she wore a red-belted blue dress in somewhat better repair
than most in the Rahad. Elayne took her for the dying man&rsquo;s
sweetheart at first, especially when the victor in the duel grew
sober. No one moved to go; everyone watched silently as the woman
turned the man onto his back.</p>

<p>Elayne gave a start as, far from tenderly wiping the
blood from his lips, the woman pulled what seemed to be a handful
of herbs from her pouch and hurriedly thrust some of them into the
man&rsquo;s mouth. Before her hand left his face, the glow of <em>
saidar</em> surrounded her, and she began to weave the flows of
Healing more deftly than Elayne could have done. The man gasped
hard enough to expel most of the leaves, shuddered&mdash;and lay
still, half-open eyes staring at the sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too late, it seems.&rdquo; Standing, the woman faced the
lean fellow. &ldquo;You must tell Masic&rsquo;s wife you&rsquo;ve killed
her husband, Baris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Asra,&rdquo; Baris replied meekly.</p>

<p>Asra turned away without another glance at either
man, and the thin crowd opened up before her. As she passed within
a few paces of Elayne and Birgitte, Elayne noticed two things about
her. One was her strength; Elayne felt for that on purpose. She
expected to feel a fair amount, but Asra likely would never have
been allowed to take the test for Accepted. Healing must have been
her strongest Talent&mdash;perhaps her only one, since she must be
a wilder&mdash;and very well honed from use. Maybe she even
believed those herbs were necessary. The second thing Elayne
noticed was the woman&rsquo;s face. It was not sun-dark, as she had
supposed at first. Asra was most certainly Domani. What under the
Light was a Domani wilder doing in the Rahad?</p>

<p>Elayne might have followed the woman, except that
Birgitte drew her the other way. &ldquo;I recognize that look in your
eyes, Elayne.&rdquo; Birgitte&rsquo;s eyes scanned the street as if she
expected some of the passersby to be eavesdroppers. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know why you want to chase after that woman, but she seems to be
respected. Accost her, and you might have more blades drawn than
you and I can handle together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was simple truth, and so was the fact that
Domani wilders were not what she had come to Ebou Dar to find.</p>

<p>Touching Birgitte&rsquo;s arm, she nodded toward two
men just rounding the corner ahead. In his satin-striped blue coat,
Nalesean looked every inch the Tairen lord; the padded coat was
done up to his neck, and his sweaty face glistened almost as much
as his oiled beard. He glared at anyone who so much as glanced at
him, to such an extent that he surely would have been in a fight by
now except that he was caressing his sword hilt as if he would
welcome one. Mat, on the other hand, did not grimace at all. He
swaggered along, and except for an air of disgruntlement, he could
have been enjoying himself. With his coat hanging open and his hat
pulled low and that scarf tied around his neck, he looked as if he
had spent the night crawling through taverns, which he might very
well have. To her surprise, she realized she had not thought of him
in days. She itched to lay hands on his <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>,
but the bowl was infinitely more important.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It never struck me before,&rdquo; Birgitte murmured, &ldquo;but
I think Mat is the more dangerous of those two. A N&rsquo;Shar in
Mameris. I wonder what they&rsquo;re doing this side of the
Eldar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne stared at her. A what where? &ldquo;They have
probably drunk all the wine on the other side. Really, Birgitte, I
do wish you&rsquo;d keep your mind on what we are about.&rdquo; This time
she was <em>not</em> going to ask.</p>

<p>As Mat and Nalesean sauntered on past, Elayne put
them out of her mind again and began to study the street. It would
be wonderful to find the bowl today. Not least because the next
time they came, she would be paired with Aviendha. She was
beginning to like the woman&mdash;despite her extremely peculiar
notions about Rand and them; extremely!&mdash;but she did have a
tendency to encourage women who seemed ready to draw a knife.
Aviendha even seemed disappointed that men dropped their eyes if
she stared, instead of pulling out a blade the way the women
would!</p>

<p>&ldquo;That one,&rdquo; Elayne said, pointing. Nynaeve could
not be right about five stories. Could she? Elayne did hope Egwene
had found a solution.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Egwene waited patiently while Logain drank some more
water. His tent was not so spacious as his quarters had been in
Salidar, but it was still larger than most in the camp. There had
to be room for the six sisters sitting on stools, maintaining the
shield on him. Egwene&rsquo;s suggestion that it be tied off had
been met with close to shock and not far from scorn; no one was
willing to countenance it, particularly now, so soon after she had
raised four women Aes Sedai without testing or Oath Rod, and
perhaps not ever. Siuan had said they would not. Custom said six,
though if he was as much reduced as Siuan and Leane, any three
sisters in the camp could surely have held him, and custom said the
shield on a man must be maintained, not tied. A single lamp gave a
fitful illumination. She and Logain sat on blankets laid for
rugs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me understand,&rdquo; Logain said when he lowered the
pewter cup. &ldquo;You want to know what <em>I</em> think of
al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s amnesty?&rdquo; Some of the sisters shifted on their
stools, maybe because he had omitted calling her &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; but more
likely because they despised the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want your thoughts, yes. Surely you must have
some. In Caemlyn with him, you would very likely be given a place
of honor. Here, you may be gentled any day. Now. You&rsquo;ve held
off the madness six years, you say. How much chance is there, do
you think, that any men who come to him might do as well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they truly mean to gentle me again?&rdquo; His voice was
quiet, his tone injured and angry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thrown my lot in with
you. I&rsquo;ve done all that was asked. I&rsquo;ve offered to swear
any oath you name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Hall will decide soon. Some would as soon you
died conveniently. If Aes Sedai tell your tale, all know Aes Sedai
cannot lie. But I don&rsquo;t believe you need fear that. You have
served us too well for me to allow you to be harmed. And whatever
happens, you can still serve, and see the Red Ajah punished, as you
wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Logain jerked up onto his knees, snarling, and she
embraced <em>saidar</em> and had him wrapped securely in flows of
Air in the space of a heartbeat. The sisters shielding him had all
their strength directed into that&mdash;another custom; you must
use every bit of your strength to shield a man&mdash;but several
could split their weaves, and one might have diverted part to him
if they thought he might harm her. She did not want to risk him
being injured.</p>

<p>The flows held him there kneeling, but he seemed to
ignore them. &ldquo;You want to know what I think of al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s
amnesty? I wish I were with him now! Burn you all! I have done
everything you asked! The Light burn you all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be calm, Master Logain.&rdquo; Egwene was surprised her
voice came out so steady. Her heart was racing, though certainly
not for fear of him. &ldquo;I swear this to you. I will never harm you,
nor allow you to be harmed by any who follow me if I can help it,
unless you turn against us.&rdquo; The rage had gone from his face,
replaced by woodenness. Was he listening? &ldquo;But the Hall will do as
it decides. Are you calm, now?&rdquo; He nodded wearily, and she released
the flows. He sank back to the ground, not looking at her. &ldquo;I will
speak with you about the amnesty when you are more composed.
Perhaps in a day or two.&rdquo; He nodded again, curtly, still not
looking.</p>

<p>As she ducked out into the dusk, the two Warders
standing guard outside bowed to her. At least the Gaidin did not
care that she was eighteen, an Accepted raised Aes Sedai only
because she was raised Amyrlin. To the Warders, an Aes Sedai was an
Aes Sedai, and the Amyrlin was the Amyrlin. Still, she did not let
herself exhale until she was far enough away for the two not to
hear.</p>

<p>The camp was quite large, tents for hundreds of Aes
Sedai spreading through the forest, for Accepted and novices and
servants, carts and wagons and horses everywhere. The cooking smell
of the evening meal hung thick in the air. Around it stretched the
cookfires of Gareth Bryne&rsquo;s army; most men there would be
sleeping on the ground, not in tents. The so-called Band of the Red
Hand lay camped no more than ten miles south; Talmanes never let
that distance vary more than a mile or so either way, day or night
for over two hundred miles. Already they had served part of her
plan for them, as suggested by Siuan and Leane.</p>

<p>Gareth Bryne&rsquo;s force had grown in the sixteen
days since leaving Salidar. Two armies marching slowly northward
through Altara, plainly not friendly toward each other, drew
attention. Nobles flocked in with their levies to ally themselves
with the stronger of the two. True, none of those lords and ladies
would have sworn the oaths they had if they had known there would
be no great battle in their own lands. True, given free choice,
every last one would have ridden the moment they realized
Egwene&rsquo;s target was Tar Valon, not an army of Dragonsworn. But
they <em>had</em> made those oaths, to <em>an</em> Amyrlin at
least, before Aes Sedai who called themselves the Hall of the
Tower, with hundreds more watching. Breaking that kind of vow came
back to haunt you. Besides, even if Egwene&rsquo;s head ended on a
pike in the White Tower, not a one of them believed Elaida would
forget they had sworn. Trapped into alliance they might have been,
and into fealty of a sort, but they would be among the most fervent
of her supporters. Their only way out of that trap with their necks
intact was to see Egwene wearing the stole in Tar Valon.</p>

<p>Siuan and Leane were quite set up over it. Egwene
was not certain how she felt. If there had been some way to remove
Elaida without a drop of blood being shed, she would have leaped at
it. She did not think there was, though.</p>

<p>After a small dinner of goat, turnip and something
she did not inquire after too closely, Egwene retired to her tent.
Not the largest in the camp, but certainly the largest occupied by
one person. Chesa was there, waiting to help Egwene undress,
bubbling over the news that she had acquired some of the finest
linen imaginable from an Altaran lady&rsquo;s maid, filmy material
that would make the coolest shifts imaginable. Often Egwene let
Chesa sleep in the tent with her for the company, though a pallet
of blankets hardly equaled Chesa&rsquo;s own cot. Tonight she sent
the woman away once she was ready for bed. Being Amyrlin entailed a
few privileges. Such as a tent of her own for your maid. Such as
sleeping alone on nights when it was necessary.</p>

<p>Egwene was not tired enough to go to sleep yet, but
that was no trouble. Putting herself to sleep was a simple matter;
she had been trained by Aiel dreamwalkers. She stepped into <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and was standing in the room that had been her
study in the Little Tower for such a brief time. The table and
chairs remained, of course. Furniture was not something you took
away when you set out with an army. Any place felt empty in the
World of Dreams, but those that really were more than most. Already
the Little Tower felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;hollow.</p>

<p>Abruptly, she realized the Amyrlin&rsquo;s stole was
draped around her neck. She made it vanish just in time. An instant
later Nynaeve and Elayne were there, Nynaeve as solid as she,
Elayne misty. Siuan had been reluctant to let go of the original
ring <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>; a firm order had been necessary.
Elayne wore a green dress with lace spilling over her hands and
outlining a narrow yet startlingly deep neckline that revealed a
small knife dangling from a snug gold necklace, the hilt nestled
between her breasts a mass of pearls and firedrops. Elayne always
did seem to embrace the local fashions immediately wherever she
went. Nynaeve, as expected, wore stout Two Rivers woolens, dark and
plain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Success?&rdquo; Egwene said hopefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet, but we will.&rdquo; Elayne sounded so optimistic
that Egwene almost stared; she had to really try to sound that
way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it will not be much longer,&rdquo; Nynaeve
said, sounding even more positive. They must be beating their heads
against a wall.</p>

<p>Egwene sighed. &ldquo;Maybe you should join me again.
I&rsquo;m sure you could find the bowl in a few more days, but I
keep thinking about all these stories.&rdquo; They could take care of
themselves. She knew that, and it would be a fine thought to have
over their graves. Siuan said that <em>none</em> of the stories
they had told were exaggerations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Egwene,&rdquo; Nynaeve protested. &ldquo;The bowl is too
important. You know it is. Everything is going to cook in its own
juice if we don&rsquo;t find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; Elayne added, &ldquo;what kind of trouble can we
fall into? We sleep every night in the Tarasin Palace, in case
you&rsquo;ve forgotten, and if Tylin doesn&rsquo;t tuck us in, she is
still there to talk.&rdquo; Her dress was different, the cut unaltered,
but the material was coarse and worn. Nynaeve wore a near copy of
it, except that her knife had no more than nine or ten glass beads
on the hilt. Hardly clothes for any palace. Worse, she was trying
to look innocent. Nynaeve had no practice at that.</p>

<p>Egwene let it pass. The bowl <em>was</em> important,
they <em>could</em> take care of themselves, and she knew very well
they were not looking in the Tarasin Palace. She almost let it
pass, anyway. &ldquo;You are making use of Mat, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;&rdquo; Abruptly Elayne became aware of her
dress and gave a start. For some reason, though, it seemed to be
the small knife that truly startled her. Eyes popping, she clutched
the hilt, a mass of large red and white glass beads, and her face
went absolutely crimson. An instant later she was in a high-necked
Andoran gown of green silk.</p>

<p>The funny thing was, Nynaeve realized what she was
wearing only a heartbeat behind Elayne, and reacted exactly the
same. Exactly. Except maybe that if Elayne blushed like a sunset,
Nynaeve blushed for two. She was back into Two Rivers woolens even
before Elayne changed.</p>

<p>Clearing her throat, Elayne said breathily, &ldquo;Mat is
quite useful, I&rsquo;m sure, but we cannot allow him to get in our
way, Egwene. You know how he is. You can be sure, though, if we do
anything dangerous, we will have him and all his soldiers cheek to
cheek around us.&rdquo; Nynaeve was silent, and looking sour. Perhaps
remembering Mat&rsquo;s threat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve, you won&rsquo;t push at Mat too hard, will
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne laughed. &ldquo;Egwene, she is not pushing at him at
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the simple truth,&rdquo; Nynaeve put in
quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not said a cross word to him since we arrived
in Ebou Dar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene nodded doubtfully. She could reach the bottom
of this, but it would take&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she glanced down to make sure the
stole had not reappeared, and saw only a flicker that even she
could not recognize.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egwene,&rdquo; Elayne said, &ldquo;have you been able to speak
with the dreamwalkers yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;Do they know what the problem
is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have.&rdquo; Egwene sighed. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t, not
really.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It had been an odd meeting, only a few days ago,
begun by finding Bair&rsquo;s dreams. Bair and Melaine had met her
in the Stone of Tear; Amys had said she would not teach Egwene
more, and she did not come. At first, Egwene felt awkward. She
could not bring herself to tell them she was Aes Sedai, much less
Amyrlin, afraid they might believe it another lie. There had
certainly been no difficulty with the stole appearing then. And
then there was her <em>toh</em> to Melaine. She brought it up,
thinking all the while about how many miles she had to spend in a
saddle the next day, but Melaine was so full of pleasure that she
was going to have daughters&mdash;she rhapsodized over Min&rsquo;s
viewing&mdash;that she not only announced straight away that
Egwene had no <em>toh</em> toward her, but said she was going to
name one of the girls Egwene. That had been a small pleasure in a
night full of futility and irritation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What they said,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;was that they had
never heard of anyone trying to find something with need again
after they had already found it. Bair thought maybe it was like
trying to eat the same&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;apple twice.&rdquo; The same <em>motai</em>
was what Bair had said; a <em>motai</em> was a kind of grub found
in the Waste. Quite sweet and crunchy&mdash;until Egwene found out
what she was eating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean we just <em>can&rsquo;t</em> go back to the
storeroom?&rdquo; Elayne sighed. &ldquo;I was hoping we were doing something
wrong. Oh, well. We&rsquo;ll find it anyway.&rdquo; She hesitated, and her
dress changed again, though she did not seem to notice. It was
still Andoran, but red, with the White Lions of Andor climbing the
sleeves and marching across the bodice. A queen&rsquo;s dress, even
without the Rose Crown resting on her red-gold curls. But a
queen&rsquo;s dress with a close-fitting bodice that showed perhaps
more cleavage than an Andoran queen would. &ldquo;Egwene, did they say
anything about Rand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in Cairhien, lolling about in the Sun
Palace, it seems.&rdquo; Egwene managed to not wince. Neither Bair nor
Melaine had been very forthcoming, but Melaine muttered darkly
about Aes Sedai while Bair said that they should all be beaten at
regular intervals; whatever Sorilea said, a simple beating should
be enough. Egwene was very much afraid that somehow Merana had
managed to put a foot very wrong. At least he was putting
Elaida&rsquo;s emissaries off; she did not think he knew how to
handle them nearly as well as he thought he did. &ldquo;Perrin is with
him. And Perrin&rsquo;s wife! He married Faile!&rdquo; That brought
exclamations; Nynaeve said Faile was much too good for him, but
said it smiling broadly; Elayne said she hoped they would be happy,
but she sounded doubtful for some reason. &ldquo;Loial is there, too. And
Min. All it needs is Mat and the three of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne bit her underlip. &ldquo;Egwene, would you pass a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a message to the Wise Ones for Min? Tell her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She
hesitated, chewing her lip in thought. &ldquo;Tell her I hope she can
come to like Aviendha as much as she likes me. I know that sounds
odd,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a private matter between us.&rdquo; Nynaeve
looked at Elayne as oddly as Egwene knew she herself was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will, of course. I don&rsquo;t mean to talk with
them again for some time, though.&rdquo; There was not much point
when they were as uncommunicative concerning Rand as they were. And
as hostile toward Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is fine,&rdquo; Elayne said quickly. &ldquo;It really
isn&rsquo;t important. Well, if we can&rsquo;t use need, then we must
use feet, and in Ebou Dar, mine are aching right now. If you
don&rsquo;t mind, I will go back to my body and get some real
sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go ahead,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;I will be just a
little while.&rdquo; When Elayne vanished, she turned to Egwene. Her
dress had changed too, and Egwene thought she knew very well why.
It was a soft blue, cut low. There were flowers in her hair, and
ribbons through her braid, as there would be for her wedding back
home. Egwene&rsquo;s heart went out to her. &ldquo;Have you heard anything
of Lan?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Nynaeve, I haven&rsquo;t. I am so sorry; I wish I
could tell you better. I know he&rsquo;s still alive, Nynaeve. And I
know he loves you as much as you love him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he is alive,&rdquo; Nynaeve said firmly. &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t allow anything else. I mean to make him mine. He is
mine, and I won&rsquo;t let him be dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Egwene woke herself, Siuan was sitting beside
her cot, dimly seen in the darkness. &ldquo;Is it done?&rdquo; Egwene
asked.</p>

<p>The glow surrounded Siuan as she wove a small ward
against eavesdropping around the pair of them. &ldquo;Of the six sisters
on duty beginning at midnight, only three have Warders, and those
Gaidin will be on guard outside. They will have mint tea brought to
them, with a small addition they shouldn&rsquo;t taste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene closed her eyes for a moment. &ldquo;Am I doing the
right thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ask <em>me</em>?&rdquo; Siuan choked out. &ldquo;I did as I
was commanded, Mother. I&rsquo;d as soon jump into a school of
feeding silverpike as help that man escape if it were up to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will gentle him, Siuan.&rdquo; Egwene had been over
this with her, but she needed to go over it again for herself, to
convince herself she was not making a mistake. &ldquo;Even Sheriam
doesn&rsquo;t listen to Carlinya anymore, and Lelaine and Romanda
are pressing for it. That or someone really will do what Delana has
been hinting at. I won&rsquo;t allow murder! If we cannot try a man
and execute him, we have no right to <em>arrange</em> for him to
die. I will not let him be murdered, and I cannot allow him to be
gentled. If Merana really has put Rand&rsquo;s back up somehow, that
will be tossing fat-wood in the fire. I just wish I could be sure
he will go to Rand and join him instead of running off the Light
knows where, doing the Light knows what. At least that way there
might be some way to control what he does.&rdquo; She heard Siuan shift
in the darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always thought the stole weighed about as much as
three good men,&rdquo; Siuan said quietly. &ldquo;The Amyrlin has few easy
decisions to make, and fewer where she can be sure. Do what you
must, and pay the price if you&rsquo;re wrong. Sometimes if you are
right, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene laughed softly. &ldquo;It does seem to me I have
heard that before.&rdquo; After a while her mirth died. &ldquo;Make sure he
doesn&rsquo;t hurt anyone leaving, Siuan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you command, Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop"> &ldquo;This is terrible,&rdquo; Nisao muttered. &ldquo;If it becomes
known, the condemnation will be enough to drive you into exile,
Myrelle. And me with you. Four hundred years ago, it might have
been commonplace, but no one will think it so today. Some will call
it crime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Myrelle was glad the moon was down already. It hid
her grimace. She could handle the Healing herself, but Nisao had
been studying how to deal with sicknesses of the mind, things the
Power could not touch. Myrelle was not sure this counted as a
sickness, but she would try whatever tool might work. Nisao could
say what she would; Myrelle knew she would cut off her own hand
rather than pass up this chance to further her studies.</p>

<p>She could feel him out there in the night, coming
closer. They were well away from the tents, well beyond the
soldiers, with only scattered trees round them. She had felt him
from the moment his bond passed to her, the crime Nisao fretted
over. A Warder&rsquo;s bond passed from one Aes Sedai to another
without his consent. Nisao was right in one point; they would have
to keep this secret as long as they could. Myrelle could feel his
wounds, some almost healed, some almost fresh. Some badly infected.
He would not have gone aside to seek battle. He had to come to her,
as surely as a boulder tipped down a mountain had to roll on to the
bottom. He would not have moved one foot to stand aside from battle
either. She had felt his journey in distance and blood; his blood.
Across Cairhien and Andor, Murandy and now Altara, through lands
infested with rebels and rogues, bandits and Dragonsworn, focused
on her like an arrow speeding to the target, carving his way
through any armed man who stood in his path. Even he could not do
that unharmed. She toted up his injuries in her mind, and wondered
that he was still alive.</p>

<p>The sound of a horse&rsquo;s hooves came to her first,
a steady walk, and only then did she make out the tall black
warhorse in the night. Night seemed to be the rider, too. He would
be wearing his cloak. The horse stopped a good fifty paces from
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have sent Nuhel and Croi out to
find me,&rdquo; the unseen rider called in a rough voice. &ldquo;I almost
killed them before I saw who they were. Avar, you might as well
come out from behind that tree.&rdquo; Off to the right, the night seemed
to move; Avar wore his cloak too, and he would not have expected to
be seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is madness,&rdquo; Nisao muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; Myrelle hissed. In a louder voice, she
called, &ldquo;Come to me.&rdquo; The horse did not move. A wolfhound mourning
his dead mistress did not come to a new mistress willingly.
Delicately she wove Spirit and touched the part of him that
contained her bond; it had to be delicate, or he would be aware of
it, and only the Creator knew what sort of explosion might result.
 &ldquo;Come to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time the horse came forward, and the man swung
down to stride the last paces, a tall man, moonshadows making his
angular face seemed carved of stone. Then he was standing in front
of her, standing over her, and as she stared up into Lan
Mandragoran&rsquo;s cold blue eyes, she saw death. The Light help
her. How was she ever to keep him alive long enough?</p>
