have to help me talk some sense into them,&rdquo; Mat
said around his pipestem. &ldquo;Thom, are you listening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were seated on upended kegs in the scant shade
of a two-story house, smoking their pipes, and the lanky old
gleeman seemed more interested in staring at the letter Rand had
sent on to him. Now he stuffed it into his coat pocket with the
tree-and-crown seal yet unbroken. The buzz of voices and squeak of
axles from the street at the end of the alley seemed distant. Sweat
dripped from both their faces. At least one thing was taken care of
for the moment. Mat had come out of the Little Tower to find that a
group of Aes Sedai had hauled Aviendha away somewhere; she would
not be sticking a knife in anybody any time soon.</p>

<p>Thom took his pipe from his mouth. It was a
long-stemmed thing, carved all over with oak leaves and acorns. &ldquo;I
once tried to rescue a woman, Mat. Laritha was a rose in bud, and
married to a glowering brute of a bootmaker in a village where I
broke my journey for a few days. A brute. He shouted at her if
dinner wasn&rsquo;t ready when he wanted to sit down, and took a
switch to her if he saw her say more than two words to another
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thom, what in the Pit of Doom does this have to do
with making those fool women see sense?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just listen, boy. How he treated her was common
knowledge in the village, but Laritha told me herself, all the
while moaning over how she wished someone would rescue her. I had
gold in my purse and a fine coach, a driver and a manservant. I was
young and good-looking.&rdquo; Thom knuckled his white mustaches and
sighed; it was hard to believe that leathery face had ever been
good-looking. Mat blinked. A coach? When had a gleeman ever had a
coach? &ldquo;Mat, the woman&rsquo;s plight wrung my heart. And I
won&rsquo;t deny her face tugged at it, too. As I said, I was young;
I thought I was in love, a hero out of the stories. So one day,
sitting beneath a flowering apple tree&mdash;well away from the
bootmaker&rsquo;s house&mdash;I offered to take her away. I&rsquo;d
give her a maid and a house of her own, and court her with songs
and verse. When she finally understood, she kicked me in the knee
so hard I limped for a month, and hit me with the bench
besides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They all seem to like kicking,&rdquo; Mat muttered,
shifting his weight on the keg. &ldquo;I suppose she didn&rsquo;t believe
you, and who can blame her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she believed. And was outraged that I thought
she would ever leave her beloved husband. Her word; beloved. She
ran back to the man as fast as her feet would go, and I had the
choice of killing him or leaping into my coach. I had to leave
behind almost every stitch I owned. I expect she&rsquo;s still
living with him much as before. Holding the purse strings tight in
her fist and cracking his head open with whatever lies to hand
every time he stops into the inn for an ale. As she always had, so
I learned later from a few discreet inquiries.&rdquo; He stuck the pipe
back between his teeth as if he had made a point.</p>

<p>Mat scratched his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what that
has to do with this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just that you shouldn&rsquo;t think you know the
whole story when you&rsquo;ve heard part. For instance, do you know
Elayne and Nynaeve will be leaving for Ebou Dar in a day or so?
Juilin and I are to go along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ebou&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo; Mat barely caught his pipe before it
fell into the dead weeds that carpeted the alley. Nalesean had told
some stories about a visit to Ebou Dar, and even counting in the
way he exaggerated when it came to women he had known and fights he
had been in, the place sounded rough. So they thought they could
slip Elayne away from him, did they? &ldquo;Thom, you have to help me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Thom broke in. &ldquo;Steal them away from the
bootmaker?&rdquo; He blew up a streamer of blue smoke. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do
that, boy. You still don&rsquo;t know the whole story. How do you
feel about Egwene and Nynaeve? On second thought, make that just
Egwene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat frowned, wondering whether the man thought he
could fuddle everything up by going around in circles long enough.
 &ldquo;I like Egwene. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;burn me, Thom, she&rsquo;s Egwene;
that&rsquo;s saying enough right there. That&rsquo;s why I am trying
to save her fool neck for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Save her from her bootmaker, you mean,&rdquo; Thom
murmured, but Mat went right on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her neck and Elayne&rsquo;s as well; even
Nynaeve&rsquo;s, if I can stop from throttling her myself. Light! I
only want to help them. Besides, Rand will break <em>my</em> neck
if I let anything happen to Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever thought of helping them do what they
want instead of what you want? If I did what I wanted, I&rsquo;d
have Elayne on a horse and riding to Andor. She needs to do other
things&mdash;<em>needs</em> to, I think&mdash;so I trot around
after her, sweating day and night that somebody will manage to kill
her before I can prevent it. She will go to Caemlyn when she&rsquo;s
ready.&rdquo; He sucked at his pipe complacently, but there was a slight
edge to his voice at the end, as if he did not like his words even
as much as he pretended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me they want to hand their heads to
Elaida.&rdquo; So Thom would have that silly wench on a horse, would he?
A gleeman hauling the Daughter-Heir off to be crowned! He did have
a grand sense of himself, Thom did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t a fool, Mat,&rdquo; Thom said quietly.
 &ldquo;You know better. Egwene&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it&rsquo;s hard to think of that
child as Amyrlin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Mat grunted sourly in agreement; Thom paid
him no mind. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;yet I believe she has the backbone for it.
It&rsquo;s too early to say whether a few things are just
happenstance, but I&rsquo;m beginning to believe she may have the
brains as well. The question is, is she tough enough? If she lacks
that, they will eat her alive&mdash;backbone, brains and all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who will? Elaida?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, her. If she has the chance; that one lacks
nothing for toughness. But the Aes Sedai right here hardly think of
Egwene as Aes Sedai; Amyrlin maybe, but not Aes Sedai, hard as that
is to believe.&rdquo; Thom shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand, but
it&rsquo;s true. The same for Elayne and Nynaeve. They try to keep
it among themselves, but even Aes Sedai don&rsquo;t hide as much as
they think, if you watch close and keep your wits about you.&rdquo; He
pulled out that letter again, just turning it over in his hands
without looking at it. &ldquo;Egwene is walking the edge of a precipice,
Mat, and three factions right here in Salidar&mdash;three that
I&rsquo;m sure of&mdash;might push her over if she makes one wrong
step. Elayne will follow if that happens, and Nynaeve. Or maybe
they&rsquo;ll push them over first to pull her down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right here in Salidar,&rdquo; Mat said, flat as a planed
board. Thom nodded calmly; and Mat could not stop his voice from
rising. &ldquo;And you want me to leave them here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to stop thinking you&rsquo;re going to
<em>make</em> them do anything. They&rsquo;ve decided what they are
going to do, and you can&rsquo;t change it. But maybe&mdash;just
maybe&mdash;you can help me keep them alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat jumped to his feet. In his head was an image of a
woman with a knife stuck between her breasts; not one of the
borrowed memories. He kicked the keg he had been sitting on,
sending it rolling along the alley. Help a <em>gleeman</em> keep
them alive? A faint memory stirred, something about Basel Gill, an
innkeeper in Caemlyn, saying something about Thom, but it was like
mist, gone as soon as he tried to hold it. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the letter
from, Thom? Another woman you rescued? Or did you leave her where
she could get her head cut off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I left her,&rdquo; Thom said softly. Rising, he walked
away without another word.</p>

<p>Mat half reached out to stop him, started to speak.
Only he could not think of what to say. <em>Crazy old man!</em> No,
he was not crazy. Egwene was mule stubborn, and Nynaeve made her
look biddable. Worse, either would climb a tree to see the
lightning better. As for Elayne, noblewomen never had enough sense
to come in out of the rain. And then they were indignant when they
got wet.</p>

<p>Tapping out his pipe, he crushed the embers under
heel before the dry weeds could catch, then caught up his hat from
the ground and limped out to the street. He needed information from
a better source than a gleeman who had delusions of grandeur from
running around with that stuck-up chit of a Daughter-Heir. Down to
his left he saw Nynaeve coming out of the Little Tower and started
toward her, winding between loaded carts drawn by oxen or horses.
She could tell him what he needed to know. If she would. His hip
gave him a twinge. <em>Burn me, she owes me a few answers</em>.</p>

<p>Just then Nynaeve caught sight of him and stiffened
visibly. For a moment she watched him approach, then abruptly
hurried off in the other direction, plainly trying to avoid him.
She looked over her shoulder twice before people and carts hid
her.</p>

<p>He stopped, scowling, and pulled his hat low. First
the woman kicked him for no reason; now she would not talk to him.
They meant to let him stew, her and Egwene, until he would trot off
meekly when they pointed a finger. <em>Well, they chose the wrong
man for their game, burn their hides!</em></p>

<p>Vanin and the others were outside a stable beside a
stone building that had surely been an inn once. Aes Sedai streamed
in and out of it now. Pips and the rest of their horses were tied
to a hitching rail, and Vanin and the two scouts who had been
captured were squatting against the wall. Mar and Ladwin were as
different as men could be, one tall, lanky and rough-faced, the
other short, stocky and mild-seeming, but both looked plain
embarrassed when Mat walked up. Neither had gotten over the ease of
his capture. The two squadmen stood stiffly, still holding the
banners tight against their staffs as if there was any point to it
now. They looked more than a little apprehensive. A battle was one
thing; all these Aes Sedai were quite another. A man had a chance
in battle. There were two Warders watching them. Not openly, and
from across the stableyard, but they had not just picked that spot,
standing in the full sun, to talk.</p>

<p>Mat stroked Pips&rsquo; nose, then after a moment
began to examine the horse&rsquo;s eyes. A fellow in a leather vest
came out of the stable, shoving a dung barrow up the street. Vanin
walked over to peer into Pips&rsquo; eye. Not looking at him, Mat
said, &ldquo;Could you reach the Band?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; Vanin frowned and lifted Pips&rsquo; eyelid.
 &ldquo;With a little luck, maybe. Hate to leave my horse, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat nodded, looking closer at the eye. &ldquo;Tell Talmanes
I said to sit tight. I may be staying here a few days, and I
don&rsquo;t want any bloody attempted rescue. Try to make it back
here. Without being seen, if you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vanin spat into the dust under Pips. &ldquo;Man mixes with
Aes Sedai, he&rsquo;s bridled himself and put a saddle on his back.
I&rsquo;ll be back when I can.&rdquo; Shaking his head, he strolled off
into the crowd, a fat rumpled man with a rolling walk who no one
could suspect of being able to sneak.</p>

<p>One of the squadmen cleared his throat hesitantly and
stepped closer. &ldquo;My Lord, is everything&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? This is what you
planned, isn&rsquo;t it, my Lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right to the plan, Verdin,&rdquo; Mat said, patting Pips.
He was headfirst in a sack, and the strings tied tight. He had
promised Rand to see Elayne safe to Caemlyn, and he could not leave
without her. And he could not go off and let Egwene stretch her
neck on the chopping block, either. It might be&mdash;Light, how
it rankled!&mdash;it might be that he was going to have to take
Thom&rsquo;s advice. Try to keep those bloody women&rsquo;s bloody
heads on their bloody shoulders by somehow helping them make this
whole mad impossible scheme actually work. While trying to keep his
own neck in one piece, incidentally. And that left out keeping
Aviendha from Elayne&rsquo;s throat. Well, at the least, he could be
around to get them away when it all fell apart. Small comfort that
was. &ldquo;Everything is just bloody fine.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Elayne expected to find Aviendha in the waiting room
or maybe outside, but she hardly had to listen to discover why she
was in neither place; There were two topics of conversation among
the other Aes Sedai, and everyone was talking, with papers lying
abandoned on the tables. Mat occupied most tongues; even the
servants and novices bustling about the waiting room paused in
running errands to exchange words about him. He was <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em>. Was it safe to let a <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>
remain in Salidar? Had he really been in the Tower and simply
allowed to go? Was it true he commanded the Dragonsworn army? Was
he to be arrested for the atrocities they had heard of? Was it true
he came from the same village as the Dragon Reborn and the Amyrlin?
There were rumors of two to <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> connected to the
Dragon Reborn; who was the second, and where could he be found?
Maybe Mat Cauthon knew. There seemed to be as many opinions as
there were people to give them.</p>

<p>There were two questions Elayne expected to hear and
did not. What did Mat want in Salidar, and how had Rand known where
to send him? Nobody asked them, but here an Aes Sedai suddenly
shifted her shawl as if cold or gave a start when she realized
someone had spoken to her, there a serving woman stared at nothing
in the middle of the floor before coming to herself with a shake or
a novice darted frightened glances at the sisters. Mat was not
quite a cat set among the pigeons, but he came close. Just the fact
that Rand knew where they were seemed enough to set a chill.</p>

<p>Aviendha occasioned less comment, but the sisters
could not help talking about her, and not only to change the
subject. It was not every day that a wilder simply appeared on her
own two feet, especially with such remarkable strength, and an Aiel
besides. That last truly fascinated every sister. No Aiel had ever
trained in the Tower, and few Aes Sedai had ever entered the Aiel
Waste.</p>

<p>A single question sufficed to learn where she was
being held. Not held in name, but Elayne knew how Aes Sedai could
be when they wanted a woman to become a novice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will be in white by nightfall,&rdquo; Akarrin said
confidently. A slim Brown, she nodded for emphasis with almost
every word. The two sisters with her nodded just as surely.</p>

<p><em>Tsk</em>ing under her breath, Elayne hurried into
the street. Ahead of her she could see Nynaeve practically
trotting, and looking over her shoulder so often that she was
running into people. Elayne thought about catching up&mdash;she
would not mind having company&mdash;but she was not about to run
in this heat, concentration or no, and that seemed the only way.
Even so, she did lift her skirts slightly and hurried.</p>

<p>Before she had gone fifty paces, she felt Birgitte
coming closer and turned to see her running down the street. Areina
was with her, but she stopped a little way off and folded her arms
with a scowl. The woman was an impossible little wretch, and she
certainly had not changed her opinions because Elayne really was
Aes Sedai now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you should know,&rdquo; Birgitte said quietly.
 &ldquo;I just heard that when we leave for Ebou Dar, Vandene and Adeleas
are going too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Elayne murmured. It could be that the pair
were going to join Merilille for some reason, though there were
already three Aes Sedai at Tylin&rsquo;s court, or maybe they had a
mission of their own in Ebou Dar. She did not believe either.
Areina had her mind set, and so did the Hall. Elayne and Nynaeve
were to be accompanied by two <em>real</em> Aes Sedai as
chaperones. &ldquo;She <em>does</em> understand <em>she</em> isn&rsquo;t
going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Birgitte glanced the way Elayne was staring, at
Areina, then shrugged. &ldquo;She understands; she is not happy over it.
Myself, I can hardly wait to be gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne hesitated only a moment. She had promised to
keep secrets, which she did not like, but she had not promised to
stop trying to convince the other woman there was no need, and no
point. &ldquo;Birgitte, Egwene&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Elayne had not had Birgitte for a Warder
long before she decided that when she bonded Rand, she would
somehow make him promise to do as he was told, at least when it was
important. Lately she had decided on another provision: he was
going to have to answer her questions. Birgitte answered when she
chose, evaded when she chose and sometimes just put on a stubborn
face, as she did now. &ldquo;Tell me why not, and if it&rsquo;s a good
reason, I&rsquo;ll never ask again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At first Birgitte just glowered, but then she took
Elayne&rsquo;s arm and very nearly hustled her to the mouth of an
alley. No one passing by glanced at them twice, and Areina remained
where she was, if darker of face than before, but Birgitte still
looked around carefully and spoke in a whisper. &ldquo;Always when the
Wheel spun me out, I was born, lived and died without ever knowing
I was bound to the Wheel. I only knew that in between, in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. Sometimes I became known, even
famous, but I was like everyone else, not somebody out of a legend.
This time I was ripped out, not spun out. For the first time
wearing flesh, I know who I am. For the first time, other people
can know too. Thom and Juilin do; they say nothing, but I am sure.
They don&rsquo;t look at me the way they do other people. If I said
I was going to climb a glass mountain and kill a giant with my bare
hands, they&rsquo;d just ask if I needed any help on the way, and
they would not expect me to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Elayne said slowly, and
Birgitte sighed and let her head hang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I can live up to that. In
other lives, I did what I had to, what seemed to be right, enough
for Maerion or Joana or any woman. Now, I&rsquo;m <em>Birgitte</em>
of the stories. Everyone who knows will <em>expect</em>. I feel
like a feather-dancer walking into a Tovan conclave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne did not ask; when Birgitte mentioned things
from past lives, the explanations were usually more confusing than
ignorance. &ldquo;That is nonsense,&rdquo; she said firmly, taking the other
woman by the arms. &ldquo;<em>I</em> know, and <em>I</em> certainly
don&rsquo;t expect you to kill any giants. Egwene doesn&rsquo;t
either. And she <em>already</em> knows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as I don&rsquo;t admit it,&rdquo; Birgitte
muttered, &ldquo;it is as if she didn&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t bother saying
that&rsquo;s nonsense too; I know it is, but that changes
nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what about this? She is the Amyrlin, and you
are a Warder. She deserves your trust, Birgitte. She needs it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you done with her yet?&rdquo; Areina demanded from a
pace away. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to go away and leave me, the least
you can do is help me with my archery the way you said you
would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will think on it,&rdquo; Birgitte told Elayne quietly.
Turning to Areina, she caught the woman&rsquo;s braid at the base of
her neck. &ldquo;We will speak of archery,&rdquo; she said, pushing her up the
street, &ldquo;but first we will speak of manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shaking her head, Elayne suddenly remembered Aviendha
and hurried on. The house was not far.</p>

<p>It took her a moment to recognize Aviendha. Elayne
was used to seeing her in <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em>, with her dark
reddish hair cut short, not in skirt and blouse and shawl with hair
below her shoulders and held back from her face by a folded
kerchief. At first glance, she did not appear to be in any
difficulty. Sitting rather awkwardly in a chair&mdash;Aiel were
unused to chairs&mdash;she seemed to be peacefully sipping tea
with five sisters in a circle in the sitting room. Houses that
sheltered Aes Sedai had such things, though Elayne and Nynaeve were
still in their cramped little room. At second glance, Aviendha was
casting hunted looks at the Aes Sedai over the rim of her teacup.
There was no time for a third glance; on sight of Elayne, Aviendha
jerked to her feet and dropped her cup to the clean-swept floor.
Elayne had seen few Aiel except in the Stone of Tear, but she did
know they hid their emotions, and Aviendha did it very well. Only
now naked pain painted her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Elayne told the room smoothly, &ldquo;but
I must take her away from you for a little while. Perhaps you can
talk to her later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several of the sisters hesitated on the brink of
protest, though there should have been none. She was clearly the
strongest in the room by far, except for Aviendha, and none of the
Aes Sedai was a Sitter or part of Sheriam&rsquo;s council. She was
very happy that Myrelle was not there, since she lived in this
house. Elayne had made her choice of Green and been accepted, only
to discover that Myrelle was the head of the Green Ajah in Salidar.
Myrelle, who had not even been Aes Sedai fifteen years. From things
that had been said, Elayne knew there were Greens in Salidar who
had worn the shawl at least fifty, though not a one showed a gray
hair. Had Myrelle been there, all Elayne&rsquo;s strength would have
counted nothing if the head of her Ajah wanted to retain Aviendha.
As it was, only Shana, a pop-eyed White who reminded Elayne of a
fish, went as far as opening her mouth further, and she closed it
again, though rather sullenly when Elayne arched an eyebrow at
her.</p>

<p>The five were more than a bit tight-lipped, but
Elayne ignored the tension. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said with a smile she
did not feel.</p>

<p>Aviendha slung a dark bundle on her back, but
hesitated until Elayne actually asked her to come. In the street,
Elayne said, &ldquo;I apologize for that. I&rsquo;ll see it does not
happen again.&rdquo; She could manage that, she was sure. Or Egwene
could, surely. &ldquo;There are not many places to talk alone, I&rsquo;m
afraid. My room is rather hot this time of day. We could try to
find some shade, or have some tea, if they haven&rsquo;t already
filled you with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your room.&rdquo; It was not exactly curt, but plainly
Aviendha did not want to talk, not yet. Abruptly she darted to a
passing cart filled with firewood and snatched out a branch meant
to be broken for kindling, longer than her arm and thicker than her
thumb. Rejoining Elayne, she began peeling it with her belt knife;
the sharp blade shaved away smaller branches like a razor. The pain
was gone from her face. She seemed determined now.</p>

<p>Elayne eyed her sideways as they walked. She would
not believe Aviendha meant her any harm, whatever that lout Mat
Cauthon said. Then again&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she knew a little of <em>
ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>; Aviendha had explained some of it when
they were in the Stone together. Maybe Rand had said or done
something. Maybe that bewildering labyrinth of honor and obligation
required Aviendha to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it did not seem possible. But maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When they reached her room, she decided to bring it
up first. Facing the other woman&mdash;and very deliberately not
embracing <em>saidar</em>&mdash;she said, &ldquo;Mat claims you have
come here to kill me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha blinked. &ldquo;Wetlanders always put everything
backwards,&rdquo; she said wonderingly. Laying the stick on the foot of
Nynaeve&rsquo;s bed, she put the belt knife beside it carefully. &ldquo;My
near-sister Egwene asked me to watch Rand al&rsquo;Thor for you,
which I promised to do.&rdquo; Bundle and shawl went on the floor beside
the door. &ldquo;I have <em>toh</em> toward her, but greater to you.&rdquo;
Unlacing her blouse, she pulled it over her head, then pushed her
shift to her waist. &ldquo;I love Rand al&rsquo;Thor, and once I let
myself lie with him. I have <em>toh</em>, and I ask that you help
me meet it.&rdquo; Turning her back, she knelt in the small space
available. &ldquo;You may use the stick or the knife as you wish; the
<em>toh</em> is mine, but the choice is yours.&rdquo; She tilted up her
chin, stretching her neck. Her eyes were closed. &ldquo;Whichever you
choose, I accept.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne thought her knees were going to buckle. Min
had said the third woman would be dangerous, but Aviendha? <em>
Wait! She said she</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>With Rand!</em> Her hand twitched
toward the knife on the bed, and she folded her arms, trapping her
hands. &ldquo;Get up. And put on your blouse. I am <em>not</em> going to
hit you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Just a few times? She tightened her arms to hold
her hands where they were. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and I am <em>certainly</em> not
going to touch that knife. Please put it away.&rdquo; She would have
handed it to the other woman, but she was not certain she was safe
to touch a weapon right then. &ldquo;You have no <em>toh</em> toward me.&rdquo;
She believed that was the phrase. &ldquo;I love Rand, but I don&rsquo;t
care that you love him too.&rdquo; The lie burned her tongue. Aviendha
had actually <em>lain</em> with him?</p>

<p>Twisting around on her knees, Aviendha frowned. &ldquo;I am
not certain I understand. Are you proposing that we share him?
Elayne, we are friends, I think, but we must be as first-sisters if
we are to be sister-wives. It will take time to know if we can be
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Realizing her mouth was hanging open, Elayne closed
it. &ldquo;I suppose it will,&rdquo; she said faintly. Min kept saying they
would share him, but certainly not that way! Even the thought was
indecent! &ldquo;It is a little more complicated than you know.
There&rsquo;s another woman who loves him, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha was on her feet so fast she simply seemed to
be one place then the other. &ldquo;What is her name?&rdquo; Her green eyes
blazed, and she had the knife in her hand.</p>

<p>Elayne almost laughed. <em>One moment talking about
sharing, the next as fierce as</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>as</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>as
fierce as me</em>, she finished, not at all pleased with the
thought. This could have been worse, much worse. It could have been
Berelain. Since it had to be somebody, it might as well be
Aviendha. <em>And I might as well deal with it instead of kicking
my skirts like a child</em>. Seating herself on the bed, she folded
her hands in her lap. &ldquo;Do sheathe that and sit down, Aviendha. And
please put on your blouse. I have a great deal to tell you. There
is a woman&mdash;my friend, my near-sister&mdash;named Min&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha did clothe herself, but a considerable time
passed before she sat, and considerably more before Elayne could
convince her that they should not combine to do Min in. She agreed
to that, at least. Reluctantly, she finally said, &ldquo;I must get to
know her. I will not share him with a woman I cannot love as a
first-sister.&rdquo; That with a studying look at Elayne, who sighed.</p>

<p>Aviendha would consider sharing him with her. Min was
ready to share him with her. Was she the only one of the three who
was normal? By the map under her mattress, Min should be in Caemlyn
soon, or maybe already was. She did not know what she wanted to
have happen there, only that Min should use her viewings to help
him. Which meant Min had to stay close to him. While Elayne went to
Ebou Dar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is anything in life ever simple, Aviendha?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not when men are involved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne was not sure which surprised her more, to find
that she was laughing or that Aviendha was.</p>
