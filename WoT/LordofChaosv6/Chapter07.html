<h4><em>A Matter of Thought</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">S</span>eated
on her mattress, Elayne finished the one
hundred strokes with her left hand, then put the hairbrush away in
her small leather traveling case and pushed it back under the
narrow bed. A dull ache rested behind her eyes from a day spent
channeling, making <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. Too often <em>
trying</em> to make <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. Nynaeve, balanced
atop their loose-jointed stool, had long since completed brushing
her waist-length hair and was nearly done replaiting her braid
loosely for sleep. Sweat made her face glisten.</p>

<p>Even with the one window open, the small room was
stifling. The moon hung fat in a star-filled black sky. Their stub
of candle provided a fitful glow. Candles and lamp oil were in
short supply in Salidar; no one got more than a scrap of light at
night unless they had to work with pen and ink. The room truly was
cramped, with little space to move around the two short beds. Most
of what they owned was packed away in a pair of battered
brass-bound chests. Accepted&rsquo;s dresses and cloaks they
certainly had no need of now hung from pegs in the walls, where
ragged holes in the crazed yellowing plaster showed the lathing
beneath. A tiny table with a tilt was shoved between the beds, and
a rickety washstand in the corner held a white pitcher and basin
with an amazing number of chips between them. Even Accepted who had
their heads patted at every turn were not indulged.</p>

<p>A handful of bedraggled blue and white wildflowers&mdash;fooled by the weather into blooming late, and not very well&mdash;stuck out of a yellow vase with a broken neck between a pair
of brown pottery cups on the table. The only other spot of color
was a green-striped song sparrow in a wicker cage. Elayne was
nursing it for a broken wing. She had tried her small skill with
Healing on another bird, but songbirds at least were too small to
survive the shock.</p>

<p><em>No complaining</em>, she told herself firmly. Aes
Sedai lived a little better, novices and servants a little worse,
and Gareth Bryne&rsquo;s soldiers slept on the ground most often.
<em>What can&rsquo;t be changed must be endured</em>. Lini used to
say that all the time. Well, Salidar held small enough comfort, and
no luxury. And no coolness, either.</p>

<p>Pulling her shift away from her body, she blew down
her front. &ldquo;We want to be there ahead of them, Nynaeve. You know
how they go on if they have to wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not a breath of breeze stirred, and the parched air
seemed to pull perspiration from every pore. There must be
something that could be done about the weather. Of course, if there
was, Sea Folk Windfinders would probably already have done it, but
she still might think of something, if only the Aes Sedai would
give her time enough away from <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. As
Accepted, she supposedly could take her studies where she wanted,
but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>If they thought I could eat and show them how to
make</em> ter&rsquo;angreal <em>at the same time, I wouldn&rsquo;t
have a minute to myself</em>. At least there would be a break in
that tomorrow.</p>

<p>Shifting to her bed; Nynaeve frowned and fiddled with
the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> bracelet on her wrist. She always insisted
one of them wear it even when they slept, though it produced
decidedly odd and unpleasant dreams. There was hardly need; the
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em> would hold Moghedien just as well hanging on a
peg, and on top of that, she shared a truly tiny cubbyhole with
Birgitte. Birgitte was as good a guard as could be, and besides,
Moghedien almost wept any time Birgitte so much as frowned. She had
the least reason to want Moghedien alive, the most to want her
dead, which the woman knew very well. Tonight the bracelet would be
less use than usual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve, they&rsquo;ll be <em>waiting</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve sniffed loudly&mdash;she did not do well
being at anyone&rsquo;s beck and call&mdash;but she took one of two
flattened stone rings from the table between the beds. Both too
large for a finger, one was striped and flecked blue and brown, the
other blue and red, and each was twisted so it had only one edge.
Unfastening the leather thong hanging around her neck, Nynaeve
threaded the blue-and-brown ring alongside another, heavy and gold.
Lan&rsquo;s signet. She touched the thick gold band tenderly before
tucking both inside her shift.</p>

<p>Elayne picked up the blue-and-red ring, frowning at
it.</p>

<p>The rings were <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> she had made
in imitation of one now in Siuan&rsquo;s possession, and despite
their simple appearance, they were complex beyond belief. Sleeping
with one next to your skin would take you into <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, the World of Dreams, a reflection of
the real world. Perhaps of all worlds; some Aes Sedai claimed that
there were many worlds, as if all variations of the Pattern had to
exist, and that all those worlds together made up a still larger
Pattern. The important thing was that <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> reflected this world, and had
properties that were extremely useful. Especially since the Tower
knew nothing of entering it, so far as they could discover.</p>

<p>Neither of these rings worked quite as well as the
original, though they did work. Elayne was getting a little better
at that; of four attempts to produce a copy, only one had been a
failure. A <em>much</em> better average than with the things she
made from scratch. But what if one of her failures did worse than
simply not work, or not work very well? Aes Sedai had been stilled
studying <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. Burned out, it was called when
it happened by accident, yet it was just as final. Nynaeve did not
think so, of course, but Nynaeve would not be satisfied till she
Healed somebody three days dead.</p>

<p>Elayne turned the ring in her fingers. What it did
was simple enough to understand, but the &ldquo;how&rdquo; still escaped her.
 &ldquo;How?&rdquo; and &ldquo;why?&rdquo; were the keys. With the rings she thought the
pattern of colors had as much to do with it as the shape&mdash;anything other than the twisted ring did nothing, and the one that
had turned out solid blue just gave you horrific nightmares&mdash;but she was not sure how to reproduce the original&rsquo;s red, blue
and brown. Yet the fine structure of her copies was the same, the
way the tiniest bits of them, too small to see or even detect
without the One Power, were arranged. Why should the <em>
colors</em> matter? There seemed to be one common thread in those
tiny structures for <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> that required
channeling to work, and another for those that simply made use of
the Power&mdash;stumbling on that was what allowed her to even
attempt to make original <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>&mdash;but there
was so much she did not know, so much she was guessing at.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to sit there all night?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked
dryly, and Elayne gave a start. Setting one of the pottery cups
back on the table, Nynaeve arranged herself on her bed, hands
folded across her middle. &ldquo;You <em>were</em> the one who mentioned
not keeping them waiting. For myself, I don&rsquo;t mean to give
those biddies an excuse to chew my tail-feathers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hastily Elayne slipped the speckled ring&mdash;it
was not really stone anymore, though it had started out that way&mdash;onto a cord that she tied around her own neck. The second
pottery cup also held a tincture of herbs that Nynaeve had
prepared, slightly sweetened with honey to negate a bitter taste.
Elayne drank about half, from past experience enough to help her
sleep even with a headache. Tonight was one of those nights she
could not afford to dally.</p>

<p>Stretching out on the cramped bed, she channeled
briefly to extinguish the candle, then flapped her shift to produce
a little cool. Well, a stir in the air, anyway. &ldquo;I wish Egwene
would get better. I am tired of the scraps Sheriam and the rest of
them toss us. I want to know what is happening!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had touched on a hazardous topic, she realized.
Egwene had been injured a month and a half ago in Cairhien, on the
day Moiraine and Lanfear died. The day Lan vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Wise Ones say she <em>is</em> getting better,&rdquo;
Nynaeve murmured sleepily in the dark. For once she did not sound
as if she had followed the path to Lan. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Sheriam
and her little circle say, and they have no reason to lie even if
they could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I wish I could look over Sheriam&rsquo;s
shoulder tomorrow night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As well wish&mdash;&rdquo; Nynaeve stopped for a yawn.
 &ldquo;As well wish the Hall will choose you Amyrlin while you&rsquo;re
about it. You might have that one, granted. By the time they choose
anyone, we&rsquo;ll both be gray-haired enough for the job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne opened her mouth to reply, but with the other
woman&rsquo;s example, it turned into a yawn too. Nynaeve began to
snore, not loudly, but with dogged persistence. Elayne let her eyes
drift shut, but her thoughts tried to remain focused in spite of
herself.</p>

<p>The Hall certainly was being dilatory, the Sitters
meeting for less than an hour some days and often not at all. To
talk to one, you would think she saw no urgency, though of course
the Sitters for the six Ajahs&mdash;there were no Reds in Salidar,
of course&mdash;did not tell other Aes Sedai what they discussed
in session, much less an Accepted. They certainly had cause for
dispatch. If their intentions remained secret, their gathering
surely no longer did. Elaida and the Tower would not ignore them
forever. Beyond that, the Whitecloaks were still only a few miles
away in Amadicia, and rumors had begun of Dragonsworn right here in
Altara. The Light alone knew what Dragonsworn might get up to if
Rand had no control over them. The Prophet was a good example&mdash;or rather a horrid one. Riots, homes and farms burned,
people murdered for not showing enough fervor in support of the
Dragon Reborn.</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s snoring sounded like cloth ripping,
but in the distance. Another yawn cracked Elayne&rsquo;s jaws; she
turned on her side and snuggled into the thin pillow. Reasons for
dispatch. Sammael sat in Illian, and it was only a few hundred
miles to the Illianer border, far too close with one of the
Forsaken. The Light alone knew where the other Forsaken were, or
what they were scheming. And Rand; they had to be concerned about
Rand. He was not a danger, of course. He could never be that. But
he <em>was</em> the key to everything; the world truly did bend
itself around him now. She <em>would</em> bond him, somehow. Min.
She and the embassy had to be more than halfway to Caemlyn by now.
No snows to slow them. Another month yet for them to arrive. Not
that she was concerned about Min going to Rand. What was the girl
thinking of? Min. Sleep slid over her, and she slid into <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and found herself standing in the main street
of silent night-shrouded Salidar, with the moon gibbous overhead.
She could see quite clearly, more so than moonlight alone would
have allowed. There was always a sense of light in the World of
Dreams, from everywhere and nowhere, as if the darkness itself had
some dark glow. But then, dreams were like that, and this was a
dream, if not any ordinary dream.</p>

<p>The village here reflected the real Salidar, but in
strange facsimile, more still than even night would make it. Every
window was dark, and an air of emptiness hung heavily, as if no one
occupied any of the buildings. Of course, no one did, here. A
nightbird&rsquo;s reedy cry was answered by another, then a third,
and something made a faint rustling noise as it skittered away in
the odd half-light, but the stables would be empty, and the picket
lines outside the village, and the clearings where sheep and cattle
had been gathered. Wild creatures there would be in plenty, but
none domesticated. Details changed between one glance and the next;
the thatch-roofed buildings remained the same, yet a water barrel
would be in a slightly different place, or gone, a door that had
stood open was closed. The more ephemeral a thing was in the real
world, the more its position or condition might change, the less
firm its reflection.</p>

<p>Occasionally motion flickered in the dark street,
someone appearing and vanishing after a few steps, or even floating
across the ground as if flying. Many people&rsquo;s dreams could
touch <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, but only briefly. Which
was lucky for them. Another property of the World of Dreams was
that what happened to you here was still real when you woke. If you
died here, you did not wake. A strange reflection. Only the heat
was the same.</p>

<p>Nynaeve stood there in an Accepted&rsquo;s white dress
with the banded hem, impatient beside Siuan and Leane. She had the
silver bracelet, too, though it would not work from here to the
waking world; it still held Moghedien, but Nynaeve, out of her
body, would not be feeling anything through it. Leane was regally
slim, though in Elayne&rsquo;s opinion her barely opaque Domani gown
of thin silk detracted from her elegance. The color kept shifting,
too; that sort of thing happened until you learned what you were
doing here. Siuan was better. She wore a simple dress of blue silk,
with a scooped neck just low enough to show the twisted ring on a
necklace. On the other hand, lace trim sometimes appeared on the
dress and the necklace changed from a plain silver chain to
elaborate pieces with rubies or firedrops or emeralds set in gold,
with earrings to match, then back to the plain chain.</p>

<p>That was the original ring hanging around
Siuan&rsquo;s neck; she appeared as solid as any of the buildings.
To herself, Elayne looked just as solid, but she knew that to the
others she seemed slightly misty, like Nynaeve and Leane. You
almost thought you might see the moonlight through them. That was
what using a copy did. She could sense the True Source, but as she
was, <em>saidar</em> felt tenuous; if she tried to channel, that
would be meager too. With the ring Siuan wore, it would not be so,
but that was the price of having secrets someone else knew and you
did not dare have exposed. Siuan trusted the original more than
Elayne&rsquo;s copies, so she wore it&mdash;or sometimes Leane did&mdash;while Elayne and Nynaeve, who could use <em>saidar</em>,
made do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; Siuan demanded. Her neckline
swooped up and down. The dress was green, now, the necklace a
strand of fat moonstones. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough they want to stick
an oar into my work and row as they please; now they make me
wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know why it upsets you for them to come
along,&rdquo; Leane told her. &ldquo;You like watching them make mistakes. They
do not know half of what they think they do.&rdquo; For a moment her gown
slid dangerously close to transparency; a close torque of fat
pearls appeared around her neck and vanished. She did not notice.
She had even less experience here than Siuan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need some real sleep,&rdquo; Siuan muttered. &ldquo;Bryne
tries to run me breathless. But I have to wait on the pleasure of
women who&rsquo;ll spend half the night remembering how to walk. Not
to mention being lumbered with these two.&rdquo; She frowned at Elayne
and Nynaeve, then rolled her eyes skyward.</p>

<p>Nynaeve gripped her braid firmly, a sure indication
of temper working. For once, Elayne agreed with her wholeheartedly.
It was more than difficult being a teacher with pupils who thought
they knew more than they did and were far more likely to call down
the teacher than the teacher was to get away with calling them
down. Of course, the others were far worse than Siuan or Leane.
Where <em>were</em> the others?</p>

<p>Movement appeared up the street. Six women,
surrounded by the glow of <em>saidar</em>, who did not vanish. As
usual, Sheriam and the rest of her council had dreamed themselves
into their own bedchambers and walked out. Elayne was not sure how
far they understood the attributes of <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> yet. In any case, they often insisted
on doing things their own way even when there was a better. Who
could know better than an Aes Sedai?</p>

<p>The six Aes Sedai truly were beginners in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, and their dresses changed every time
Elayne looked at them. First one was wearing the embroidered Aes
Sedai shawl, fringed in the color of her Ajah and with the white
Flame of Tar Valon a bold teardrop on the back, then four were,
then none. Sometimes it was a light traveling cloak, as to keep
dust off, with the Flame on back and left breast. Their ageless
faces showed no signs of the heat, of course&mdash;Aes Sedai never
did&mdash;and no sign they were aware of how their clothes were
changing, either.</p>

<p>They were as misty as Nynaeve or Leane. Sheriam and
the others put more faith in dream <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> that
required channeling than in the rings. They just did not seem
willing to believe that <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> had
nothing to do with the One Power. At least Elayne could not tell
which were using her copies. Somewhere about them three would have
a small disc of what had once been iron, scribed on both sides with
a tight spiral and powered by a flow of Spirit, the only one of the
Five Powers that could be channeled in your sleep. Except here,
anyway. The other three would be carrying small plaques once amber,
with a sleeping woman worked inside each. Even if she had all six
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> in front of her, Elayne would not have
been able to pick out the two originals; those copies had gone very
well. Just the same, it was still copying.</p>

<p>As the Aes Sedai came down the dirt street together,
she heard the tail end of their conversation, though she could not
make head nor foot of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;will scorn our choice, Carlinya,&rdquo;
fiery-haired Sheriam was saying, &ldquo;but they will scorn any choice we
make. We might as well stay by our decision. You do not need me to
list reasons again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morvrin, a stout Brown sister with gray-streaked
hair, snorted. &ldquo;After all our work with the Hall, we would have a
hard time changing their minds now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as no ruler scoffs, why should we care?&rdquo;
Myrelle said heatedly. The youngest of the six, not many years Aes
Sedai, she sounded decidedly irritated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ruler would dare?&rdquo; Anaiya asked, much like a
woman asking what child would dare track mud on her carpets. &ldquo;In
any case, no king or queen knows enough of what passes among Aes
Sedai to understand. Only the sisters&rsquo; opinions need concern
us, not theirs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What worries me,&rdquo; Carlinya replied coolly, &ldquo;is that
if she is easily guided by us, she may be as easily guided by
others.&rdquo; The pale, almost black-eyed White was always cool, some
would say icy.</p>

<p>Whatever they were talking about, it was nothing they
wanted to discuss in front of Elayne or the others; they fell
silent just before reaching them.</p>

<p>Siuan and Leane&rsquo;s reaction to the newcomers had
been to turn their backs on each other sharply, as if they had been
having words interrupted by the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s arrival. For
Elayne&rsquo;s part, she quickly checked her dress. It was the
proper banded white. She did not know how she felt about that,
appearing in the right dress without thought; she would have
wagered that Nynaeve had had to change her garb after appearing.
But then, Nynaeve was far more intrepid than she, struggling
against limits that she herself acquiesced to. How could she ever
manage to rule Andor? If her mother was dead. If.</p>

<p>Sheriam, slightly plump and with high cheekbones,
turned tilted green eyes on Siuan and Leane. For a moment she wore
a blue-fringed shawl. &ldquo;If you two cannot learn to get along, I vow
I&rsquo;ll send both of you to Tiana.&rdquo; It had the sound of something
said often and no longer really meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You worked together long enough,&rdquo; Beonin said in her
heavy Taraboner accent. A pretty Gray with honey-colored hair in a
multitude of braids, she had blue-gray eyes that constantly looked
startled. Nothing surprised Beonin, though. She would not believe
the sun came up in the morning until she saw for herself, yet if
one morning it did not, Elayne doubted that Beonin would turn a
hair. It would just confirm that she had been right to demand
proof. &ldquo;You can and must work together again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beonin sounded as if she had said that so often that
she hardly thought of it. All the Aes Sedai were long since used to
Siuan and Leane. They had begun handling them as they might have
managed two girls who could not stop squabbling. Aes Sedai did have
a tendency to see anyone who was not as a child. Even these two who
once had been sisters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send them to Tiana or don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Myrelle snapped,
 &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t talk about it.&rdquo; Elayne did not think the darkly
beautiful woman was angry at Siuan or Leane. Perhaps not at anyone
or anything in particular. She had a volatile temper remarkable
even among Greens. Her golden yellow silk dress became high-necked,
but with an oval cutout that exposed the tops of her breasts; she
wore a peculiar necklace, too, like a wide silver collar supporting
three small daggers, hilts nestling in her cleavage. A fourth
dagger appeared and was gone so quickly it might have been
imagination. She eyed Nynaeve up and down as if searching for
fault. &ldquo;Are we going to the Tower, or aren&rsquo;t we? If we are
going to do this, we might as well accomplish something useful
while we are about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne knew why Myrelle was angry, now. When she and
Nynaeve first came to Salidar, they had been meeting Egwene in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> every seven days to share what they
had learned. Which had not always been easy, since Egwene was
always accompanied by at least one of the Aiel dreamwalkers she was
studying with. Meeting without a Wise One or two had taken some
pains. In any case, all that ended when they reached Salidar. These
six Aes Sedai of Sheriam&rsquo;s council had taken over the
meetings, when they had had only the three original <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> and little more knowledge of <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> than how to reach it. That had been
just when Egwene was injured, which left Aes Sedai facing Wise
Ones, two sets of proud resolute women, each suspicious of what the
other wanted, neither willing to yield an inch or bow her neck a
hair.</p>

<p>Of course, Elayne did not know what went on at those
meetings, but she had her own experiences to go by, and fragments
dropped here and there by Sheriam and the others.</p>

<p>Aes Sedai were sure they could learn anything once
they knew there was something to be learned, usually required the
respect due a queen, and always expected to be told what they
wanted to know without delays or quibbles. They had apparently
demanded answers about everything, from what Rand was planning to
when Egwene would be well enough to return to the World of Dreams,
to whether it was possible to spy on people&rsquo;s dreams in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> or to enter the World of Dreams
physically, or bring someone into the dream against their will.
They had even asked more than once whether it was possible to
affect the real world by what you did in the dream, a pure
impossibility they apparently doubted. Morvrin had read a little
about <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, enough to come up with
plenty of questions, though Elayne suspected Siuan supplied her
share. She thought Siuan was angling to attend the meetings
herself, but the Aes Sedai seemed to think it concession enough to
allow her to use the ring as an aid in her work with the
eyes-and-ears. Aes Sedai interference in that work was what upset
her.</p>

<p>As for the Aiel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Wise Ones&mdash;the
dreamwalkers, at least, Elayne was aware from her own encounters,
not only knew just about everything there was to know about the
World of Dreams, but looked on it almost as a private preserve.
They did not like anyone coming there in ignorance, and had a rough
way of dealing with what they saw as foolishness. Besides which,
they were a closemouthed lot, apparently fiercely loyal to Rand,
unwilling to say much more than that he was alive, or that Egwene
would return to <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> when she was well
enough, and more than unwilling to answer questions they considered
improper. Which last could mean that they did not believe the
questioner knew enough yet to hear the answer, or that question or
answer or both somehow violated their strange philosophy of honor
and obligation. Elayne knew little more of <em>
ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em> than that it existed, and that it made for
very peculiar, very touchy behavior.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a recipe for disaster, and Elayne
thought it very probably was served up fresh every seven days, at
least from the Aes Sedai point of view.</p>

<p>Sheriam and the other five had required lessons every
night in the beginning, but now there were only two times they did
so. The night before meeting the Wise Ones, as if to hone their
skills one last time before a contest. And the night after, usually
tight-mouthed, as if to work out what had gone wrong and how to
counter it. Myrelle was probably already seething over tomorrow
night&rsquo;s disaster. There surely would be one of some kind.</p>

<p>Morvrin turned to Myrelle and opened her mouth, but
suddenly there was another woman among them. It took Elayne a
moment to recognize Gera, one of the cooks, in those ageless
features. Wearing a green-fringed shawl with the Flame of Tar Valon
on her back and weighing no more than half what she really did,
Gera raised an admonitory finger to the Aes Sedai&mdash;and was
gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So those are her dreams, are they?&rdquo; Carlinya said
coolly. Her snow-white silk dress grew sleeves that hung in points
over her hands, and a high tight neck under her chin. &ldquo;Someone
should speak to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave over, Carlinya,&rdquo; Anaiya chuckled. &ldquo;Gera&rsquo;s
a good cook. Let her have her dreams. I can see the attraction
myself.&rdquo; Abruptly she became slimmer and taller. Her features did
not really alter; she wore the same plain, motherly face as always.
With a laugh she changed back. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see the fun in
something for once, Carlinya?&rdquo; Even Carlinya&rsquo;s sniff was
cool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clearly,&rdquo; Morvrin said, &ldquo;Gera saw us, but will she
remember?&rdquo; Her dark, steely eyes were thoughtful. Her dress, plain
dark wool, held the steadiest among the six. Details shifted, but
so subtly that Elayne could not really say what was different.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she will,&rdquo; Nynaeve said acerbically. She
had explained this before. Six Aes Sedai looked at her, eyebrows
rising, and she moderated her voice. A little. She hated scrubbing
pots, too. &ldquo;If she remembers the dream, she will. But only as a
dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morvrin frowned. She ran Beonin a close second in
wanting proof. Nynaeve&rsquo;s long-suffering expression was going
to get her in trouble, whatever her tone. Before Elayne could say
anything to take the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s attention from Nynaeve,
though, Leane spoke up with an expression close to a simper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we should go, now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan snorted contemptuously at the timidity, and
Leane cut her eyes at her sharply. &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ll want to have
as much time in the Tower as possible,&rdquo; Siuan said, diffident in
turn, and Leane sniffed.</p>

<p>They really did it very well. Sheriam and the others
never suspected that Siuan and Leane were not simply two stilled
women clinging to a purpose that might keep them alive, clinging to
the edge of what they had been. Two women childishly at one
another&rsquo;s throats all the time. The Aes Sedai should have
remembered that Siuan had had the reputation of a strong-willed and
devious manipulator, and to a lesser extent so had Leane. Had they
presented a unified front, or shown their true faces, the six would
have remembered, and looked hard at everything the pair said. But
divided, spitting rancor in each other&rsquo;s face, all but
groveling to the Aes Sedai and plainly not even aware of it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;when one was reluctantly forced to agree with what the other said,
it lent extra weight. When one objected on obviously frivolous
grounds, so did that. Elayne knew they used the pretence to guide
Sheriam and the others toward supporting Rand. She just wished she
knew what else they used it for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Nynaeve said firmly, giving
Siuan and Leane a disgusted look. Their pretence irked Nynaeve no
end: Nynaeve would not have groveled for her life. &ldquo;You should know
by now that the longer you spend here, the less real rest you get.
Sleep while you are in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>
doesn&rsquo;t do as much good as ordinary sleep. Now, remember that
if you see anything out of the ordinary, you need to be careful.&rdquo;
She truly did hate repeating herself&mdash;the fact showed clearly
in her voice&mdash;but with these women, Elayne had to admit it
was too often necessary. If only Nynaeve did not sound as if she
were talking to dim-witted children. &ldquo;When somebody dreams
themselves into <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> like Gera, but
they&rsquo;re having a nightmare, sometimes the nightmare survives,
and those are very dangerous. Avoid anything that looks unusual.
And try to control your thoughts this time. What you think of here
can become real. That Myrddraal that popped out of nowhere last
time might have been a leftover nightmare, but I think one of you
let her mind wander. You were talking about the Black Ajah, if
you&rsquo;ll remember, and discussing whether they were letting
Shadowspawn into the Tower.&rdquo; As if that were not bad enough, she
had to add, &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t impress the Wise Ones tomorrow night if
you drop a Myrddraal into the middle of everything.&rdquo; Elayne
winced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Child,&rdquo; Anaiya said gently, adjusting the
blue-fringed shawl that was suddenly looped over her arms, &ldquo;you
have been doing very good work, but that doesn&rsquo;t excuse a
peevish mouth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been given a number of privileges,&rdquo; Myrelle
said, not at all gently, &ldquo;but you seem to forget that they <em>
are</em> privileges.&rdquo; Her frown should have been enough to make
Nynaeve quake. Myrelle had been increasingly hard on Nynaeve the
past weeks. She had her shawl on, too. They all did, a bad
sign.</p>

<p>Morvrin snorted bluntly. &ldquo;When I was Accepted, any
girl who spoke to an Aes Sedai that way would have spent the next
month scrubbing floors, if she was due to be raised Aes Sedai the
next day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne spoke up hurriedly, hoping she could forestall
their own disaster. Nynaeve had put on what she probably thought
was a conciliatory face, but she looked sulky and stubborn. &ldquo;I am
sure she didn&rsquo;t mean anything, Aes Sedai. We have been working
very hard. Please forgive us.&rdquo; Adding herself might help, since she
had done nothing. It might also have them both scrubbing floors. At
least it made Nynaeve look at her. And think, apparently, since her
features smoothed into something that did seem appeasing and she
made a curtsy and stared at the ground as though abashed. Maybe she
really was. Maybe. Elayne rushed on as if Nynaeve had made a formal
apology and had it accepted. &ldquo;I know you all do want to spend as
much time as possible at the Tower, so perhaps we shouldn&rsquo;t
wait any longer? If you will all visualize Elaida&rsquo;s study,
just as you saw it last time?&rdquo; Elaida was never called the Amyrlin
in Salidar, and in the same way the Amyrlin&rsquo;s study in the
White Tower had its name shifted. &ldquo;Everyone fix it in your minds,
so we all arrive together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anaiya was the first to nod, but even Carlinya and
Beonin let themselves be diverted.</p>

<p>It was unclear whether the ten of them moved or <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> moved around them. It could have been
either from the little Elayne really understood; the World of
Dreams was almost infinitely malleable. One moment they were
standing in the street in Salidar, the next in a large and ornate
room. The Aes Sedai gave satisfied nods, still inexperienced enough
to be pleased at anything that worked as they thought it
should.</p>

<p>As surely as <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>
reflected the waking world, this room reflected the power of the
women who had occupied it over the last three thousand years. The
gilded stand-lamps were unlit, but there was light, in the odd way
of <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> and dreams. The tall fireplace
was golden marble from Kandor, the floor polished redstone from the
Mountains of Mist. The walls had been paneled a relatively short
time ago&mdash;a mere thousand years&mdash;in pale wood, oddly
striped and carved with marvelous beasts and birds that Elayne was
sure had come straight out of the carver&rsquo;s imagination.
Gleaming pearly stone framed tall arched windows that let onto the
balcony overlooking the Amyrlin&rsquo;s private garden; that stone
had been salvaged from a nameless city submerged in the Sea of
Storms during the Breaking of the World, and no one had ever found
its like elsewhere.</p>

<p>Each woman who used that room put her own mark on it,
if only for the time of her possession, and Elaida was no
different. A heavy throne-like chair, an ivory Flame of Tar Valon
cresting the high back, stood behind a massive writing table
ornately carved in triple-linked rings. The tabletop was bare
except for three boxes of Altaran lacquerwork, each precisely the
same distance from the next. A plain white vase stood atop a severe
white plinth against one wall. The vase held roses, the number and
color changing at every look, but always arranged with a harsh
rigidity. Roses, at this time of year, in this weather! The One
Power had been <em>wasted</em> to make them grow. Elaida had done
the same when she was advisor to Elayne&rsquo;s mother.</p>

<p>Above the fireplace hung a painting in the new style,
on stretched canvas, of two men fighting among clouds, hurling
lightning. One man had a face of fire, and the other was Rand.
Elayne had been at Falme; the painting was not too far from the
truth. A tear in the canvas across Rand&rsquo;s face, as though
something heavy had been thrown at it, had been mended almost
invisibly. Plainly Elaida wanted a constant reminder of the Dragon
Reborn, and just as plainly she was not happy having to look at
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will excuse me,&rdquo; Leane said before all the
satisfied nodding was done, &ldquo;I must see if my people have received
my messages.&rdquo; Every Ajah except the White had a network of
eyes-and-ears scattered across the nations, and so did a good many
individual Aes Sedai, but Leane was rare, perhaps unique, in that
as Keeper she had created a net in Tar Valon itself. No sooner had
she spoken than she vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She should not be wandering about alone here,&rdquo;
Sheriam said in an exasperated voice. &ldquo;Nynaeve, go after her. Stay
with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave her braid a tug. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very often you do not,&rdquo; Myrelle cut her off. &ldquo;For
once do as you are told, when you are told, Accepted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Exchanging wry glances with Elayne, Nynaeve nodded,
visibly suppressing a sigh, and disappeared. Elayne had little
sympathy. Had Nynaeve not indulged her irritation back in Salidar
it might have been possible to explain that Leane could be anywhere
in the city, that it would be almost impossible to find her, and
that she had been venturing into <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>
alone for weeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now to see what we can learn,&rdquo; Morvrin said, but
before anyone could move, Elaida was behind the writing table,
glaring.</p>

<p>An unyielding stern-faced woman, handsome rather than
beautiful, and dark of hair and eye, Elaida wore a blood-red dress,
with the striped stole of the Amyrlin Seat about her shoulders. &ldquo;As
I have Foretold,&rdquo; she intoned. &ldquo;The White Tower will be reunited
under me. Under <em>me</em>!&rdquo; She pointed harshly to the floor.
 &ldquo;Kneel, and ask forgiveness of your sins!&rdquo; With that, she was
gone.</p>

<p>Elayne let out a long breath, and was gratified to
realize she was not the only one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Foretelling?&rdquo; Beonin&rsquo;s forehead creased
thoughtfully. She did not sound worried, but she might well have.
Elaida did have the Foretelling, if fitfully. When the Foretelling
laid hold of a woman and she knew a thing would happen, it
did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dream,&rdquo; Elayne said, and was surprised at how
steady her voice was. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s asleep and dreaming. No wonder if
she dreams everything to her liking.&rdquo; <em>Please, Light, let it
only be that</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you notice the stole?&rdquo; Anaiya asked no one in
particular. &ldquo;It had no blue stripe.&rdquo; The Amyrlin&rsquo;s stole was
supposed to have one stripe for each of the seven Ajahs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dream,&rdquo; Sheriam said flatly. She sounded unafraid,
but she had her blue-fringed shawl on again and was clutching it
around her. So was Anaiya.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whether it is or not,&rdquo; Morvrin said placidly, &ldquo;we
may as well do what we came for.&rdquo; Not much could frighten
Morvrin.</p>

<p>The abrupt stir of activity at the Brown
sister&rsquo;s words made it suddenly clear how still everyone had
gone. She, Carlinya and Anaiya glided swiftly out to the anteroom,
where the Keeper&rsquo;s worktable would be. That was Alviarin
Freidhen, under Elaida; a White, strangely, though the Keeper <em>
always</em> came from the Amyrlin&rsquo;s own Ajah.</p>

<p>Siuan stared after them testily. She claimed there
was often more to be learned from Alviarin&rsquo;s papers than from
Elaida&rsquo;s, for Alviarin sometimes seemed to know more than the
woman she supposedly served, and twice Siuan had found evidence
that Alviarin had countermanded Elaida&rsquo;s orders, apparently
without repercussions. Not that she had told Elayne or Nynaeve what
orders. There were definite limits to Siuan&rsquo;s sharing.</p>

<p>Sheriam, Beonin and Myrelle gathered at Elaida&rsquo;s
desk, opened one of the lacquered boxes, and began rifling through
the papers inside. Elaida kept her recent correspondence and
reports there. The box, worked in golden hawks fighting among white
clouds in a blue sky, would suddenly shut again every time one of
them let go of the lid, until they remembered to hold it open, and
the papers themselves changed even as they were being read. Paper
truly was ephemeral. Amid vexed <em>tsks</em> and annoyed sighs, the Aes
Sedai persevered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a report from Danelle,&rdquo; Myrelle said,
hastily scanning a page. Siuan tried to join them&mdash;Danelle, a
young Brown, had been part of the cabal that deposed her&mdash;but
Beonin gave her a sharp frown that sent her back to a corner
grumbling to herself. Beonin had returned her attention to the box
and its documents before Siuan had taken three steps; the other two
women never noticed. Myrelle went right on talking. &ldquo;She says that
Mattin Stepaneos accepts wholeheartedly, Roedran is still trying to
take every side, while Alliandre and Tylin want more time to
consider their answers. There&rsquo;s a note here in Elaida&rsquo;s
hand. &lsquo;Press them!&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; She clicked her tongue as the
report melted into air in her hand. &ldquo;It did not say about what, but
there can be only two possibilities to take in those four.&rdquo; Mattin
Stepaneos was King of Illian and Roedran of Murandy, while
Alliandre was Queen of Ghealdan and Tylin of Altara. The subject
had to be Rand or the Aes Sedai opposing Elaida.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least we know our emissaries still have as good a
chance as Elaida&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Sheriam said. Of course, Salidar had sent
none to Mattin Stepaneos; Lord Brend of the Council of Nine,
Sammael, was the true power in Illian. Elayne would have given a
pretty to know what Elaida proposed that Sammael was willing to
support, or at least let Mattin Stepaneos say that he would
support. She was sure the three Aes Sedai would have given as much,
but they just went on snatching documents out of the lacquerwork
box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The arrest warrant for Moiraine, it is still in
force,&rdquo; Beonin said, shaking her head as the sheet in her hand
suddenly turned to a fat sheaf. &ldquo;She does not yet know Moiraine is
dead.&rdquo; Grimacing at the pages, she let them fall; they scattered
like leaves, and melted into air before settling. &ldquo;Elaida still
means to build herself a palace, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She would,&rdquo; Sheriam said dryly. Her hand jerked as
she took in what appeared to be a short note. &ldquo;Shemerin has run
away. The <em>Accepted</em> Shemerin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All three glanced at Elayne before turning back to
the box, which they had to open again. None made any comment on
what Sheriam had said.</p>

<p>Elayne very nearly ground her teeth. She and Nynaeve
had told them Elaida was reducing Shemerin, a Yellow sister, to the
Accepted, but of course they had not believed. An Aes Sedai could
be made to do penance, she might be cast out, but she could not be
demoted short of stilling. Only, it seemed that Elaida was doing
exactly as that, whatever Tower law said. Maybe she was rewriting
Tower law.</p>

<p>A number of things they had told these women had not
really been believed. Such young women, Accepted, could not know
enough of the world to know what could be and what not. Young women
were credulous, gullible; they might well see and believe what was
not there at all. It was an effort not to stamp her foot. An
Accepted took what Aes Sedai wished to hand out and did not ask for
what Aes Sedai did not choose to give. Such as apologies. She kept
her face smooth and her smoldering inside.</p>

<p>Siuan felt under no such restraints. Most of the time
she did not. When the Aes Sedai were not looking at her, she bathed
them all in a glower. Of course, if one of the three glanced in her
direction, her face became meek acceptance in a twinkling. She was
very practiced at that. A lion survives by being a lion, she had
once told Elayne, and a mouse by being a mouse. Even so, Siuan made
a poor and reluctant mouse.</p>

<p>Elayne thought she detected worry in Siuan&rsquo;s
eyes. This task had been Siuan&rsquo;s since she proved to the Aes
Sedai that she could use the ring safely&mdash;after secret
lessons for her and Leane from Nynaeve and Elayne, true&mdash;and
a prime source of information. It took time to reestablish contact
with eyes-and-ears scattered across the nations, and redirect their
reports from the Tower to Salidar. If Sheriam and the others meant
to take this over, Siuan might be less useful. In the history of
the Tower no network of agents had ever been run by any but a full
sister until Siuan came to Salidar with her knowledge of the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s eyes-and-ears, and the Blue Ajah&rsquo;s that she had
run before becoming Amyrlin. Beonin and Carlinya were openly
reluctant to depend on a woman who was no longer one of them, and
the others were not far behind. Truth to tell, they were none of
them comfortable around a woman who had been stilled.</p>

<p>There really was nothing for Elayne to do, either.
The Aes Sedai might call this a lesson, they might even think of it
so, but she knew from past experience that if she tried to do any
teaching without being asked, she would have her nose snapped off
in short order. She was there to answer any questions they might
have and nothing more. She thought of a stool&mdash;it appeared,
the legs carved in vines&mdash;and sat down to wait. A chair would
have been more comfortable, but it might occasion comment. An
Accepted sitting too comfortably was often considered an Accepted
with not enough to do. After a moment Siuan made herself an almost
identical stool. She gave Elayne a tight smile&mdash;and the Aes
Sedai backs a scowl.</p>

<p>The first time Elayne had visited this room in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, there had been a semicircle of such
stools, a dozen or more, in front of the heavily carved table. Each
visit since had seen fewer, and now none. She was sure that
indicated something, though she could not imagine what. She was
sure Siuan thought so, too, and very likely had puzzled out a
reason, but if she had, she had not shared it with Elayne or
Nynaeve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fighting in Shienar and Arafel is dying down,&rdquo;
Sheriam murmured half to herself, &ldquo;but still nothing here to say
why it began. Skirmishes only, yet Bordermen do not fight one
another. They have the Blight.&rdquo; She was Saldaean, and Saldaea was
one of the Borderlands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least the Blight is still quiet,&rdquo; Myrelle said.
 &ldquo;Almost too quiet. It cannot last. A good thing that Elaida has
plenty of eyes-and-ears through the Borderlands.&rdquo; Siuan managed to
combine a wince with a glare at the Aes Sedai. Elayne did not think
she had managed yet to make contact with any of her agents in the
Borderlands; they lay a long way from Salidar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would feel better if the same could be said of
Tarabon.&rdquo; The page in Beonin&rsquo;s hand grew longer and wider; she
glanced at it, sniffed, and tossed it aside. &ldquo;The eyes-and-ears in
Tarabon, they are still silent. All of them. The only word she has
of Tarabon is rumors from Amadicia that Aes Sedai are involved in
the war.&rdquo; She shook her head at the absurdity of committing such
rumors to paper. Aes Sedai did not involve themselves in civil
wars. Not openly enough to be detected, at any rate. &ldquo;And there are
no more than a handful of confused reports from Arad Doman, it
seems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will know about Tarabon soon enough ourselves,&rdquo;
Sheriam said soothingly. &ldquo;A few more weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The search went on for hours. There was never any
shortage of documents; the lacquered box never emptied. In fact,
the stack inside sometimes increased with the removal of a paper.
Of course, only the shortest held steady long enough to be read in
full, but occasionally a letter or report that had already been
scanned would come out of the box again. Long stretches passed in
silence, yet some documents elicited comment; a few the Aes Sedai
discussed. Siuan began stringing a cat&rsquo;s-cradle between her
hands, apparently paying no attention at all. Elayne wished she
could do the same, or better yet read&mdash;a book appeared on the
floor at her feet, <em>The Travels of Jain Farstrider</em>, before
she made it go away&mdash;but women who were not Aes Sedai were
granted more leeway than those training to be. Still, she learned a
few things by listening.</p>

<p>Aes Sedai involvement in Tarabon was not the only
rumor that had found its way to Elaida&rsquo;s writing table. Pedron
Niall&rsquo;s ingathering of the Whitecloaks was rumored to have as
its goal everything from seizing the throne of Amadicia&mdash;which he certainly had no need of&mdash;to crushing the wars and
anarchy in Tarabon and Arad Doman, to <em>supporting</em> Rand.
Elayne would believe that when the sun rose in the west. There were
reports of strange occurrences in Illian and Cairhien&mdash;there
might have been others, but those were the ones they saw&mdash;villages taken by madness, nightmares walking in daylight,
two-headed calves that talked, Shadowspawn appearing out of thin
air. Sheriam and the other two passed over those lightly; the same
sort of stories drifted to Salidar from parts of Altara and Murandy
and across the river from Amadicia. The Aes Sedai dismissed them as
hysteria among people learning of the Dragon Reborn. Elayne was not
so sure. She had seen things they had not, for all their years and
experience. Her mother was rumored to be raising an army in the
west of Andor&mdash;under the ancient flag of Manetheren, of all
things!&mdash;as well as being held prisoner by Rand and fleeing
to every nation imaginable, including the Borderlands and Amadicia,
which last was purely <em>un</em>imaginable. Apparently the Tower
believed none of it. Elayne wished she knew what to believe.</p>

<p>She stopped fretting over where her mother really was
when she heard Sheriam mention her name. Not speaking to her;
reading hurriedly from a square sheet of paper that became a long
parchment with three seals at the bottom. Elayne Trakand was to be
located and returned to the White Tower at all costs. If there was
any more bungling, those who failed would &ldquo;envy the Macura woman.&rdquo;
That made Elayne shiver; on their way to Salidar a woman named
Ronde Macura had come within an eyelash of sending her and Nynaeve
back to the Tower like bundles of wash to the laundry. The ruling
house of Andor, Sheriam read, was &ldquo;the key,&rdquo; which made as little
sense. The key to what?</p>

<p>None of the three Aes Sedai so much as glanced in her
direction. They just exchanged glances and went on with what they
were doing. Perhaps they had forgotten her, but then again, perhaps
not. Aes Sedai did what they did. If she was to be shielded from
Elaida, that was an Aes Sedai decision, and if they decided for
some reason to hand her to Elaida bound hand and foot, that was
their choice too. &ldquo;<em>The pike does not ask the frog&rsquo;s
permission before dining,</em>&rdquo; as she remembered Lini saying.</p>

<p>Elaida&rsquo;s response to Rand&rsquo;s amnesty was
evident in the condition of the report. Elayne could almost see her
crumpling the sheet of paper in her fist, starting to rip it apart,
then coldly smoothing it out and adding it to the box.
Elaida&rsquo;s rages were almost always cold. She had not written
anything on that document, but scrawled biting words on another
enumerating the Aes Sedai in the Tower, made clear she was almost
ready to declare publicly that any who did not obey her order to
return were traitors. Sheriam and the other two discussed the
possibility calmly. However many sisters intended to obey, some
would have far to travel; some might not even have received the
summons yet. In any case, such a decree would confirm to the world
all the rumors of a divided Tower. Elaida must be near panic to
consider such a thing, or else maddened beyond reason.</p>

<p>A sliver of cold slid down Elayne&rsquo;s backbone,
and nothing to do with whether Elaida was fearful or engaged. Two
hundred ninety four Aes Sedai in the Tower, supporting Elaida.
Nearly one-third of all Aes Sedai, almost as many as had gathered
in Salidar. It might be that the best that could be expected was
for the rest to split down the middle as well. After a great rush
in the beginning, the numbers coming into Salidar had slowed to a
trickle. Perhaps the flow to the Tower had dwindled as well. It
could be hoped.</p>

<p>For a time they did their searching in silence, then
Beonin exclaimed, &ldquo;Elaida, she has sent emissaries to Rand
al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo; Elayne leaped to her feet, and barely held her
tongue at a clutching gesture from Siuan, spoiled a little by her
failure to make the cat&rsquo;s-cradle disappear first.</p>

<p>Sheriam reached for the single sheet, but it became
three before her hand touched it. &ldquo;Where is she sending them?&rdquo; she
asked at the same time Myrelle asked, &ldquo;When did they leave Tar
Valon?&rdquo; Serenity hung on by its fingernails.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Cairhien,&rdquo; Beonin said. &ldquo;And I did not see when,
if it was mentioned. But they certainly will go on to Caemlyn as
soon as they discover where he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even so, that was good; it might take a month or more
to travel from Cairhien to Caemlyn. The Salidar embassy would reach
him first, surely. Elayne had a ragged map tucked away beneath her
mattress back in Salidar, and every day she marked off how far she
thought they might have traveled toward Caemlyn. The Gray sister
was not finished. &ldquo;It seems that Elaida, she means to offer him
support. And an escort to the Tower.&rdquo; Sheriam&rsquo;s eyebrows
rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is preposterous.&rdquo; Myrelle&rsquo;s olive cheeks
darkened. &ldquo;Elaida was Red.&rdquo; An Amyrlin was of all Ajahs and none,
yet no one could simply abandon where they came from.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That woman will do anything,&rdquo; Sheriam said. &ldquo;He
might find the White Tower&rsquo;s support attractive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we can send a message to Egwene through the
Aiel women?&rdquo; Myrelle suggested in a doubtful tone.</p>

<p>Siuan gave a loud, and very phony, cough, but Elayne
had had all she could stand. Warning Egwene was vital, of course&mdash;Elaida&rsquo;s people would surely drag her back to the Tower
if they discovered her in Cairhien, and not to a pleasant reception&mdash;but the rest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! &ldquo;How can you think Rand would listen to
anything Elaida says? Do you think he does not know she was Red
Ajah, and what that means? They aren&rsquo;t going to offer him
support, and you know it. We have to warn him!&rdquo; There was a
contradiction in that, and she knew it, but worry had hold of her
tongue. If anything happened to Rand, she would die.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how do you suggest that <em>we</em> do that,
Accepted?&rdquo; Sheriam asked coolly.</p>

<p>Elayne was afraid she must look like a fish, with her
mouth hanging open. She had not a clue what answer to give. She was
saved suddenly by distant screaming, followed by wordless shouts
from the anteroom. She was closest to the door, but she ran through
with the others on her heels.</p>

<p>The room was empty except for the Keeper&rsquo;s
writing table, with its piles of papers and stacks of scrolls and
documents, and a row of chairs against one wall where Aes Sedai
would sit while waiting to speak to Elaida. Anaiya, Morvrin and
Carlinya were gone, but one of the tall outer doors was still
swinging shut. A woman&rsquo;s frantic screams rolled through the
narrowing opening. Sheriam, Myrelle and Beonin almost knocked
Elayne down in their haste to reach the hall. They might have
appeared misty, but they felt solid enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; Elayne shouted, yet there was really
nothing to do but gather her skirts and follow as quickly as
possible with Siuan. They stepped into a scene from nightmare.
Literally.</p>

<p>Some thirty paces to their right, the tapestry-hung
corridor suddenly widened into a stony cavern that seemed to
stretch forever, lit in dim patches by the red glow of scattered
fires and braziers. There were Trollocs everywhere, great manlike
shapes, their all-too-human faces distorted by bestial muzzles and
snouts and beaks, sporting horns or tusks or feathered crests.
Those in the distance appeared more indistinct than the nearest,
only half-formed, while the nearest were giants twice as tall as a
man, even larger than any real Trolloc, all clad in leather and
black spiked mail, howling and capering around cookfires and
cauldrons, racks and strange spiked frames and metal shapes.</p>

<p>It really was a nightmare, though larger than any
Elayne had heard of from Egwene or the Wise Ones. Once freed of the
mind that created them, such things sometimes drifted through the
World of Dreams and sometimes latched on to a particular spot. Aiel
dreamwalkers destroyed each as a matter of course whenever they
found one, but they&mdash;and Egwene&mdash;had told her the best
thing to do was avoid any she saw altogether. Unfortunately,
Carlinya apparently had not listened when she and Nynaeve passed
that on.</p>

<p>The White sister was bound and hanging by her ankles
from a chain that disappeared into darkness overhead. To
Elayne&rsquo;s eyes the glow of <em>saidar</em> still surrounded
her, but Carlinya writhed frantically and screamed as she was
slowly lowered headfirst toward a great bubbling black kettle of
boiling oil.</p>

<p>Even as Elayne ran into the corridor, Anaiya and
Morvrin halted at the border where hallway abruptly became cavern.
For all of a heartbeat, they halted, then suddenly their hazy forms
seemed to elongate toward the boundary, like smoke drawn into a
chimney. No sooner had they touched it than they were inside,
Morvrin shouting as two Trollocs turned great iron wheels that
stretched her out tighter and tighter, Anaiya dangling by her
wrists as Trollocs danced about her, flogging her with metal-tipped
whips that tore long rents in her dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must link,&rdquo; Sheriam said, and the glow
surrounding her merged with that around Myrelle and Beonin. Even
so, it did not come near the brightness of that around a single
woman in the waking world, a woman who was not a misty dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Elayne shouted urgently. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t
accept it as real. You must treat it as&mdash;&rdquo; She seized
Sheriam&rsquo;s arm, but the flow of Fire the three had woven,
tenuous even with them linked, touched the dividing line between
dream and nightmare. The weave vanished there as if the nightmare
had absorbed it, and in the same instant the three Aes Sedai became
drawn out, mist caught in a wind. They had time only for startled
yells before they touched the boundary and vanished. Sheriam
reappeared inside, her head sticking up from a dark metal bell
shape. Trollocs turned handles and jerked levers on the outside,
and Sheriam&rsquo;s red hair flailed wildly as she shrieked in
rising crescendos. Of the other two there was no sign, but Elayne
thought she could hear more screaming in the distance, someone
wailing &ldquo;No!&rdquo; over and over, another shrieking for help.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember what we told you about dispelling
nightmares?&rdquo; Elayne asked.</p>

<p>Eyes fixed on the scene in front of her, Siuan
nodded. &ldquo;Deny its reality. Try to fix things in your mind as they
would be without it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That had been Sheriam&rsquo;s mistake, all the Aes
Sedai&rsquo;s mistake probably. By trying to channel against the
nightmare they had accepted it as real, and that acceptance had
pulled them into it as surely as walking in, leaving them helpless
unless they remembered what they had forgotten. Which they showed
no sign of doing. The climbing shrieks augured into Elayne&rsquo;s
ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The corridor,&rdquo; she muttered, trying to form in her
head how it had been when she saw it last. &ldquo;Think of the corridor
the way you remember it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying, girl,&rdquo; Siuan growled. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t working.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne sighed. Siuan was right. Not a line of the
scene before them so much as wavered. Sheriam&rsquo;s head was
almost vibrating above the metal shroud that enclosed the rest of
her. Morvrin&rsquo;s howls came in strained pants; Elayne almost
thought she could hear the woman&rsquo;s joints being pulled apart.
Carlinya&rsquo;s hair, hanging below her, was almost touching the
roiling surface of the hot oil. Two women were not enough. The
nightmare was too big.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need the others,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leane and Nynaeve? Girl, if we knew where to find
them, Sheriam and the rest would be dead before&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She trailed
off, staring at Elayne. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean Leane and Nynaeve, do
you? You mean Sheriam and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Elayne only nodded; she was too
frightened to speak. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they can hear us from
here, or see us. Those Trollocs haven&rsquo;t even glanced our way.
That means we have to try from inside.&rdquo; Elayne nodded again.
 &ldquo;Girl,&rdquo; Siuan said in a toneless voice, &ldquo;you have a lion&rsquo;s
courage, and maybe a fisherbird&rsquo;s sense.&rdquo; With a heavy sigh,
she added, &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see any other way myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne agreed with her about everything except the
courage. If she had not had her knees locked, she would have been
in a heap on the floor tiles, patterned in all the colors of the
Ajahs. She realized she had a sword in her hand, a great gleaming
length of steel, absolutely useless even had she known how to wield
it. She let it fall, and it vanished before reaching the floor.
 &ldquo;Waiting isn&rsquo;t helping anything,&rdquo; she muttered. Much longer,
and the little courage she had managed to scrape together would
surely evaporate. Together she and Siuan stepped toward the
boundary. Elayne&rsquo;s foot touched that dividing line, and
suddenly she felt herself being pulled in, sucked like water
through a tube.</p>

<p>One instant she was standing in the hallway, staring
at the horrors, the next she was lying on her belly on rough gray
stone, wrists and ankles tightly tied in the small of her back, and
the horrors were all around her. The cavern stretched endless in
every direction; the Tower corridor no longer seemed to exist.
Screams filled the air, echoing from rocky walls and a ceiling
dripping stalactites. A few paces from her a huge black cauldron
stood steaming over a roaring fire. A boar-snouted Trolloc,
complete with tusks, was tossing in lumps that seemed to be
unidentifiable roots. A cookpot. Trollocs ate anything. Including
people. She thought of her hands and feet free, but the coarse rope
still dug into her flesh. Even the pale shadow of <em>saidar</em>
had vanished; the True Source no longer existed for her, not here.
A nightmare in truth, and she was well and truly caught.</p>

<p>Siuan&rsquo;s voice cut through the screams in a
pained moan. &ldquo;Sheriam, listen to me!&rdquo; The Light alone knew what was
being done to her; Elayne could not see any of the others. Only
hear them. &ldquo;This is a dream! <em>Aah</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>aaaaaaah!</em>
Th-think how it should be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne took it up. &ldquo;Sheriam, Anaiya, everybody,
listen to me! You must think of the corridor as it was! As it
really is! This is only real as long as you believe it!&rdquo; She set
the image of the corridor in her head firmly, colored tiles in
ordered rows and gilded stand-lamps and brilliant woven tapestries.
Nothing changed. The screams still echoed. &ldquo;You must think of the
corridor! Hold it in your minds, and it will be real! You can
defeat this if you try!&rdquo; The Trolloc looked at her; it had a thick
sharp-pointed knife in its hand now. &ldquo;Sheriam, Anaiya, you have to
concentrate! Myrelle, Beonin, concentrate on the corridor!&rdquo; The
Trolloc heaved her on to her side. She tried to wriggle away, but a
massive knee held her in place effortlessly while the thing began
slicing at her clothes like a hunter skinning a deer carcass.
Desperately she held on to the image of the hallway. &ldquo;Carlinya,
Morvrin, for the love of the Light, concentrate! Think of the
corridor! The corridor! All of you! Think of it hard!&rdquo; Grunting
something in a harsh language never meant for a human tongue, the
Trolloc flipped her facedown again and knelt on her, thick knees
crushing her arms against her back. &ldquo;The corridor!&rdquo; she screamed.
It tangled heavy fingers in her hair, yanked her head back. &ldquo;The
corridor! Think of the corridor!&rdquo; The Trolloc&rsquo;s blade touched
her tight-stretched neck beneath her left ear. &ldquo;The corridor! The
corridor!&rdquo; The blade began to slide.</p>

<p>Suddenly she was staring at colored floor tiles under
her nose. Clapping hands to her throat, marveling that they were
free to move, she felt wetness and brought her fingers up to stare
at them. Blood, but only a tiny smear. A shudder rippled through
her. If that Trolloc had succeeded in cutting her throat&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;no
Healing could have cured that. Shuddering again, she pushed slowly
to her feet. It was the Tower hallway outside the Amyrlin&rsquo;s
study, with no sign of Trollocs or caverns.</p>

<p>Siuan was there, looking a mass of bruises in a torn
dress, and the Aes Sedai, misty forms of near ruin. Carlinya was in
the best shape, and she stood wide-eyed and shaking, fingering dark
hair that now ended frizzily a hand from her scalp. Sheriam and
Anaiya seemed to be weeping heaps of bloody rags. Myrelle huddled
in on herself, white-faced, naked and covered with long red
scratches and welts. Morvrin moaned every time she moved, and she
moved unnaturally, as though her joints did not work properly
anymore. Beonin&rsquo;s dress appeared to have been clawed to
shreds, and she was panting on her knees, more wide-eyed than ever,
holding on to the wall to keep from falling over.</p>

<p>Abruptly Elayne realized that her own dress and shift
were hanging from her shoulders, neatly sliced open down the front.
A hunter skinning a deer carcass. She shivered so hard she almost
fell. Repairing the garments was a simple matter of thought, but
she was not sure how long it would take to repair her memories.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must go back,&rdquo; Morvrin said, kneeling awkwardly
between Sheriam and Anaiya. Despite her stiffness and groans, she
sounded as stolid as ever. &ldquo;There is Healing to be done, and none
here can manage it as we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Carlinya touched her short hair again. &ldquo;Yes,
it might be best if we returned to Salidar.&rdquo; Her voice was a
decidedly unsteady version of its normal iciness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will stay a little while, if no one objects,&rdquo;
Siuan told them. Or rather suggested, in that ill-fitting humble
voice. Her dress was whole again, but the bruises remained. &ldquo;I
might learn a little more that&rsquo;s useful. All that&rsquo;s wrong
with me are a few lumps, and I&rsquo;ve had worse falling in a
boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look more as if someone had dropped a boat on
you,&rdquo; Morvrin told her, &ldquo;but the choice is yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will stay, too,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;I can help Siuan,
and I wasn&rsquo;t hurt at all.&rdquo; She was aware of the nick on her
throat every time she swallowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need any help,&rdquo; Siuan said, at the same
time that Morvrin said in an even firmer voice, &ldquo;You kept your head
very well tonight, child. Don&rsquo;t spoil it now. You are coming
with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne nodded grumpily. Arguing would get her nowhere
except into hot water. You would have thought the Brown sister was
the teacher here, and Elayne the pupil. They probably thought she
had stumbled into the nightmare the same way they did. &ldquo;Remember,
you can step out of the dream straight into your own body. You do
not have to go back to Salidar first.&rdquo; There was no way of telling
whether they heard her. Morvrin had turned away as soon as she
nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be easy, Sheriam,&rdquo; the stout woman said soothingly.
 &ldquo;We will be back in Salidar in a few moments. Be easy, Anaiya.&rdquo;
Sheriam at least had stopped crying, though she still moaned in
pain. &ldquo;Carlinya, will you help Myrelle? Are you ready, Beonin?
Beonin?&rdquo; The Gray raised her head and stared at Morvrin a moment
before nodding.</p>

<p>The six Aes Sedai vanished.</p>

<p>With a last glance at Siuan, Elayne was only a moment
behind, but she did not go to Salidar. Someone would very likely be
coming to Heal the scrape on her neck, if they had noticed it, but
for a little while they would be concerned with six Aes Sedai who
would wake looking as if they had been pushed through some
monstrous clockworks. Elayne had those few minutes, and another
destination in mind.</p>

<p>The Grand Hall in her mother&rsquo;s palace in Caemlyn
did not appear around her with any ease. There was a feel of
resistance before she stood on a red-and-white tiled floor beneath
the great arched roof, between rows of massive white columns. Once
more light seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. The huge
windows overhead, depicting the White Lion of Andor alternating
with the earliest queens of the realm and scenes of great Andoran
victories, were indistinct with the night outside.</p>

<p>Immediately she saw the difference from what she knew
that had made coming here difficult. On the dais at the end of the
hall where the Lion Throne should have stood was instead a
grandiose monstrosity made of Dragons sparkling gold and red in
gilt and enamel, with sunstones for their eyes. Her mother&rsquo;s
throne had not been removed from the chamber. It stood on a kind of
pedestal, behind and above the monstrous thing.</p>

<p>Elayne walked slowly down the hall and climbed the
white marble stairs to stare up at the gilded throne of Andoran
Queens. The White Lion of Andor, picked out in moonstones against a
field of rubies on the back, would have stood above her
mother&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing, Rand al&rsquo;Thor?&rdquo; she
whispered harshly. &ldquo;What do you think you are doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was terribly afraid that he was bungling matters
without her there to guide him between the pitfalls. True, he had
handled the Tairens well enough, and apparently the Cairhienin, but
her people were different, bluff and straightforward, with a
dislike of being maneuvered or bullied. What had worked in Tear or
Cairhien could blow up in his face like an Illuminator&rsquo;s
display of fireworks.</p>

<p>If only she could be with him. If only she could warn
him about the Tower&rsquo;s embassy. Elaida had to have some trick
hidden, to spring when he least expected it. Would he be sensible
enough to see it? For that matter, she had no idea what the Salidar
embassy&rsquo;s orders were. Despite Siuan&rsquo;s efforts, most Aes
Sedai in Salidar still seemed of two minds about Rand al&rsquo;Thor;
he was the Dragon Reborn, prophesied savior of humanity, but then
again, he was a man who could channel, doomed to madness, death and
destruction.</p>

<p><em>Take care of him, Min</em>, she thought. <em>
Reach him quickly and take care of him</em>.</p>

<p>A stab of jealousy hit her that Min would be there to
do what she wanted to. She might have to share him, but she <em>
would</em> have part of him all to herself. She <em>would</em> bond
him as her Warder, whatever it took.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be done.&rdquo; She stretched a hand up toward the
Lion Throne, to swear as queens had sworn since there was an Andor.
The pedestal was too high for her to reach, but the intent should
count. &ldquo;It <em>will</em> be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Time was running out. An Aes Sedai would be coming,
back in Salidar, to wake her and Heal the pitiful scratch on her
neck. With a sigh, she stepped out of the dream.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Demandred moved out from behind the columns of the
Grand Hall and looked from the two thrones to where the girl had
vanished. Elayne Trakand, unless he missed his guess wildly, and
using a minor <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> by the faint look of her,
one made for training beginning students. He would have given much
to know what was in her head, but her words and expression had been
plain enough. She did not like what al&rsquo;Thor was doing here,
not in the least, and meant to do something about it. A determined
young woman, he suspected. In any case, another thread in the
tangle yanked, however feeble the pull turned out to be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the Lord of Chaos rule,&rdquo; he told the thrones&mdash;though he still wished he knew why it had to be so&mdash;and opened a gateway to leave <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.</p>
