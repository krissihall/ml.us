<h4><em>A Bitter Thought</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s
Vilnar led his mounted patrol through the streets
of the New City, not far from the tall outer city wall, its gray
stone streaked with silver and white in the midday sun, he thought
about shaving his beard. Some others already had shaved; even if
everyone said the heat was unnatural, it must be cooler back in
Saldaea.</p>

<p>Letting his thoughts roam was safe enough. He could
guide his horse in his sleep, and only the most foolhardy cutpurse
would ply his trade anywhere near ten Saldaeans. They rode about at
random so the fellows would not know where they were safe. In
truth, more often than having to catch thieves, they merely
arrested those who came to them. The toughest bullyboy in Caemlyn
would come running for Saldaeans to take him up before the Aiel
could. So Vilnar kept half an eye on the street and let his mind
drift. He thought about the girl back home in Mehar he would like
to marry; Teryane&rsquo;s father was a merchant, and wanted a
soldier for a son perhaps more than Teryane wanted one for a
husband. He thought about the game those Aiel women had suggested;
Maiden&rsquo;s Kiss sounded innocent enough, but there had been a
gleam in their eyes he did not quite trust. Most of all, though, he
thought about Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>Vilnar had always wanted to see an Aes Sedai, and
certainly there could be no better place than Caemlyn now, unless
he went to Tar Valon one day. Apparently there were Aes Sedai all
over Caemlyn. He had ridden to Culain&rsquo;s Hound, where rumor had
a hundred, but at the last moment he could not make himself go in.
He was brave enough with a sword in his hand and a horse between
his knees and men or Trollocs in front of him, but the thought of
Aes Sedai turned him shy. Besides, the inn would not have
accommodated a hundred women, and none of the girls he saw could
possibly be Aes Sedai. He had gone to The Crown of Roses, too, and
watched from across the street, but he was not sure any of the
women he had seen was Aes Sedai, and that made him sure they were
not.</p>

<p>He cocked an eye at a thin woman with a wide nose
coming out of a tall house that must belong to a merchant; she
stood frowning at the street before finally donning a wide-brimmed
straw hat and hurrying off. Vilnar shook his head. He could not
have said how old she was, but that was not enough. He knew how to
recognize an Aes Sedai. Let Jidar claim they were so beautiful they
could kill a man by smiling, and let Rissen insist they were all a
foot taller than any man. Vilnar knew it was the face you could
tell by, the timeless face of an immortal. It must be impossible to
mistake that.</p>

<p>As the patrol came opposite the towered, vaulting
arch of the Whitebridge Gate, Vilnar forgot about Aes Sedai.
Outside, one of the farmer&rsquo;s markets stretched alongside the
road, long open stone sheds roofed in red or purple tiles, pens
full of calves and pigs and sheep, chickens and ducks and geese,
stalls selling everything from beans to turnips. Usually those
markets were a cacophony of farmers crying their wares, but now
except for the clamor of the animals silence marched along the
market toward the gate, beside one of the oddest processions Vilnar
had ever seen.</p>

<p>A long column of farmers four abreast on horseback
made the bulk of it, and there seemed to be wagons behind. Farmers
for sure in those rough coats, but every one of them in
Vilnar&rsquo;s sight had the longest bow he had ever seen slung
across his back, a full quiver at one hip and a long knife or short
sword at the other. Leading the procession was a white banner
bordered in red with a red wolf&rsquo;s head, and a mix of people as
odd as the column. There were three Aiel, afoot of course, two of
them Maidens, and a fellow whose bright green-striped coat and
virulent yellow breeches said he was a Tinker, except he had a
sword on his back. He was leading a horse as big as a Nashun draft
horse, with a saddle meant for a giant. The leader seemed to be a
heavy-shouldered shaggy-haired fellow with a short beard and a
wicked axe on his belt, and at his side rode a Saldaean woman in
dark narrow divided skirts who kept looking up at him with the
fondest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vilnar sat forward in his saddle. He recognized that
woman. He thought of Lord Bashere, in the Royal Palace right that
moment. More, he thought of Lady Deira, and his heart sank; she was
in the Palace too. If some Aes Sedai had waved her hand and turned
that column into Trollocs, Vilnar would have been overjoyed. Maybe
this was the price for daydreaming. Had he kept his mind on his
duty, the patrol would have been long past here by now. Still, he
had his orders.</p>

<p>Wondering whether Lady Deira would have his head for
a ball, he deployed his men in the gate.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Perrin let his dun stallion walk within ten paces of
the city gate before drawing rein. Stepper was as happy to stop; he
did not like the heat. The mounted men blocking the gate were
Saldaeans, by those bold noses and tilted eyes; some wore glossy
black beards, some thick mustaches, and some were clean-shaven.
Every man save one had a hand on his sword hilt. The air stirred
from them, not quite a breeze; there was no fear smell. Perrin
looked at Faile, but she was bent over Swallow&rsquo;s arched neck,
intent on fiddling with the black mare&rsquo;s bridle; she smelled
faintly of herbal soap and anxiety. They had heard news of
Saldaeans in Caemlyn these last two hundred miles and more, led by
Faile&rsquo;s father supposedly. That did not seem to worry Faile,
but she was certain her mother would be in Caemlyn as well. She
said that did not worry her either.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t even need the bowmen,&rdquo; Aram said
quietly, stroking the hilt that stuck up over his shoulder. His
dark eyes seemed eager; he certainly smelled eager. &ldquo;There are only
ten. You and I could cut through them ourselves.&rdquo; Gaul had veiled
himself, and almost certainly Bain and Chiad had too, on the other
side of Faile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No archers, and no cutting,&rdquo; Perrin said. &ldquo;And no
spears, Gaul.&rdquo; He did not say anything to Bain or Chiad; they only
listened to Faile anyway. Who did not appear ready to look up or
say a word any time soon. Gaul merely lowered his veil with a
shrug; Aram frowned in disappointment.</p>

<p>Perrin kept his expression mild as he turned back to
the Saldaeans. Yellow-gold eyes made some men nervous. &ldquo;My name is
Perrin Aybara. I think Rand al&rsquo;Thor will want to see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bearded fellow who had not touched his sword gave
a small bow from the saddle. &ldquo;I am Vilnar Barada, Lord Aybara,
Underlieutenant sword-sworn to Lord Davram Bashere.&rdquo; He said that
very loudly, and come to think of it, he had been avoiding looking
at Faile. She sighed at mention of her father and scowled at
Barada, the more so when he continued to ignore her. &ldquo;Lord
Bashere&rsquo;s orders,&rdquo; the man went on, adding as an afterthought,
 &ldquo;and the Lord Dragon&rsquo;s, are that no noble can enter Caemlyn
with more than twenty armed men or fifty servants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aram shifted on his horse. He was even more prickly
about Perrin&rsquo;s supposed honor than Faile, which was saying
something, but thank the Light, he would not unsheathe his sword
unless Perrin said to.</p>

<p>Perrin spoke over his shoulder. &ldquo;Dannil, take
everybody back to that meadow we passed about three miles back and
make camp. If a farmer shows up to complain, give him some gold and
smooth him down. Let him know he&rsquo;ll be paid for any damage.
Aram, you go with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dannil Lewin, a beanpole of a man with a thick
mustache that almost hid his mouth, knuckled his forehead despite
all the times Perrin had told him a simple &ldquo;all right&rdquo; would do,
and immediately began giving orders to turn everyone around. Aram
stiffened, of course&mdash;he never liked being far from Perrin&mdash;but he said nothing, equally of course. Sometimes Perrin
thought he had acquired a wolfhound in the former Tinker. Not good
for a man to be that way, but he did not know what to do about
it.</p>

<p>He expected Faile to say a good deal about sending
everyone back&mdash;he expected her to bring up what was due his
so-called position and insist on the twenty Barada had mentioned,
and as close to the fifty as they could manage as well&mdash;but
she was leaning out of her saddle to speak in whispers with Bain
and Chiad. He made a point of not listening, though he could still
make out parts of words. Something about men, sounding amused;
women always seemed either amused or angry when they talked of men.
Faile was the reason he had all these people trailing after him,
and the banner to boot, though he had not yet figured out exactly
how she had done it. There were servants back in the wagons, men
and women wearing livery with a wolf&rsquo;s head on the shoulder.
Even the Two Rivers folk had not complained; they seemed as proud
of it as any of the refugees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does that satisfy?&rdquo; he asked Barada. &ldquo;You can escort
the rest of us to Rand, if you don&rsquo;t want us running
loose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Barada&rsquo;s dark eyes darted to
Faile and away. &ldquo;I think that would be best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Faile straightened, Bain and Chiad trotted to the
line of horsemen and pushed through as if they were not there. The
Saldaeans did not even look surprised, but then, they must be used
to Aiel; all the rumors said Caemlyn was full of Aiel already.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must find my spear-brothers,&rdquo; Gaul said abruptly.
 &ldquo;May you always find water and shade, Perrin Aybara.&rdquo; And away he
darted after the women. Faile hid an amused smile behind a
gray-gloved hand.</p>

<p>Perrin shook his head. Gaul wanted Chiad to marry
him, but by Aiel custom, she had to ask him, and though according
to Faile she was willing to become his lover, she would not give up
the spear and marry. He seemed as affronted as a Two Rivers girl
would have been in the same circumstance. Bain seemed to be part of
it too, somehow; Perrin did not understand how. Faile professed not
to know, if a bit too quickly, and Gaul grew sullen when asked. An
odd people.</p>

<p>The Saldaeans made a way through the crowds, but
Perrin paid little mind to crowds or city. He had seen Caemlyn
once, some of it, and he did not much like cities anymore. Wolves
seldom came close to a city; he had not sensed one for two days.
What he did do was study his wife with sideways looks, trying not
to let her notice. He might as well have stared. She always rode
erect, but now she was stiff in her saddle, glaring at
Barada&rsquo;s back. The man&rsquo;s shoulders were hunched as if he
could feel her eyes. A falcon could not glare as well as Faile.</p>

<p>Perrin expected she was thinking of the same thing as
he, though maybe not along the same lines. Her father. She might
have a few explanations to make&mdash;she had run away, after all,
to become a Hunter for the Horn&mdash;but Perrin was the one who
had to face the Lord of Bashere, Tyr and Sidona and tell the man a
blacksmith had married his daughter and heir. It was not something
Perrin looked forward to. He did not think he was particularly
brave&mdash;doing what you had to do was not bravery&mdash;but he
had never really thought he might be a coward until now. The
thought of Faile&rsquo;s father dried his mouth. Maybe he should see
to setting up the camp. A letter sent to Lord Bashere could explain
everything. A carefully composed letter might take two or three
days to write. Maybe more. He was no hand with words.</p>

<p>A glimpse of the crimson banner waving lazily above
the Royal Palace brought him back with a thump. The rumors had
spoken of that. Perrin knew it was not the Dragon banner, whatever
the rumors said&mdash;some claimed it meant the Aes Sedai served
Rand; others that he served them&mdash;and he wondered why Rand
was not flying the Dragon banner itself. Rand. He could still feel
Rand pulling at him, greater <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> tugging at
lesser. It did not tell him where Rand was; it was not that kind of
pull. He had left the Two Rivers expecting to ride to Tear or maybe
the Light alone knew where, and only a river of rumors and tales
flowing west across Andor had brought him here. Some very
disturbing tales and rumors. No, what he felt was more a need
to be near Rand, or maybe Rand&rsquo;s need for him, like an itch
between his shoulders he could not scratch. Now it was close to
being scratched, and he almost wished it was not. He had a dream,
one that Faile would laugh at, adventurous as she was. He dreamed
of living in a small house with her, somewhere in the country, far
from cities and strife. There was always strife around Rand. But
Rand needed him, and he would do what he had to.</p>

<p>In a great, column-ringed courtyard overlooked by
marble balconies and pointed spires, Perrin slung his belt,
weighted by his axe, on the saddle&mdash;it was a relief to be rid
of it for a while&mdash;and a white-robed man and woman took
Stepper and Swallow. With a few words Barada turned Faile and him
over to cold-eyed Aielmen, many wearing scarlet headbands marked
with the black-and-white disc, who led them inside and with even
fewer words handed them to Maidens who were just as frosty. Perrin
did not recognize any of them from the Stone, and his efforts at
making conversation were met with blank looks. Their hands flashed
Maiden handtalk, and one was chosen out to take him and Faile
deeper into the Palace, a lean sandy-haired woman he thought might
be about Faile&rsquo;s age. She named herself Lerian, the only words
she spoke except to warn them not to wander. He wished Bain or
Chiad were there; a familiar face would have been pleasant. Faile
glided down the corridors like the grand lady she was, yet at every
crossing hallway she looked both ways quickly. Plainly she did not
want to be surprised by her father.</p>

<p>Finally they reached a pair of doors, each carved
with a lion, where two more Maidens rose from squatting on their
heels and still more handtalk flickered before the sandy-haired
Maiden went in without knocking.</p>

<p>Perrin was wondering whether it was always like this
around Rand now, Aiel guards and nobody speaking, when suddenly the
doors were flung open, and there was Rand in his shirtsleeves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin! Faile! The Light shine on your wedding day,&rdquo;
he laughed, kissing Faile lightly. &ldquo;I wish I could have been there
for it.&rdquo; She looked as confused as Perrin felt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; he exclaimed, and Rand laughed
again, clapping him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bode&rsquo;s here, Perrin. Bode and Jancy and all of
them. In Caemlyn, anyway. This is as far as Verin and Alanna got
them before they heard about the Tower.&rdquo; He looked tired, his eyes
drawn, though his laughter did not sound it. &ldquo;Light, Perrin, the
things they told me you&rsquo;ve been up to. Lord Perrin of the Two
Rivers. What does Mistress Luhhan say to that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She calls me Lord Perrin,&rdquo; Perrin muttered wryly.
Alsbet Luhhan had smacked his bottom more often growing up than his
mother had. &ldquo;She curtsies, Rand. She actually curtsies.&rdquo; Faile eyed
him askance. She said he embarrassed people when he tried to stop
all the bowing and curtsying; as for his embarrassment when they
did, she said it was part of the price he had to pay.</p>

<p>The Maiden who had gone in squeezed by Rand coming
out, and he gave a start. &ldquo;Light, I&rsquo;m keeping you in the door.
Come in; come in. Lerian, tell Sulin I need more punch. The melon.
And tell her to hop.&rdquo; For some reason the three Maidens laughed as
if Rand had said something funny.</p>

<p>One step inside the sitting room, a floral scent of
perfume told Perrin there was another woman there before he saw
her. When he did, he stared. &ldquo;Min?&rdquo; The hair in short curls, the
embroidered blue coat and breeches were wrong, but the face was
right. &ldquo;Min, it is you!&rdquo; Laughing, he caught her up in a hug. &ldquo;We
are gathering everybody, aren&rsquo;t we? Faile, this is Min. I told
you about her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was when he realized what he was smelling from
his wife, and put Min down while she was still grinning at him.
Suddenly he was too much aware that those tight breeches showed the
shape of Min&rsquo;s legs very well. Faile had very few faults, but
she did have a slight tendency toward jealousy. He was not supposed
to know she had chased Calle Coplin half a mile with a stick, as if
he would ever look twice at another woman when he had her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faile?&rdquo; Min said, holding out her hands. &ldquo;Any woman
who can put up with this hairy lummox long enough to marry him has
my admiration. I suppose he might make a good husband at that, once
you housebreak him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile took Min&rsquo;s hands smiling, but oh, that
acrid, bristly scent. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not succeeded in the housebreaking
yet, Min, but I intend to keep him at least until I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistress Luhhan curtsies?&rdquo; Rand shook his head in
disbelief. &ldquo;I will have to see that to believe it. Where&rsquo;s
Loial? Did he come? You didn&rsquo;t leave him outside?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He came,&rdquo; Perrin said, trying to keep an eye on
Faile without being obvious, &ldquo;but not all the way, not yet. He said
he was tired, and needed a <em>stedding</em>, so I told him one I
know of, an abandoned one north of the road from Whitebridge, and
he set off for it afoot. He said he would be able to feel it once
he was within ten miles or so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know Rand and Perrin very well?&rdquo; Faile
asked, and Min glanced at Rand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a while, anyway. I met them right after they
first left the Two Rivers. They thought Baerlon was a grand
city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On foot?&rdquo; Rand said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Perrin said slowly. Faile&rsquo;s scent was
changing, the thorny jealousy dwindling away. Why? &ldquo;He would rather
use his feet, you know. He bet me a gold crown he would be here in
Caemlyn no more than ten days after us.&rdquo; The two women were looking
at one another, Faile smiling and Min coloring slightly; Min
smelled faintly embarrassed, Faile pleased. And surprised, though
only a hint showed on her face. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to take his
coin&mdash;he has to go fifty miles or more out of his way&mdash;but he insisted. He wanted to make it five days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loial always did say he could outrun a horse,&rdquo; Rand
laughed, but there had been a pause. Laughter faded. &ldquo;I hope he
makes it safely,&rdquo; he said more seriously. He <em>was</em> tired,
and different in other ways, too. The Rand Perrin had last seen in
Tear had not been soft, far from it, but this Rand made that one
look an innocent farmboy. He did not blink often enough, as if a
blink might hide what he needed to see. Perrin recognized something
of that look; he had seen it on the faces of Two Rivers men after
the Trolloc attacks, after the fifth, the tenth, when it seemed
hope was gone but you went on fighting because the cost of giving
up was too great.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Dragon,&rdquo; Faile said, startling Perrin; she
had always called him Rand before, though they had been hearing the
title since Whitebridge, &ldquo;if you will forgive me, I will just have
a word with my husband then leave you two to talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hardly waited for Rand&rsquo;s surprised assent to
close on Perrin, turning him so her back was to Rand. &ldquo;I will not
go far, my dear heart. Min and I will have our own conversation
about things that would very likely bore you.&rdquo; Fussing with his
lapels, she began speaking hurriedly under her breath, so softly
that anyone except him would have had to strain their ears. She did
recall his hearing sometimes. &ldquo;Remember he is not your boyhood
friend any longer, Perrin. At least, not only that. He is the
Dragon Reborn, the Lord Dragon. But you are Lord of the Two Rivers.
I know you will stand up for yourself, and for the Two Rivers.&rdquo; The
smile she gave him was full of love and confidence; he wanted to
kiss her right there. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said in a normal tone. &ldquo;You are
all straight again.&rdquo; She no longer gave off the slightest scent of
jealousy.</p>

<p>Offering Rand a graceful curtsy and a murmur of &ldquo;My
Lord Dragon,&rdquo; she held out a hand to Min. &ldquo;Come, Min.&rdquo; Min&rsquo;s
curtsy was considerably less practiced, and made Rand start.</p>

<p>Before they reached the doorway, one of the doors
banged open and a tall liveried woman entered with a silver tray
holding goblets and a pitcher that gave off the smell of wine and
honey-melon juice. Perrin almost stared. Despite the red-and-white
dress, she could have been Chiad&rsquo;s mother, or maybe
grandmother with that short curled white hair. Frowning at the
departing women, she stalked to the nearest table and set down the
tray, her face a mask of meekness that seemed frozen in place. &ldquo;I
was told four, my Lord Dragon,&rdquo; she said oddly; he thought she
might be trying for humble respect but had something caught in her
throat, &ldquo;so I brought for four.&rdquo; Her curtsy made Min&rsquo;s look
elegant, and she slammed the door on her way out.</p>

<p>Perrin looked at Rand. &ldquo;Do you ever think women are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;strange?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you asking me? You are the married man.&rdquo;
Rand filled a silver-chased goblet with punch and handed it to him.
 &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know, you will have to ask Mat. I know less
every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; Perrin sighed. The punch was certainly
cooling, Rand did not seem to be sweating at all. &ldquo;Where is Mat,
anyway? If I had to guess, I would say in the nearest tavern, and
odds or evens whether he has a dice cup in his hands or a girl on
his knee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had better have neither,&rdquo; Rand said grimly,
setting down his punch untouched. &ldquo;He is supposed to be bringing
Elayne here to be crowned. And Egwene and Nynaeve, I hope. Light,
there&rsquo;s so much to do before she gets here.&rdquo; His head swung
like a bear&rsquo;s at bay; then he fixed on Perrin. &ldquo;Would you go
to Tear for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tear! Rand, I have been over two months on the road.
My bottom&rsquo;s taken on the shape of the saddle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can have you there tonight. Today. You can sleep
in a general&rsquo;s tent, and stay away from saddles as long as you
like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin stared at him; the man seemed serious.
Suddenly he found himself wondering how Rand&rsquo;s sanity was
holding. Light, it had to hold, at least until Tarmon
Gai&rsquo;don. He took a long swallow of the punch to wash the
bitter thought out of his mouth. What a way to think about a
friend. &ldquo;Rand, if you could set me down in the Stone of Tear right
now, I would still say no. I have to talk to someone here in
Caemlyn. And I&rsquo;d like to see Bode and the others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand did not seem to be listening. He flung himself
into one of the gilded chairs and stared at Perrin bleakly. &ldquo;You
remember how Thom used to juggle all those balls and make it look
easy? Well, I&rsquo;m juggling now for all I am worth, and it
isn&rsquo;t easy. Sammael in Illian; the rest of the Forsaken the
Light only knows where. Sometimes I don&rsquo;t even think they are
the worst of it. Rebels who think I&rsquo;m a false Dragon.
Dragonsworn who think they can burn villages in my name. Have you
heard of the Prophet, Perrin? No matter; he&rsquo;s no worse than
the rest. I have allies who hate each other, and the best general I
can name to face Illian wants nothing better than to charge off and
be killed. Elayne should be here in maybe a month and a half with
luck, but I may just have a rebellion on my hands here before then.
Light, I want to give her Andor whole. I thought of going to get
her myself, but that is the worst thing I could do.&rdquo; He rubbed his
face with both hands, speaking behind them. &ldquo;The very worst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does Moiraine say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s hands came down far enough for him to
look over them. &ldquo;Moiraine is dead, Perrin. She killed Lanfear and
died, and that&rsquo;s an end to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin sat down. Moiraine? It did not seem possible.
 &ldquo;If Alanna and Verin are here&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He rolled the goblet between
his palms. He could not really make himself trust either woman.
 &ldquo;Have you asked their advice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Rand&rsquo;s hand slashed a sharp cutting
gesture. &ldquo;They stay clear of me, Perrin; I made that plain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin decided to ask Faile to find out what was
going on from Alanna or Verin. The two Aes Sedai often made him
vaguely uneasy, but Faile seemed to get on well with them. &ldquo;Rand,
you know as well as I do it&rsquo;s dangerous to anger Aes Sedai.
Moiraine came looking for us&mdash;for you, anyway&mdash;but
there were times I thought she was ready to kill Mat, me <em>
and</em> you.&rdquo; Rand said nothing, but at least he seemed to be
listening, with his head tilted. &ldquo;If a tenth of the stories
I&rsquo;ve been hearing ever since Baerlon are even half-true, this
might be the worst possible time to have Aes Sedai angry with you.
I don&rsquo;t pretend to know what&rsquo;s going on in the Tower, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand gave himself a shake and leaned forward. &ldquo;The
Tower&rsquo;s split right down the middle, Perrin. Half think I am a
pig to buy at market, and the other half&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know
what they think, exactly. Three days in a row, I&rsquo;ve met some
of their embassy. I am supposed to meet again this afternoon, and I
still cannot pin them down. They ask a sight more questions than
they answer, and don&rsquo;t seem much pleased I won&rsquo;t give
them any more answers than they give me. At least Elaida&mdash;she
is the new Amyrlin, if you&rsquo;ve not heard&mdash;at least her
people say something, even if they do seem to think I&rsquo;ll be so
impressed by Aes Sedai curtsying that I won&rsquo;t dig too
deep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light,&rdquo; Perrin breathed. &ldquo;Light! You mean to say
part of the Aes Sedai really have rebelled, and you&rsquo;ve put
yourself square between the Tower and the rebels? Two bears ready
to fight, and you go picking cloud-berries between them! Did you
never think you might have enough trouble from Aes Sedai without
that? I tell you true, Rand. Siuan Sanche made my toes curl up in
my boots, but at least you knew where you stood with her. She made
me feel like I was a horse and she was trying to decide whether
I&rsquo;d do for a long hard ride, but at least she made it plain
she didn&rsquo;t mean to saddle me herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s laugh was too hoarse to hold any mirth.
 &ldquo;Do you really think Aes Sedai would leave me alone just because I
left them alone? Me? The Tower splitting is the best thing that
could have happened for me. They&rsquo;re too busy staring at one
another to turn full attention on me. Without that, there&rsquo;d be
twenty Aes Sedai everywhere I turned. Fifty. I have Tear and
Cairhien behind me, after a fashion, and a toehold here. Without
the split, every time I opened my mouth, there&rsquo;d be somebody
saying, &lsquo;Yes, but the Aes Sedai say.&rsquo; Perrin, Moiraine
did her best to tie cords to me until I forced her to stop, and
truth to tell, I&rsquo;m not so sure she stopped then. When an Aes
Sedai says she&rsquo;ll advise you and let you decide, she means she
knows what you should do and will make you do it if she can.&rdquo;
Taking up his goblet, he drank deeply. When he lowered it, he
seemed calmer. &ldquo;If the Tower was whole, I&rsquo;d have so many
strings tied to me by now, I could not move a finger without asking
six Aes Sedai for permission.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin very nearly laughed himself, and no more in
mirth than Rand. &ldquo;So you think it&rsquo;s better to&mdash;what?&mdash;play the rebel Aes Sedai off against the Tower? &lsquo;Cheer
the bull, or cheer the bear; cheer both, and you will be trampled
and eaten.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that simple, Perrin, though they don&rsquo;t know
it,&rdquo; Rand said smugly, shaking his head. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a third
side, ready to kneel to me. If they make contact again. Light! This
isn&rsquo;t how we should be spending our first hour together again,
talking about Aes Sedai. Emond&rsquo;s Field, Perrin.&rdquo; His face
softened almost to the Rand Perrin remembered, and he grinned
eagerly. &ldquo;I only had a short time with Bode and the others, but
they mentioned all kinds of changes. Tell me what&rsquo;s changed,
Perrin. Tell me what&rsquo;s the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a long while they talked about the refugees and
all the new things they had brought, new kinds of beans and squash,
new varieties of pear and apple, the weaving of fine cloth and
maybe carpets, making bricks and tiles, stonework and furniture
more ornate than anything the Two Rivers had seen in a long time if
ever. Perrin had grown used to the sheer numbers of people who had
come across the Mountains of Mist, but it seemed to stun Rand. The
advantages and disadvantages of the wall some wanted to put around
Emond&rsquo;s Field, and the other villages, were gone into in
depth, and stone walls versus log. At times Rand sounded his old
self, laughing over how all the women had been so hard against
Taraboner or Domani dresses in the beginning, and now were divided
into those who would wear nothing but good stout Two Rivers dresses
and those who had cut up all theirs for rags. Or over how a number
of the younger men were growing mustaches like Taraboners or
Domani, occasionally with an Almoth Plain goatee as well, which
made the unwise wearer look as though a small animal had latched on
under his nose. Perrin did not bother to add to that beards like
his own were even more popular.</p>

<p>It came as a shock, though, when Rand made it clear
he had no intention of visiting the camp, though there were any
number of men there he knew. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t protect you or Mat,&rdquo; he
said softly, &ldquo;but I can them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that the conversation naturally lagged, until
even Rand realized he had draped a blanket over it. Finally he
stood with a sigh, scrubbing his hands through his hair and looking
around in a disgruntled way. &ldquo;You must want to wash and rest,
Perrin. I should not keep you from it. I&rsquo;ll have rooms set
aside for you.&rdquo; Seeing Perrin to the door, he suddenly added, &ldquo;You
will think about Tear, Perrin? I need you there. There is no danger
involved. I will tell you the whole plan, if you decide to go.
You&rsquo;ll be only the fourth man to know the real plan.&rdquo;
Rand&rsquo;s face hardened. &ldquo;You must keep that to yourself, Perrin.
Don&rsquo;t tell even Faile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can hold my tongue,&rdquo; Perrin said stiffly. And a
little sadly. The new Rand was back. &ldquo;And I will think on
Tear.&rdquo;</p>
