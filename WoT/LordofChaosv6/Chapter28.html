Therin <em>was</em> there&mdash;Rand was sure
of it&mdash;but not a whisper sounded in his head that was not his
own. For the rest of the day he did try to think of other things,
useless as they might be. Berelain was ready to jump out of her
skin for the number of times he popped in on her to ask about
something she was perfectly capable of handling without him; he was
not sure, but he thought she started trying to avoid him. Even
Rhuarc began to look a little hunted after the tenth time Rand
cornered him over the Shaido; the Shaido had not stirred, and the
only choices Rhuarc could see were to leave them in
Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger or dig them out. Herid Fel had wandered
off, as Idrien quickly pointed out he often did, and was nowhere to
be found; when Fel became lost in thought, he sometimes lost his
way in the city, too. Rand shouted at her. Fel was not her fault,
not her responsibility, but Rand left her white and trembling. His
temper rippled like a line of thunderstorms sweeping in from the
horizon. He shouted at Meilan and Maringil till they shook in their
boots and left him with pasty faces, reduced Colavaere to
incoherent tears and actually sent Anaiyella running with her
skirts hiked to her knees. For that matter, when Amys and Sorilea
came to ask what he had told the Aes Sedai, he shouted at them as
well; from the look on Sorilea&rsquo;s face as they stalked away, he
suspected that might have been the first time anyone had ever
raised voice to her. It was knowing&mdash;<em>knowing</em>&mdash;that Lews Therin was really there, more than a voice, a man hiding
inside his head.</p>

<p>He was almost afraid to fall asleep when night came,
afraid Lews Therin might seize control while he slept, and when he
did sleep his troubled dreams made him toss and mutter. The first
hint of light though the windows woke him in tangled sweat-soaked
sheets, with grainy eyes, a mouth that tasted like a horse six days
dead, and legs that ached. The dreams he remembered had all been of
running from something he could not see. He levered himself out of
the great four-posted bed and made his ablutions at the gilded
washstand. With the sky just turning gray outside, the
<em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> who would bring fresh water had not
appeared yet, but last night&rsquo;s did well enough.</p>

<p>He had nearly finished shaving when he stopped, razor
poised against his cheek, staring at himself in the mirror on the
wall. Running. He had been sure it was the Forsaken he was running
from in those dreams, or the Dark One, or Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don, or
maybe even Lews Therin. So full of himself; surely the Dragon
Reborn would dream of being pursued by the Dark One. For all his
protests that he was Rand al&rsquo;Thor, it seemed that he could
forget as easily as anyone else. Rand al&rsquo;Thor had run away
from Elayne, from his fear of loving Elayne, just as he had run
from fear of loving Aviendha.</p>

<p>The mirror shattered, shards dropping into the
porcelain washbasin. The pieces remaining in the frame cast back a
fragmented image of his face.</p>

<p>Releasing <em>saidin</em>, he carefully scraped away
the last bit of lather and folded the razor deliberately. No more
running. He would do what he had to do, but no more running.</p>

<p>Two Maidens were waiting in the corridor when he
emerged. Harilin, a lanky redhead about his age, went running for
the others as soon as he appeared. Chiarid, a merry-eyed blonde old
enough to be his mother, accompanied him through hallways where
only a few servants stirred, surprised to see him so early. Usually
Chiarid liked to make jokes at his expense when they were alone&mdash;he understood some; she saw him as a younger brother who
needed to be kept from getting too big for his hat&mdash;but she
felt his mood this morning and said not a word. She did give his
sword one disgusted glance, but only one.</p>

<p>Nandera and the rest of the Maidens caught up before
he was halfway to the Traveling chamber, and caught his silence as
quickly. So did the Mayeners and Black Eyes guarding the
square-carved door. Rand thought he might leave Cairhien without
anyone speaking until a young woman in the red-and-blue of
Berelain&rsquo;s personal servants rushed in and bobbed a deep
curtsy just as he opened the gateway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The First sends this,&rdquo; she panted, extending a
letter with a large green seal. Apparently she had run all the way
trying to find him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s from the Sea Folk, my Lord
Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stuffed the letter into his coat pocket and
stepped through the gateway, ignoring the woman&rsquo;s question as
to whether there was any reply. Silence suited him this morning. He
ran a thumb along the carving on the Dragon Scepter. He would be
strong and hard, and put all this self-pity behind him.</p>

<p>The dark Grand Hall in Caemlyn brought Alanna
nestling back into his head. Night still held here, but she was
awake; he knew as surely as he knew she was weeping, as surely as
he knew her tears stopped moments after he closed the gateway
behind the last of the Maidens. A small ball of ragged unreadable
emotion still sat in the back of his head, yet he was certain she
knew he had returned. No doubt she and her bond had played their
part in his flight, but he accepted the bond now even if he did not
like it. That nearly made him chuckle wryly; he had better accept
it, since he could not change it. She had tied a thread to him&mdash;no more than a thread; Light, let it be no more&mdash;and it should not cause trouble unless he let her close
enough to make it a leash. He wished Thom Merrilin were there; Thom
probably knew all about Warders and bonds; he knew surprising
things. Well, finding Elayne would find Thom. That was all there
was to it.</p>

<p><em>Saidin</em> made a globe of light, Fire and Air,
to illumine the way out of the throne room. The ancient queens,
hidden in the darkness far overhead, did not bother him at all.
They were only pictures in colored glass.</p>

<p>The same could not be said of Aviendha. Outside his
apartments Nandera dismissed the Maidens except for Jalani, and the
two went in with him to check the rooms while he used the Power to
light the lamps and tossed the Dragon Scepter onto a small
ivory-inlaid table that had considerably less gilt than it would
have had in the Sun Palace. All the furnishings were that way, with
less gilding and more carving, usually lions or roses. One large
red carpet covered the floor, with gold thread outlining roses.</p>

<p>Without <em>saidin</em> in him, he doubted he could
have heard the Maidens&rsquo; soft footfalls, but before they
crossed the anteroom Aviendha came stalking out of the still dark
bedchamber with her hair in wild disarray and her belt knife in
hand. And wearing only her skin. At the sight of him she went stiff
as a post and stalked back the way she had come, little short of
running. A small light appeared through the doorway, a lamp lit.
Nandera laughed softly and exchanged amused glances with
Jalani.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will never understand Aiel,&rdquo; Rand muttered,
pushing the Source away. It was not so much that the Maidens found
the situation funny; he had long since given up on Aiel humor. It
was Aviendha. She might think it <em>very</em> funny to undress for
bed in front of him, but let him catch so much as a glimpse of
ankle when she did not choose to show it, and she turned into a
scalded cat. Not to mention blaming him.</p>

<p>Nandera chortled. &ldquo;It is not Aiel you cannot
understand, but women. No man has ever understood women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men, on the other hand,&rdquo; Jalani put in, &ldquo;are very
simple.&rdquo; He stared at her, with the baby fat still on her cheeks,
and she colored faintly. Nandera looked ready to laugh out
loud.</p>

<p><em>Death</em>, Lews Therin whispered.</p>

<p>Rand forgot everything else. <em>Death? What do you
mean?</em></p>

<p><em>Death comes</em>.</p>

<p><em>What kind of death?</em> Rand demanded. <em>What
are you talking about?</em></p>

<p><em>Who are you? Where am I?</em></p>

<p>Rand felt as though a fist had clutched his throat.
He had been sure, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;this was the first time Lews Therin had
said anything to him, something clearly and plainly addressed to
him. <em>I am Rand al&rsquo;Thor. You are inside my head</em>.</p>

<p><em>Inside</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>? No! I am myself! I am
Lews Therin Telamon! I am meeeeeeeeee!</em> The cry faded away into
the distance.</p>

<p><em>Come back</em>, Rand shouted. <em>What death?
Answer me, burn you!</em> Silence. He shifted uneasily. Knowing was
one thing, but a dead man, inside him, talking of death, made him
feel unclean, like the faintest brush of the taint on
<em>saidin</em>.</p>

<p>Something touched his arm, and he nearly seized at
the Source again before he realized it was Aviendha. She must have
flown into her clothes, yet she looked as if she had taken an hour
to arrange every hair to her liking. People said Aiel showed no
emotion, but it was just that they were more reserved than most.
Their faces told as much as anyone else&rsquo;s if you knew what to
look for. Aviendha was torn between concern and wanting to be
angry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you well?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just thinking,&rdquo; he told her. True enough.
<em>Answer me, Lews Therin! Come back and answer me!</em> Why had
he ever thought silence suited the morning?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Aviendha took him at his word, and if
there was nothing to be concerned about&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she put her fists on
her hips. That was one thing he understood about women, Aiel, Two
Rivers or whoever; fists on hips meant trouble. He need not have
bothered lighting the lamps; her eyes were hot enough to light the
room. &ldquo;You went away without me again. I promised the Wise Ones to
stay near you until I must go, but you make my promise nothing. You
have <em>toh</em> to me for this, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Nandera, from
now on I must be told where he is going and when. He must not be
allowed to go without me if I should accompany him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nandera hesitated not a moment before nodding. &ldquo;It
shall be as you wish, Aviendha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand squared around on both women. &ldquo;Now, just you
wait! Nobody is to be told my comings and goings unless I say
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have given my word, Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; Nandera
said in a flat voice. She looked him in the eye with no notion of
backing up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As do I,&rdquo; Jalani said just as levelly.</p>

<p>Rand opened his mouth, then closed it again. Bloody
<em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>. No use mentioning he was the
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, of course. Aviendha looked faintly
surprised that he had even protested; apparently to her it was a
foregone conclusion. He shifted his shoulders uneasily, though not
because of Aviendha. That unclean feel was still there, and
stronger. Maybe Lews Therin had come back. Silently Rand called to
him, but there was still no answer.</p>

<p>A tap on the door barely preceded Mistress Harfor,
who made her usual deep curtsy. The First Maid showed no sign of
the early hour, of course; whatever the time of day, Reene Harfor
always looked as if she had just gotten dressed. &ldquo;There have been
arrivals in the city, my Lord Dragon, which Lord Bashere thought
you should be told of as soon as possible. Lady Aemlyn and Lord
Culhan entered yesterday at noon, and are staying with Lord
Pelivar. Lady Arathelle came an hour later, with a large retinue.
Lord Barel and Lord Macharan, Lady Sergase and Lady Negara entered
separately in the night, with only a few retainers each. None has
presented their respects at the Palace.&rdquo; She delivered the last in
the same even tone, with no hint of her own opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is good news,&rdquo; he told her, and it was, whether
they had left respects or not. Aemlyn and her husband Culhan were
nearly as powerful as Pelivar, Arathelle more powerful than any
except Dyelin and Luan. The others were of minor Houses, and only
Barel among them High Seat of his House, but the nobles who had
opposed &ldquo;Gaebril&rdquo; were beginning to gather. At least, it was good
news provided he found Elayne before they decided to try taking
Caemlyn away from him.</p>

<p>Mistress Harfor eyed him a moment, then extended a
blue-sealed letter. &ldquo;This was delivered late last evening, my Lord
Dragon. By a stableboy. A dirty stableboy. The Sea Folk
Wavemistress was not well pleased that you were gone when she
appeared for her audience.&rdquo; This time her disapproval was clear in
her voice, though not whether it was for the Wavemistress or Rand
missing the audience or the means of the letter&rsquo;s
delivery.</p>

<p>He sighed; he had forgotten all about the Sea Folk
here in Caemlyn. That reminded him of the letter he had been given
in Cairhien, and he dug it out. Both green wax and blue bore the
same impression, though he could not make out what it was supposed
to be. Two things like flattened bowls with a thick ornate line
running from one through the other. Each was addressed to &ldquo;The
Coramoor,&rdquo; whoever or whatever that was. Himself, he supposed.
Maybe that was what the Sea Folk called the Dragon Reborn. He broke
the blue seal first. There was no salutation, and it was certainly
unlike anything else Rand had ever seen addressed to the Dragon
Reborn.</p>

<p class="note">The Light willing, you will perhaps return to Caemlyn
eventually. As I have traveled far to see you, perhaps I will find
time for it when you do.</p>

<p class="note_sig">Zaida din Parede Blackwing<br>
 of Clan Catelar, Wavemistress</p>

<p>It seemed Mistress Harfor was right; the Wavemistress
was not best pleased. The green seal hid little better.</p>

<p class="note">If it pleases the Light, I will receive you on the
deck of White Spray at your earliest convenience.</p>

<p class="note_sig">Harine din Togara Two Winds<br>
 of Clan Shodein, Wavemistress</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they bad news?&rdquo; Aviendha asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Frowning at the letters, he was
barely aware of Mistress Harfor admitting a woman in the
red-and-white and exchanging quiet words with her. Neither of these
Sea Folk women sounded like anybody he wanted to spend an hour
with. He had read every translation of the Prophecies of the Dragon
he could find, and though the clearest was often murky, he
remembered nothing that indicated the Atha&rsquo;an Miere. Perhaps,
on their ships at sea and their distant islands, they would be one
people untouched by him or Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don. He owed this Zaida
an apology, but maybe he could fob her off with Bashere; Bashere
certainly had enough titles to flatter anybody&rsquo;s vanity. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servant sank to her knees before him, white head
bowed low and hands raised high to proffer yet another letter, this
one on thick parchment. The posture itself made him blink; even in
Tear he had never seen a servant cringe so, much less in Andor.
Mistress Harfor was frowning and shaking her head. The kneeling
woman spoke, still with her face down. &ldquo;This has come for my Lord
Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sulin?&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;What are you doing? What are you
doing in that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>dress</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sulin turned her face up; she looked perfectly
horrible, a wolf trying very hard to pretend she was a doe. &ldquo;It is
what women wear who serve and obey as commanded for coins.&rdquo; She
waggled the letter in her still upraised hands. &ldquo;I was commanded to
say that this has just come for my Lord Dragon, by a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a
horseman who left as soon as it was handed over.&rdquo; The First Maid
clicked her tongue irritably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want a straight answer,&rdquo; he said, snatching the
sealed parchment. She bounded to her feet as soon as it left her
hands. &ldquo;Come back here, Sulin. Sulin, I want an answer!&rdquo; But she
ran as fleetly as she ever had in <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em>, straight
to the doors and out.</p>

<p>For some reason Mistress Harfor glared at Nandera. &ldquo;I
told you this would not work. And I told you both that as long as
she wears the Palace livery, I expect her to do the Palace proud
whether she&rsquo;s Aiel or the Queen of Saldaea.&rdquo; Curtsying, she
gave Rand a hasty &ldquo;My Lord Dragon&rdquo; and stalked out talking to
herself about crazy Aiel.</p>

<p>He was ready to agree. He looked from Nandera to
Aviendha to Jalani. None of them appeared in the least surprised.
Not one looked as if she had seen a thing out of the ordinary.
 &ldquo;Will you tell me what under the Light is going on? That was
Sulin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; Nandera said, &ldquo;Sulin and I went to the
kitchens. She thought scrubbing pots and the like would be
suitable. But a fellow there said he had all the scullions he
needed; he seemed to think Sulin would always be fighting the
others. He was not very tall,&rdquo; she marked just under Rand&rsquo;s
chin, &ldquo;but just as wide, and I think he would have offered to dance
the spears with us if we had not gone away. Then we went to the
woman Reene Harfor, since she seems to be roofmistress here.&rdquo; A
slight grimace passed over her face; a woman should be roofmistress
or not&mdash;Aiel thinking held no place for a First Maid. &ldquo;She
did not understand, but at last she agreed. I almost thought Sulin
would change her mind when she realized Reene Harfor meant her to
put on a dress, but of course she did not. Sulin has more courage
than I. I would rather be made <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> by a new
<em>Seia Doon</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; Jalani said stoutly, &ldquo;would rather be beaten by
the first-brother of my worst enemy in front of my mother every day
for a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nandera&rsquo;s eyes tightened in disapproval and her
fingers twitched, but instead of handtalk she said deliberately,
 &ldquo;You boast like a Shaido, girl.&rdquo; Had Jalani been older, the three
calculated insults might have caused trouble, but instead she
squeezed her eyes shut to hide the sight of those who had heard her
shamed.</p>

<p>Rand scrubbed fingers through his hair. &ldquo;Reene
didn&rsquo;t understand? I don&rsquo;t understand, Nandera. Why is
she doing this? Has she given up the spear? If she&rsquo;s married
an Andorman&rdquo;&mdash;stranger things had happened around him&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give her enough gold to buy a farm or whatever they
want. She doesn&rsquo;t have to become a servant.&rdquo; Jalani&rsquo;s
eyes shot open, and the three women were looking at him as if
<em>he</em> was the one mad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sulin is meeting her <em>toh</em>, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; Aviendha said firmly; she stood very straight and
met his gaze directly, a good imitation of Amys. Only there was
less imitation in it every day and more her. &ldquo;It does not concern
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jalani nodded a very definite agreement. Nandera only
stood there, idly examining a spearpoint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sulin concerns me,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;If something
happened to her&mdash;&rdquo; Suddenly he remembered the exchange he had
overheard before going to Shadar Logoth. Nandera had accused Sulin
of speaking to <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> as <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>,
and Sulin admitted it and said they would deal with it later. He
had not seen Sulin since returning from Shadar Logoth, but he had
assumed she was angry with him and simply letting others do the
work of guarding him. He should have known better. Being around any
Aiel for long would teach you some of <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>,
and Maidens were touchier than anyone, except maybe Stone Dogs and
Black Eyes. Then there was Aviendha and her attempts to turn him
into an Aiel.</p>

<p>This situation was simple, or as simple as anything
ever was in <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>. If he had not been so
caught up in himself, he would have realized from the first. You
could remind even a roofmistress who she was every day she wore
<em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> white&mdash;it was deeply shaming, but
permitted, even encouraged sometimes&mdash;yet for the members of
nine of the thirteen societies, that reminder was a deep dishonor
except under a handful of circumstances he could not recall.
<em>Far Dareis Mai</em> was most definitely one of the nine. It was
one of the few ways to incur <em>toh</em> toward a
<em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, but that was considered the hardest
obligation of all to meet. Seemingly Sulin had chosen to meet it by
accepting a greater shame, in Aiel eyes, than she had given. It was
her <em>toh</em>, so her choice how to meet it, her choice how long
she continued to do what she despised. Who knew the worth of her
honor or the depth of her obligation better than she herself?
Still, she had only done what she did in the first place because he
had not allowed her enough time. &ldquo;It is my fault,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>That was the wrong thing to say. Jalani gave him a
startled stare. Aviendha flushed with embarrassment; she
continually drove home that there were no excuses under
<em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>. If saving your child brought an
obligation to a blood enemy, you paid the price without
quibble.</p>

<p>The look Nandera shot at Aviendha could charitably be
called disparaging. &ldquo;If you stopped daydreaming about his eyebrows,
you would teach him better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha&rsquo;s face went dark with indignation, but
Nandera flashed handtalk at Jalani, which made Jalani throw back
her head and laugh, and made the crimson in Aviendha&rsquo;s cheeks
brighten and return to pure embarrassment. Rand half-expected to
hear an offer to dance spears. Well, not that exactly; Aviendha had
taught him that neither Wise Ones nor their apprentices did that
sort of thing. But it would not surprise him if she boxed
Nandera&rsquo;s ears.</p>

<p>He spoke quickly to forestall any such thing. &ldquo;Since
I caused Sulin to do what she did, don&rsquo;t I have <em>toh</em>
toward her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apparently it was possible to make a bigger fool of
himself than he already had. Somehow Aviendha&rsquo;s face grew
redder still, and Jalani took a sudden interest in the carpet under
her feet. Even Nandera looked a little chagrined at his ignorance.
You could be told that you had <em>toh</em>, though that was
insulting, or you could be reminded of it, but asking meant that
you did not know. Well, he knew that he did. He could begin by
ordering Sulin out of that ridiculous job as a servant, letting her
put on <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em> again, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and stop her from
meeting her <em>toh</em>. Anything he did to lighten her burden
would interfere with her honor. Her <em>toh</em>, her choice. There
was something in that, but he could not see what. Maybe he could
ask Aviendha. Later, when she would not die from mortification. All
three women&rsquo;s faces made it clear he had embarrassed her more
than enough for the time being. Light, what a mess.</p>

<p>Wondering how he could find a way out, he realized he
still held the letter Sulin had brought. He thrust it into a pocket
and unbuckled his sword belt to lay it atop the Dragon Scepter,
then retrieved the parchment. Who would send him a message by a
rider who did not even stop for breakfast? There was nothing on the
outside, no name; only the now vanished courier could have said who
it was directed to. Once more the seal was nothing he recognized,
some sort of flower impressed in purple wax, but the parchment
itself was heavy, of the most expensive sort. The contents, in a
fine lacy hand, brought a thoughtful smile.</p>

<p class="note">Cousin,</p>

<p class="note">The times are delicate, but I felt I must write to
assure you of my goodwill, and to express my hopes of yours in
return. Never fear; I know you and acknowledge you, but there are
those who would not smile on anyone who approached you save through
them. I ask nothing save that you hold my confidences in the fires
of your heart.</p>

<p class="note_sig">Alliandre Maritha</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you grinning at?&rdquo; Aviendha asked, peering
at the letter curiously. There was still a touch of anger around
her mouth for what he had put her through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just pleasant to hear from somebody simple
in her ways,&rdquo; he told her. The Game of Houses was simple compared
with <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>. There was enough of the name to
let him know who sent it, but if the parchment fell into the wrong
hands, it would seem a note to a friend, or maybe a warm reply to a
petitioner. Alliandre Maritha Kigarin, Blessed of the Light, Queen
of Ghealdan, would certainly never sign a letter so intimately to
someone she had never met, above all not to the Dragon Reborn.
Plainly she was worried about the Whitecloaks in Amadicia, and
about the Prophet, Masema. He was going to have to do something
about Masema. Alliandre was being cautious, not risking any more on
paper than she had to. And she reminded him to burn this. The fires
of his heart. Still, it was the first time any ruler had approached
him without his sword at that nation&rsquo;s throat. Now if he could
just find Elayne and give her Andor before he had another battle
here.</p>

<p>The door opened gently and he looked up, but saw
nothing and returned to the letter, wondering whether he had dug
out everything that was in it. Reading, he rubbed his nose. Lews
Therin and his talk of death. Rand could not rid himself of that
feel of filth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jalani and I will take our places outside,&rdquo; Nandera
said.</p>

<p>He nodded absently over the letter. Thom would
probably find six things in the first glance that he had
missed.</p>

<p>Aviendha put a hand on his arm, then snatched it
away. &ldquo;Rand al&rsquo;Thor, I must talk with you seriously.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly everything came together in his head. The
door had opened. He was smelling filth, not just feeling it, but it
was not really a smell. Dropping the letter, he pushed Aviendha
away from him hard enough that she toppled with a startled yell&mdash;clear of him, though; clear of danger; everything seemed to
have slowed down&mdash;and seized <em>saidin</em> as he spun.</p>

<p>Nandera and Jalani were just turning back to see what
had made Aviendha shout. Rand had to look carefully to see the tall
man in a gray coat that neither Maiden saw at all as he glided
right by them, dark lifeless eyes fixed on Rand. Even
concentrating, Rand found his own gaze wanting to slide past the
Gray Man. That was what he was; one of the Shadow&rsquo;s assassins.
As the letter was settling to the floor, the Gray Man realized Rand
had seen him. Aviendha&rsquo;s shout still hung in the air and she
was in mid-bounce from sitting down hard; a knife appeared in the
Gray Man&rsquo;s hand, held low, and he darted forward. Rand wrapped
him in coils of Air almost contemptuously. And a wrist-thick bar of
fire flashed past his shoulder, burned a hole through the Gray
Man&rsquo;s chest large enough for a fist. The assassin died before
he could twitch; his head fell over, and those eyes, no more dead
than they had been, stared at Rand.</p>

<p>Dead, whatever had been done to the Gray Man to make
him hard to see no longer held. Dead, he suddenly was as visible as
anyone else. Aviendha, just starting to gather herself on the
floor, gave a startled yelp, and Rand felt the goose bumps that
told him she had embraced <em>saidar</em>. Nandera&rsquo;s hand
jerked toward her veil with a bit-off exclamation, and Jalani
half-raised hers.</p>

<p>Rand let the corpse fall, but he held on to
<em>saidin</em> as he turned to confront Taim, standing in the
doorway of his bedchamber. &ldquo;Why did you kill him?&rdquo; Only part of the
cold hardness in his voice came from the Void. &ldquo;I had him captured;
he might have told me something, maybe even who sent him. What are
you doing here anyway, sneaking in through my bedroom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taim strolled in completely at ease, wearing a black
coat with dragons entwined around the sleeves in blue and gold.
Aviendha scrambled to her feet, and despite <em>saidar</em>, her
eyes said she was as ready to use her drawn belt knife on Taim as
she was to sheathe it. Nandera and Jalani had veiled, and stood
poised on their toes, spears ready. Taim ignored them; Rand felt
the Power leave the man. Taim did not even seem concerned that
<em>saidin</em> still filled Rand. That peculiar almost-smile
quirked his lips as he glanced at the dead Gray Man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nasty things, the Soulless.&rdquo; Anybody else would have
shivered; not Taim. &ldquo;I came to your balcony by gateway because I
thought you would want to hear the news right away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody who learns too fast?&rdquo; Rand broke in, and
Taim flashed that half-smile again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not one of the Forsaken in disguise, not unless
he&rsquo;s managed to disguise himself as a boy not much past
twenty. His name is Jahar Narishma, and he has the spark, though it
has not come out yet. Men usually show later than women. You should
return to the school; you would be surprised by the changes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand did not doubt it. Jahar Narishma was never an
Andoran name; Traveling had no limits that he knew, but it seemed
Taim&rsquo;s recruiting had ventured far afield. He said nothing,
only glanced at the corpse on the carpet.</p>

<p>Taim grimaced, but he was not out of countenance,
only irritated. &ldquo;Believe me, I wish he was still alive as much as
you do. I saw him and acted without thinking; the last thing I want
is to see you dead. You seized him the moment I channeled, but it
was too late to stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>I must kill him</em>, Lews Therin muttered, and
the Power surged in Rand. Frozen, he struggled to push
<em>saidin</em> away, and it was a struggle. Lews Therin was trying
to hang on, trying to channel. Finally, slowly, the One Power faded
like water draining from a hole in a bucket.</p>

<p><em>Why?</em> he demanded. <em>Why do you want to
kill him?</em> There was no answer, only mad laughter and weeping
in the distance.</p>

<p>Aviendha was looking at him with a face full of
concern. She had put up her knife, but the tingle along his skin
said she retained <em>saidar</em>. The two Maidens had unveiled,
now that it seemed clear Taim&rsquo;s appearance was no attack; they
managed to keep one eye on Taim, one on the rest of the room, and
still give each other abashed glances for some reason.</p>

<p>Rand took a chair beside the table where his sword
lay atop the Dragon Scepter. The struggle had lasted only moments,
but his knees felt weak. Lews Therin had almost taken over, almost
taken over <em>saidin</em> at least. Before, at the school, he had
been able to fool himself, but not this time.</p>

<p>If Taim noticed anything, he showed no sign of it.
Bending to pick up the letter, he glanced at it before handing it
to Rand with a minimal bow.</p>

<p>Rand stuffed the parchment into his pocket. Nothing
shook Taim; nothing disturbed his balance. Why did Lews Therin want
to kill him? &ldquo;The way you were all for going after the Aes Sedai,
I&rsquo;m surprised you don&rsquo;t suggest striking at Sammael. You
and me together, maybe a few of the stronger students, dropping
right on top of him in Illian through a gateway. That man had to
come from Sammael.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Taim said shortly, glancing at the Gray
Man. &ldquo;I would give a great deal to be sure.&rdquo; That had the ring of
simple truth. &ldquo;As for Illian, I doubt it would be as simple as
disposing of a pair of Aes Sedai. I keep thinking what I would do
in Sammael&rsquo;s place. I would have Illian warded in boxes, so if
a man even thought of channeling, I&rsquo;d know right where he was,
and I would burn even the ground to ash before he had time to take
a breath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was how Rand saw it, too; no one knew better
than Sammael how to defend a place. Maybe it was just that Lews
Therin was insane. Maybe jealous, too. Rand tried to tell himself
he had not been avoiding the school because <em>he</em> was
jealous, but he always felt a prickle of something around Taim.
 &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve delivered your news. I suggest you go see to training
this Jahar Narishma. Train him well. He may have to use his ability
soon enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Taim&rsquo;s dark eyes glittered, then he
bowed his head slightly. Without a word he seized <em>saidin</em>
and opened a gateway right there. Rand made himself sit, empty,
until the man was gone, the gateway thinning in a blazing line of
light; he could not risk another struggle with Lews Therin, not
when he might lose and find himself fighting Taim. Why <em>did</em>
Lews Therin want the man dead? Light, Lews Therin seemed to want
everybody dead, himself included.</p>

<p>It had been a most eventful morning,
especially considering that the sky was still gray. Good news
outweighed bad. He eyed the Gray Man sprawled on the carpet; that
wound had probably been cauterized as soon as made, but Mistress
Harfor would be sure to let him know, without saying a word, if
there was even one bloodstain. As for this Sea Folk Wavemistress,
she could stew in her own petulance for all of him; he had enough
to handle without adding <em>another</em> touchy woman.</p>

<p>Nandera and Jalani were still shifting from foot to
foot near the door. They should have gone to their places outside
as soon as Taim left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you two are upset over the Gray Man,&rdquo; he said,
 &ldquo;forget it now. Only a fool expects to notice one of the Soulless
except by chance, and neither one of you is a fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not that,&rdquo; Nandera said stiffly. Jalani&rsquo;s
jaw was so tight she was plainly fighting to hold her tongue.</p>

<p>Just that quickly, he understood. They did not
believe they should have spotted the Gray Man, but they were still
ashamed they had not. Ashamed of that, and fearful of the shame of
having word of their &ldquo;failure&rdquo; spread. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anyone to
know Taim was here, or what he said. People are anxious enough
knowing the school is somewhere near the city without being afraid
Taim or one of the students will just appear. I think the best way
is just to keep quiet about everything that happened this morning.
We can&rsquo;t keep a corpse secret, but I want you to promise
you&rsquo;ll say nothing except that a man tried to kill me and died
for it. That&rsquo;s all I intend to tell anybody, and I&rsquo;d hate
for you to make me out a liar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gratitude on their faces was remarkable. &ldquo;I have
<em>toh</em>,&rdquo; they murmured almost together.</p>

<p>Rand cleared his throat roughly; that was not what he
had been after, but at least he had eased their minds. Suddenly a
way to deal with Sulin popped into his head. She would not like it,
but it would still be meeting her <em>toh</em>, maybe the more so
because she would not like it, and it would relieve his conscience
somewhat and at least meet some of his <em>toh</em> to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get on to your guarding now, or I&rsquo;ll start
thinking <em>you</em> want to stare at my eyebrows.&rdquo; That
<em>was</em> what Nandera had said. Aviendha was fascinated by his
<em>eyebrows</em>? &ldquo;Go on. And find somebody to haul this fellow
away.&rdquo; They left, all smiles and flickering handtalk, and he stood,
taking Aviendha by the arm. &ldquo;You said we had to talk. Come into the
bedroom until this room is cleaned up.&rdquo; If there was a stain, maybe
he could channel it out.</p>

<p>Aviendha jerked free. &ldquo;No! Not there!&rdquo; Drawing a deep
breath, she moderated her tone, but she still looked suspicious,
and more than a little angry. &ldquo;Why can we not talk here?&rdquo; No reason
except a dead man on the floor, but that did not count with her.
She pushed him back into his chair almost violently, then studied
him and took another breath before speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em> is the core of the Aiel.
We <em>are ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>. This morning you shamed me to
the bone.&rdquo; Folding her arms beneath her breasts and fixing him eye
to eye, she lectured him on his ignorance and the importance of
hiding it until she could rectify the matter, then went on to the
fact that <em>toh</em> had to be met at all costs. She spent some
time on that.</p>

<p>He was sure this was not what she had meant when she
said she had to talk with him, but he was enjoying looking into her
eyes too much to wonder. Enjoying it. Bit by bit he chased down the
pleasure her eyes gave him and crushed it until only a dull ache
remained.</p>

<p>He thought he had hidden it, but his face must have
changed. Aviendha slowly trailed off and stood there staring at
him, breathing hard. With a visible effort she pulled her eyes
away. &ldquo;At least you understand now,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;I must&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I
need to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;so long as you understand.&rdquo; Gathering her skirts, she
swept across the room&mdash;the corpse might as well have been a
bush she had to step around&mdash;and out.</p>

<p>Leaving him in a room dimmer for some reason, alone
with a dead man. That fit all too well. When
<em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> came to bear away the Gray Man, they found
Rand laughing softly.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Padan Fain sat with his feet up on a hassock,
studying the beauty of new-breaking sunlight glittering on the
curved blade of the dagger that he turned over and over in his
hands. Carrying it at his belt was not enough; from time to time he
simply had to handle it. The large ruby set in the pommel shone
with a deep malevolence. The dagger was part of him, or he of it.
The dagger was part of Aridhol, what men called Shadar Logoth, but
then, he was part of Aridhol too. Or it was part of him. He was
quite mad and knew it very well, but being mad, he did not care.
Sunlight gleamed on steel, steel more deadly now than any made at
Thakan&rsquo;dar.</p>

<p>A rustling caught his ear, and he glanced toward
where the Myrddraal sat waiting his pleasure on the far side of the
room. It did not try to meet his gaze; he had broken it of that
long since.</p>

<p>He tried to return to his contemplation of the blade,
to the perfect beauty of perfect death, the beauty of what Aridhol
had been and would be again, but the Myrddraal had broken his
concentration. Spoiled it. He very nearly went over and killed the
thing. Halfmen took a long time to die; how long if he used the
dagger? As if sensing his thoughts, it stirred again. No, it could
be useful still.</p>

<p>It was hard for him to concentrate on one thing for
long anyway. Except Rand al&rsquo;Thor, of course. He could feel
al&rsquo;Thor, could point to him, this close. Al&rsquo;Thor pulled
at him, pulled till it hurt. There was a difference lately, a
difference that had come suddenly, almost as if someone else had
suddenly taken a partial possession of al&rsquo;Thor, and in doing
so pushed away a part of Fain&rsquo;s own possession. No matter.
Al&rsquo;Thor belonged to him.</p>

<p>He wished he could feel al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s pain;
surely he had caused him pain at least. Pinpricks only so far, but
enough pinpricks would drain him dry. The Whitecloaks were set hard
against the <em>Dragon Reborn</em>. Fain&rsquo;s lips peeled back in
a sneer. Unlikely Niall would have ever supported al&rsquo;Thor any
more than Elaida would have, but it was best not to take too much
for granted with Rand bloody al&rsquo;Thor. Well, he had brushed
them both with what he carried from Aridhol; they might possibly
trust their own mothers, but never al&rsquo;Thor now.</p>

<p>The door burst open, and young Perwyn Belman burst
into the room pursued by his mother. Nan Belman was a handsome
woman, though Fain seldom noticed whether a woman was or not now, a
Darkfriend who had thought her oaths were just dabbling in
wickedness until Padan Fain appeared on her doorstep. She believed
him a Darkfriend too, one high in the councils. Fain had gone far
beyond that, of course; he would be dead the moment one of the
Chosen laid hands on him. The thought made him giggle.</p>

<p>Perwyn and his mother both shied at the sight of the
Myrddraal, of course, but the boy recovered first and reached Fain
while the woman was still trying to find her breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Mordeth, Master Mordeth,&rdquo; the boy piped,
dancing from foot to foot in his red-and-white coat, &ldquo;I have news
you wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mordeth. Had he used that name? Sometimes he could
not recall what name he had used, what name was his. Sheathing the
dagger beneath his coat, he put on a warm smile. &ldquo;And what news
would that be now, lad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Someone tried to kill the Dragon Reborn this
morning. A man. He&rsquo;s dead now. He got right past all the Aiel
and everything, right into the Lord Dragon&rsquo;s rooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fain felt his smile become a snarl. Trying to kill
al&rsquo;Thor? Al&rsquo;Thor was his! Al&rsquo;Thor would die by his
hand, no other! Wait. The assassin had gotten past the Aiel, into
al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s rooms? &ldquo;A Gray Man!&rdquo; He did not recognize that
grating sound as his own voice. Gray Men meant the Chosen. Would he
never be free of their interference?</p>

<p>All that rage had to go somewhere before he burst.
Almost casually he brushed his hand across the boy&rsquo;s face. The
boy&rsquo;s eyes bulged; he began trembling so hard his teeth
rattled.</p>

<p>Fain did not really understand the tricks he could
work. A bit of something from the Dark One, perhaps, a bit from
Aridhol. It had been after there, after he stopped being just Padan
Fain, that the ability began to manifest, slowly. All he knew was
that he could do certain things now, as long as he could touch what
he worked with.</p>

<p>Nan flung herself to her knees beside his chair,
clutching at his coat. &ldquo;Mercy, Master Mordeth,&rdquo; she panted.
 &ldquo;Please, have mercy. He&rsquo;s only a child. Only a child!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment he studied her curiously, head tilted.
She was quite a pretty woman, really. Planting a foot against her
chest, he shoved her aside so he could stand. The Myrddraal,
peeking furtively, jerked its eyeless face away when it saw him
watching. It remembered his&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;tricks very well.</p>

<p>Fain paced; he had to move. Al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s
downfall had to be his doing&mdash;his!&mdash;not the
Chosen&rsquo;s. How could he hurt the man again, hurt to the heart?
There were those nattering girls at Culain&rsquo;s Hound, but if
al&rsquo;Thor did not come when the Two Rivers was harrowed, what
would he care even if Fain burned the inn down and the chits with
it? What did he have to work with? Only a few remained of his
onetime Children of the Light. That had only been a test really&mdash;he would have made the man who actually managed to kill
al&rsquo;Thor beg to be skinned alive!&mdash;yet it had cost him
numbers. He had the Myrddraal, a handful of Trollocs hidden outside
the city, a few Darkfriends gathered in Caemlyn and on the way from
Tar Valon. The pull of al&rsquo;Thor dragged him on. It was the most
remarkable thing about Darkfriends. There should be nothing to
single out a Darkfriend from anyone else, but of late he found he
could tell one at a glance, even someone who had only thought of
swearing to the Shadow, as if they had a sooty mark on their
foreheads.</p>

<p>No! He had to concentrate. Concentrate! Clear his
mind. His eye fell on the woman, moaning and stroking her gibbering
son, talking to him softly as if that would help. Fain had no
notion how to stop one of his tricks once it began; the boy should
survive, if a trifle the worse for wear, once the thing ground to a
conclusion. Fain had not put his whole heart into making it. Clear
his mind. Think of something else. A pretty woman. How long since
he had had a woman?</p>

<p>Smiling, he took her arm. He had to pull her away
from the fool boy. &ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo; His voice was different,
grander, the Lugard accent gone, but he did not notice; he never
did. &ldquo;I am sure you, at least, know how to show true respect. If
you please me, no harm will come to you.&rdquo; Why was she struggling?
He knew he was being charming. He was going to have to hurt her. It
was all al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s fault.</p>
