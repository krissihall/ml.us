<h4><em>The Mirror of Mists</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">R</span>and
puffed contentedly on his pipe, sitting in his
shirtsleeves with his back against one of the slender white columns
that surrounded the small oval courtyard, and watched the water
spray up in the marble fountain, sparkling like gems in the
sunlight. The morning still left this part of the courtyard in
pleasant shade. Even Lews Therin was still. &ldquo;Are you sure you
won&rsquo;t reconsider Tear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seated against the next column and also coatless,
Perrin blew two smoke rings before replacing his pipe, a rather
ornate thing carved with wolfheads. &ldquo;What about what Min saw?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s attempt at his own ring ran afoul of a
sour grunt and came out just a puff of smoke. Min had had no right
to bring that up where Perrin could hear. &ldquo;Do you really want to be
tied to my belt, Perrin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I want hasn&rsquo;t seemed to count much since
the first time we saw Moiraine back in Emond&rsquo;s Field,&rdquo; Perrin
said dryly. He sighed. &ldquo;You are who you are, Rand. If you fail,
everything fails.&rdquo; Suddenly he sat forward, frowning toward a wide
doorway behind the columns to their left.</p>

<p>A long moment later Rand heard footsteps in that
direction, too heavy for any human. The broad shape that ducked
through the doorway and strode into the courtyard was more than
twice as tall as the serving woman who was almost running to keep
up with the Ogier&rsquo;s long legs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loial!&rdquo; Rand exclaimed, scrambling to his feet. He
and Perrin reached the Ogier together. The grin on Loial&rsquo;s
wide mouth really did almost split his huge face in two, but his
long coat, spreading out above turned-down knee-high boots, still
carried travel dust. The big pockets bulged with squarish shapes,
too; Loial was never far from books. &ldquo;Are you all right,
Loial?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look tired,&rdquo; Perrin said, urging the Ogier
toward the fountain. &ldquo;Sit on the coping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loial let himself be led, but his long dangling
eyebrows rose and tufted ears quivered in puzzlement as he stared
from one of them to the other. Sitting, he was as tall as Perrin
standing. &ldquo;All right? Tired?&rdquo; His voice was a rumble like the earth
moving. &ldquo;Of course I am all right. And if I&rsquo;m tired, I have
walked a long way. I must say it felt good to be back on my own
feet. You always know where your feet are taking you, but you never
can be sure with a horse. Anyway, my feet are faster.&rdquo; Abruptly he
let out a thunderous laugh. &ldquo;You owe me a gold crown, Perrin. You
and your ten days. I will wager another crown you&rsquo;ve not been
here more than five days before me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get your crown.&rdquo; Perrin laughed. In an
aside to Rand that had Loial&rsquo;s ears vibrating indignantly, he
added, &ldquo;Gaul corrupted him. He dices now, and bets on horse races
when he can barely tell one horse from another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand grinned. Loial always had looked at horses
rather dubiously, and small wonder since his legs were longer than
theirs. &ldquo;Are you sure you&rsquo;re all right, Loial?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you find that abandoned <em>stedding</em>?&rdquo;
Perrin asked around his pipestem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you stay long enough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you two talking about?&rdquo; Loial&rsquo;s
uncertain frown trailed the ends of his eyebrows down onto his
cheeks. &ldquo;I just wanted to see a <em>stedding</em> again, to feel
one. I am ready for ten more years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t what your mother says,&rdquo; Rand
said seriously.</p>

<p>Loial was on his feet before Rand finished, staring
wildly in every direction, ears laid back and trembling. &ldquo;My
mother? Here? She is here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Perrin said, and Loial&rsquo;s
ears almost went limp with relief. &ldquo;It seems she&rsquo;s in the Two
Rivers. Or was a month ago. Rand used some way of hopping about he
has to take her and Elder Haman&mdash;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Halfway to sitting down again, Loial froze with his
knees bent at Elder Haman&rsquo;s name. Eyes closed, he lowered
himself slowly the rest of the way. &ldquo;Elder Haman,&rdquo; he muttered,
rubbing his face with a thick-fingered hand. &ldquo;Elder Haman and my
mother.&rdquo; He peered at Perrin. He peered at Rand. In a voice that
was low and much too casual, he asked, &ldquo;Was anyone else with them?&rdquo;
Well, it was low for an Ogier; a giant bumblebee buzzing in a huge
waterjar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A young Ogier woman named Erith,&rdquo; Rand told him.
 &ldquo;You&mdash;&rdquo; That was as far as he got.</p>

<p>With a moan Loial leaped to his feet again.
Servants&rsquo; heads appeared at doorways and windows to see what
that vast noise was, and vanished again when they saw Rand. Loial
began pacing back and forth, ears and eyebrows both drooping so
much that he seemed to be melting. &ldquo;A wife,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;It cannot
mean anything else, not with Mother and Elder Haman. A wife.
I&rsquo;m too young to get married!&rdquo; Rand hid a smile behind his
hand; Loial might be young for an Ogier, but in his case that meant
more than ninety. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll drag me back to Stedding Shangtai. I
know she won&rsquo;t let me travel with you, and I still don&rsquo;t
have near enough notes for my book. Oh, you can smile, Perrin.
Faile does whatever you say.&rdquo; Perrin choked on his pipe, wheezing
until Rand slapped his back. &ldquo;It is different with us,&rdquo; Loial went
on. &ldquo;It is considered very rude not to do as your wife says. Very
rude. I know she&rsquo;ll make me settle down to something solid and
respectable, like treesinging or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Abruptly he frowned and
stopped pacing. &ldquo;Did you say Erith?&rdquo; Rand nodded; Perrin seemed to
be getting his breath back, but he was glaring at Loial in a sort
of malevolent amusement. &ldquo;Erith, daughter of Iva daughter of Alar?&rdquo;
Rand nodded again, and Loial sank back to his place on the fountain
coping. &ldquo;But I know her. You remember her, Rand. We met her at
Stedding Tsofu.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is what I was trying to tell you,&rdquo; Rand
said patiently. And with no little amusement himself. &ldquo;She was the
one who said you&rsquo;re handsome. And gave you a flower, as I
recall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She might have said,&rdquo; Loial muttered defensively.
 &ldquo;She might have done; I cannot recall.&rdquo; But one hand strayed toward
a coat pocket full of books, where Rand would have wagered anything
that flower was carefully pressed. The Ogier cleared his throat, a
deep rumble. &ldquo;Erith is very beautiful. I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone
so beautiful. And intelligent. She listened very attentively when I
explained Serden&rsquo;s theory&mdash;that is Serden, son of Kolom
son of Radlin; he wrote about six hundred years ago&mdash;when I
explained his theory of how the Ways&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He trailed off as if
he had just noticed their grins. &ldquo;Well, she did listen.
Attentively. She was very interested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she was,&rdquo; Rand said noncommittally.
Mention of the Ways made him think. Most of the Waygates were near
<em>stedding</em>, and if Loial&rsquo;s mother and Elder Haman were
to be believed, the <em>stedding</em> were what Loial needed. Of
course, he could not take Loial any closer than the edge of one;
you could not channel into a <em>stedding</em> any more than you
could channel inside one. &ldquo;Listen, Loial. I want to put guards on
all the Waygates, and I need somebody who can not only find them,
but can talk to the Elders as well and get their permission.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light,&rdquo; Perrin growled disgustedly. He tapped out
his pipe and ground the dottle into the courtyard paving stone
under his boot heel. &ldquo;Light! You send Mat off to face down Aes
Sedai, you want to dump me into the middle of a war with Sammael
and a few hundred Two Rivers men with me, some of them you know,
and now you want to send Loial off when he&rsquo;s only just
arrived. Burn you, Rand, look at him! He needs rest. Is there
anybody you won&rsquo;t use? Maybe you want Faile to go hunt
Moghedien or Semirhage. Light!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anger welled up in Rand, a tempest that made him
shake. Those yellow eyes stared at him grimly, but he stared back
like thunder. &ldquo;I will use anybody I must. You said it yourself; I
am who I am. And I&rsquo;m using myself up, Perrin, because I have
to. Just like I&rsquo;ll use anybody I have to. We don&rsquo;t have a
choice anymore. Not me, not you, not anybody!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand, Perrin,&rdquo; Loial murmured worriedly. &ldquo;Be still,
be calm. Don&rsquo;t fight. Not you.&rdquo; A hand the size of a ham
patted each of them awkwardly on the shoulder. &ldquo;You should both
rest in a <em>stedding</em>. The <em>stedding</em> are very
peaceful, very soothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared at Perrin staring at him. Anger still
flashed in him, lightning flashes in a storm that would not quite
die. Lews Therin&rsquo;s mutters rumbled fitfully, far off.
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he muttered, meaning it for both.</p>

<p>Perrin made an offhand gesture, maybe meaning there
was nothing to apologize for, maybe accepting the apology, but he
did not offer one himself. Instead his head swung toward the
columns again, toward the door Loial had come through. Once more
moments passed before Rand heard running footsteps.</p>

<p>Min dashed into the courtyard at a dead run. Ignoring
Loial and Perrin, she seized Rand&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
coming,&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;They are on their way right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy, Min,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Calm yourself. I was
beginning to think they were all taking to their beds like&mdash;what did you say her name is? Demira?&rdquo; In truth, he felt
considerable relief, though Lews Therin&rsquo;s grumbling and
wheezing laughter grew louder with the mention of Aes Sedai. For
three days Merana had appeared with two sisters each afternoon as
regular as the finest clockmaker&rsquo;s art, but the visits had
suddenly stopped five days ago without a word of explanation. Min
had no idea why. He had been worried that they had taken offense
enough at his rules to leave.</p>

<p>But Min stared up at him with a face of anguish. She
was trembling, he realized. &ldquo;Listen to me! It is seven of them, not
three, and they didn&rsquo;t send me to ask permission or let you
know or anything. I slipped out ahead of them, and galloped
Wildrose the whole way. They mean to be inside the Palace before
you know they&rsquo;re here. I heard Merana talking to Demira when
they didn&rsquo;t know I was there. They mean to reach the Grand
Hall ahead of you, so you have to come to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this your viewing, do you think?&rdquo; he asked
calmly. Women who could channel would hurt him badly, she had said.
Seven! Lews Therin whispered hoarsely. <em>No! No! No!</em> Rand
ignored him; there was little else he could do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Min said in an agonized voice.
Rand was startled to realize the shine in her dark eyes came from
unshed tears. &ldquo;Do you think I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you if I knew? All
I know is they are coming, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there is nothing to be afraid of,&rdquo; he broke in
firmly. The Aes Sedai must really have frightened her for Min to be
near crying. <em>Seven</em>, Lews Therin groaned. <em>I cannot
handle seven, not at once. Not seven</em>. Rand thought of the
fat-little-man <em>angreal</em>, and the voice faded to murmurs; it
still sounded uneasy, though. At least Alanna was not one of them;
Rand could feel her at some distance, not moving, certainly not
toward him. He was not sure he dared come face-to-face with her
again. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time to waste, either. Jalani?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The plump-cheeked young Maiden popped out from behind
a column so suddenly that Loial&rsquo;s ears shot straight up. Min
seemed to see the Ogier for the first time, and Perrin; she gave a
start too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jalani,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;tell Nandera I am going to the
Grand Hall, where I expect Aes Sedai shortly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tried to maintain a smooth face, but the
beginnings of a self-satisfied grin made her cheeks seem even
plumper. &ldquo;Beralna has already gone to inform Nandera, <em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>.&rdquo; Loial&rsquo;s ears flickered in surprise
at the title.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then would you tell Sulin to meet me at the dressing
rooms behind the Grand Hall with my coat? And the Dragon
Scepter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jalani&rsquo;s grin widened openly. &ldquo;Sulin has already
gone running in her wetlander dress as fast as a gray-nosed hare
that sat on <em>segade</em> spines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;you can bring my horse to
the Grand Hall.&rdquo; The young Maiden&rsquo;s jaw dropped, especially
when Perrin and Loial doubled over laughing.</p>

<p>Min&rsquo;s fist in Rand&rsquo;s shortribs made him
grunt. &ldquo;This is no joking matter, you thick-skulled sheepfarmer!
Merana and the rest were wrapping themselves in their shawls as
though putting on armor. Now, listen to me. I will stand over to
one side, behind the columns, so you can see and they cannot, and
if I see anything, I&rsquo;ll make some sort of signal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will stay here with Loial and Perrin,&rdquo; he told
her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what kind of signal you could make that
I&rsquo;d understand, and if they catch even a glimpse of you, they
will know you warned me.&rdquo; She gave him one of those fists-on-hips,
glaring-up-through-her-eyelashes, sullen stubborn stares.
 &ldquo;Min?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To his surprise, she sighed and said, &ldquo;Yes, Rand,&rdquo;
just as meek as milkwater. That sort of thing from her made him as
suspicious as it would have from Elayne or Aviendha, but he had no
time for digging if he was to be in the Grand Hall before Merana.
Nodding, he hoped he did not look as uncertain as he felt.</p>

<p>Wondering whether he should have asked Perrin and
Loial to keep her there&mdash;she would have loved that&mdash;he
trotted all the way to the dressing rooms behind the Grand Hall
with Jalani at his heels muttering about whether the horse had been
a joke. Sulin was already there with a gold-embroidered red coat
and the Dragon Scepter; the spearhead got an approving grunt,
though no doubt she would have found it more acceptable without the
green-and-white tassel and with a proper length of shaft and no
carvings. Rand felt to be sure the <em>angreal</em> was in the
pocket. It was, and he breathed more easily, though Lews Therin
still seemed to be panting anxiously.</p>

<p>When Rand hurried through one of the lion-paneled
dressing rooms into the Grand Hall, he discovered that everyone had
been as quick as Sulin. Bael towered at one side of the throne dais
with his arms folded, while Melaine stood on the other, calmly
adjusting her dark shawl. What must have been a hundred or more
Maidens lined the way from the doors on one knee, under
Nandera&rsquo;s watchful gaze, complete with spears and bucklers,
horn bows cased on their backs and full quivers at their hips. Only
their eyes showed above black veils. Jalani ran to join one of
those lines. Behind them more Aiel crowded among the thick columns,
men and Maidens, though none appeared armed beyond their
heavy-bladed knives. There were a number of grim faces, though.
They could not be enjoying the thought of a confrontation with Aes
Sedai, and not for fear of the Power. However Melaine and the other
Wise Ones might speak of them now, most Aiel had that ancient
failure of the Aiel firmly fixed in their heads.</p>

<p>Bashere was not there, of course&mdash;he and his
wife were out at one of Bashere&rsquo;s training camps&mdash;and
neither were any of the Andoran nobles who flocked around the
Palace. Rand was sure that Naean and Elenia and Lir and that entire
lot would have learned of this gathering as soon as it began. They
never missed an audience from the throne unless he sent them away.
Their absence could only mean that on their way to the Grand Hall,
they had learned the reason too, and that meant the Aes Sedai were
already in the Palace.</p>

<p>Indeed, Rand had no sooner seated himself on the
Dragon Throne with the Dragon Scepter on his knee than Mistress
Harfor scurried into the Grand Hall looking flustered, quite
unusual for her. Staring at him and all the Aiel with equal
amazement, she said, &ldquo;I sent servants everywhere to find you.
There are Aes Sedai&mdash;&rdquo; That was as far as she got before
seven Aes Sedai appeared in the wide doorway.</p>

<p>Rand felt Lews Therin reaching for <em>saidin</em>,
touching the <em>angreal</em>, but Rand took hold of it himself,
holding that raging torrent of fire and ice, filth and sweetness,
as hard as he did the piece of Seanchan spear.</p>

<p><em>Seven</em>, Lews Therin mumbled darkly. <em>I
told them three, and seven come. I must be cautious. Yes.
Cautious</em>.</p>

<p>I <em>said three</em>, Rand snapped back at the
voice. <em>Me! Rand al&rsquo;Thor!</em> Lews Therin fell silent, but
then the distant muttering began again.</p>

<p>Glancing from Rand to the seven women in their
fringed shawls, Mistress Harfor apparently decided between was no
place to be. The Aes Sedai received her first curtsy, Rand the
second, and she walked with a good show of calm to one side of the
doorway. When the Aes Sedai entered, though, forming a line
abreast, she did slip out behind them with just a touch of
haste.</p>

<p>On each of her three visits Merana had brought
different Aes Sedai, and Rand recognized all but one of these, from
Faeldrin Harella on the right, her dark hair in a multitude of thin
braids worked with brightly colored beads, to stout Valinde
Nathenos on the left in her white-fringed shawl and white dress.
They were all clothed in their Ajah colors. He knew who the one he
did not recognize must be. That coppery skin made the gracefully
beautiful woman in dark bronze silk Demira Eriff, the Brown sister
who Min had reported had taken to her bed. But she stood in the
center of the line, a pace ahead of the others, while Merana stood
between Faeldrin and plump, round-faced Rafela Cindal, who looked
even more serious today than she had when he saw her with Merana
six days ago. They all looked very serious.</p>

<p>For one moment they paused, looking at him
impassively, ignoring the Aiel; then they glided forward, first
Demira, then Seonid and Rafela, then Merana and Masuri, forming an
arrowhead pointed straight at Rand. He did not need the faint
tingle in his skin to tell him they had embraced <em>saidar</em>.
With every step each woman appeared noticeably taller than
before.</p>

<p><em>They think to impress me spinning the Mirror of
Mists?</em> Lews Therin&rsquo;s incredulous laugh faded into mad
giggles. Rand did not need the man&rsquo;s explanation; he had seen
Moiraine do something like this once. Asmodean had called it the
Mirror of Mists too, and also Illusion.</p>

<p>Melaine shifted her shawl irritably and sniffed
loudly, but Bael suddenly looked as if he were facing, all alone, a
charge by hundreds. He meant to stand against it, but he did not
expect any good outcome. For that matter, some of the Maidens
stirred until Nandera glared at them over her veil, and that did
not stop the soft sound of shifting feet from the Aiel among the
columns.</p>

<p>Demira Eriff began to speak, and plainly channeling
was involved there too. She did not shout, but her voice filled the
Grand Hall, seeming to come from everywhere. &ldquo;Under the
circumstances, it was decided that I should speak for all. We
intend you no harm here today, but the strictures we accepted
before, that you would feel safe, we must now reject. Obviously you
have never learned the respect due Aes Sedai. You must learn it
now. Henceforth we shall come and go as we please, saving only that
at our choice, we will still inform you first in the future when we
wish to speak with you. Your Aiel watchers around our inn must be
removed, and no one is to watch or follow us. Any future insult to
our dignity will be punished, though those we must punish are as
children, and you will be responsible for their pain. This is how
it must be. This is how it shall be. Know that we are Aes
Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As that long arrowhead halted before the throne, Rand
noticed Melaine glancing at him, frowning, no doubt wondering
whether he was impressed. If he had not some notion of what was
happening, he would have been; he was not sure he was not anyway.
The seven Aes Sedai stood twice as tall as Loial, maybe more, heads
nearly halfway to the vaulted ceiling with its colored-glass
windows. Demira gazed down at him, cool and dispassionate, as if
she might be contemplating picking him up in one hand, which she
appeared big enough to do.</p>

<p>Rand made himself lean back casually, his mouth
tightening when he realized that it had taken an effort, if not
very great. Lews Therin chittered and screamed, but in the
distance, something about not waiting, striking now. She had laid
emphasis on certain words, as if he should understand the
significance. Under what circumstances? They had accepted the
restrictions before; why were they suddenly a breach of respect?
Why did they suddenly decide that far from needing to make him feel
safe, they could threaten? &ldquo;The Tower emissaries in Cairhien accept
the same constraints as you and do not seem offended.&rdquo; Well, not
very offended. &ldquo;Instead of vague threats, they offer gifts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are not us. They are not here. We will not buy
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The contempt in Demira&rsquo;s voice stung.
Rand&rsquo;s knuckles ached from his grip on the Dragon Scepter. His
anger had an echo from Lews Therin, and suddenly he realized the
man was struggling again to reach the Source.</p>

<p><em>Burn you!</em> Rand thought. He meant to shield
them, but Lews Therin spoke, panting in near panic.</p>

<p><em>Not strong enough. Even with the </em>angreal<em>, maybe
not strong enough, not to hold seven. You fool! You waited too
long! Too dangerous!</em></p>

<p>Shielding anyone did take a fair amount of strength.
With the <em>angreal</em>, Rand was sure he could make seven
shields, even with them embracing <em>saidar</em> already; but if
even one could break that shield&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;or more than one. He wanted
to impress them with his strength, not give them a chance to
overcome it. But there was another way. Weaving Spirit, Fire and
Earth just so, he struck almost as if intending to shield.</p>

<p>Their Mirror of Mists shattered. Suddenly there were
only seven normal women standing in front of him with stunned
faces. Shock vanished behind Aes Sedai tranquility in an instant,
however.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have heard our requirements,&rdquo; Demira said in a
normal voice, but a commanding one, just as if nothing had happened
at all. &ldquo;We expect them to be met.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stared in spite of himself. What did he have to
do to show them he would not be browbeaten? <em>Saidin</em> raged
in him, a boiling fury. He did not dare release it. Lews Therin was
screaming maniacally now, trying to claw the Source out of his
grip. It was all he could do to hold on. Slowly he stood. With the
extra height of the dais, he towered over them. Seven unruffled Aes
Sedai faces looked up at him. &ldquo;The restrictions stand,&rdquo; he said
quietly. &ldquo;And one more requirement of my own. From now on I expect
to see the respect I deserve from you. I am the Dragon Reborn. You
may go now. The audience is at an end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For perhaps ten heartbeats they stood there, not even
blinking, as though to show they would not move a single slipper at
his command. Then Demira turned without so much as a nod of her
head. As she passed Seonid and Rafela, they fell in behind her, and
the others in turn, all gliding smoothly, without hurry, across the
red and white tiles and out of the Grand Hall.</p>

<p>Rand stepped down from the dais as they vanished into
the corridor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> handled them
well,&rdquo; Melaine said, loudly enough to be heard in every corner.
 &ldquo;They must be taken by the scruff of the neck and taught honor
though they weep for it.&rdquo; Bael did not quite manage to hide his
discomfort, hearing Aes Sedai spoken of so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is the way to handle Wise Ones too?&rdquo; Rand
asked, managing a smile.</p>

<p>Melaine lowered her voice, shifting her shawl
emphatically. &ldquo;Do not be a complete fool, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bael chuckled, though his wife glared at him. At
least he had brought a chuckle. Rand did not feel the humor of the
small joke, though, and not because of the buffering of the Void.
He almost wished he had let Min come. There were too many
undercurrents here he could not understand, and he was afraid there
were some he did not even see. What were they really after?</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Closing the small door of the dressing room, Min
leaned back against a dark lion-carved wall panel and drew a very
deep breath. Faile had come for Perrin, and however much Loial had
protested that Rand wanted her to stay there, he had crumpled
before the simple truth that Rand had no right to make her stay
anywhere. Of course, if Loial had had any idea what she intended,
he might have tucked her under his arm&mdash;quite gently, of
course&mdash;and sat there in the courtyard reading to her.</p>

<p>The thing was, while she had heard everything, she
had not seen very much, aside from Aes Sedai towering over throne
and dais. They must have been channeling, which did tend to obscure
the images and auras, but she had been so astounded she would not
have noticed had any been present. By the time she recovered, they
were no longer towering, and Demira&rsquo;s voice no longer boomed
from every angle.</p>

<p>Chewing her underlip, she thought furiously. There
were two problems, as she saw it. First, Rand and his demands for
respect, whatever he meant by that. If he expected Merana to curtsy
with her head to the floor, he was going to have a long wait, and
in the meantime, he had surely put their backs up. There had to be
some way she could smooth that over, if she could just see how. The
second problem was the Aes Sedai. Rand seemed to think this was
some sort of snit that he could end by putting his foot down. Min
was not certain Aes Sedai had snits, but if they did, she was sure
this was something more serious. The only place to find out,
though, was The Crown of Roses.</p>

<p>Reclaiming Wildrose at the forecourt stable, she
trotted the bay mare back to the inn and handed her over to a
big-eared stableman with a request that the horse be rubbed down
well and fed some oats. Her gallop to the Palace had been just
that, and Wildrose deserved a reward for helping spike Merana and
the others&rsquo; scheme. From the cold fury in Rand&rsquo;s voice,
she was not certain what would have happened had he suddenly
learned out of a clear sky that seven Aes Sedai were awaiting him
in the Grand Hall.</p>

<p>The common room of The Crown of Roses looked almost
the same as when she had scuttled out through the kitchens earlier.
Warders sat about at the tables, some playing dominoes or stones,
others tossing dice. Almost as one they glanced up as she entered,
and, recognizing her, went back to what they were doing. Mistress
Cinchonine was standing in front of the wine-room door&mdash;no
barrels of ale and wine stacked along the common-room wall in The
Crown of Roses&mdash;with her arms folded and a sour expression on
her face. The Warders were the only ones at the tables, and as a
rule, Warders drank little and seldom. Any number of pewter mugs
and cups stood on tables, but Min did not see one of them touched.
She did see a man who might be willing to tell her a little.</p>

<p>Mahiro Shukosa sat at a table by himself working
tavern puzzles, the two swords he usually wore on his back propped
against the wall in easy reach. With graying temples and a noble
nose, Mahiro was handsome in a rugged sort of way, though certainly
only a woman in love would have called him beautiful. In Kandor he
was a lord. He had visited the courts of almost every land,
traveled with a small library, and won or lost gambling with the
same easy smile. He could recite poetry and play the harp and dance
like a dream. In short, except for being Rafela&rsquo;s Warder, he
was exactly the sort of man she had liked before meeting Rand.
Still liked, actually, when she could see them for thinking about
Rand. Whether fortunately or unfortunately, Mahiro saw her in a way
Min suspected might be peculiar to Kandor, as a sort of younger
sister who occasionally needed someone to talk to and a little
advice so she would not break her neck while sowing her wild oats.
He told her she had pretty legs, would never think of touching
them, and would break the neck of any man who did think of it
without her permission.</p>

<p>Deftly slipping the intricate iron pieces back
together, he placed the puzzle on a stack of those already worked
and took up one from another stack as she sat down across from him.
 &ldquo;So, cabbage,&rdquo; he said with a grin, &ldquo;back with your neck unbroken,
not kidnapped and not married.&rdquo; One day she was going to ask him
what that meant; he always said it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has anything happened since I went out, Mahiro?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean aside from the sisters returning from the
Palace looking like a storm in the mountains.&rdquo; As usual, the puzzle
came apart in his hands as though channeled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What upset them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Al&rsquo;Thor, I suppose.&rdquo; The puzzle went back
together just as easily and joined the pile of discards;
immediately one from the other pile did, too. &ldquo;I worked that one
years ago,&rdquo; he confided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how, Mahiro? What happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dark eyes regarded her; a leopard&rsquo;s eyes would
look like Mahiro&rsquo;s if they were nearly black. &ldquo;Min, a yearling
who puts her nose into the wrong den may have her ears bitten
off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min winced. All too true. The fool things a woman did
because she was in love. &ldquo;That is what I would like to avoid,
Mahiro. The only reason I&rsquo;m here is to carry messages back and
forth between Merana and the Palace, but I walk in there with no
idea what I&rsquo;m walking into. I don&rsquo;t know why the sisters
stopped meeting him every day, or why they started back, or why a
whole fistful went today instead of just three. I could get more
than my ears bitten, not knowing. Merana isn&rsquo;t going to tell
me. She doesn&rsquo;t tell me anything except go there, do that.
Just a hint, Mahiro? Please?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He began studying the puzzle, yet she knew he was
thinking, because the interlocked pieces shifted about in his long
fingers but nothing came loose.</p>

<p>A motion at the back of the common room caught her
eye and she half-turned her head before her neck froze. Two Aes
Sedai were coming back from the baths, by the freshly washed look
of them, The last time she had seen that pair was months ago,
before they were sent out from Salidar because Sheriam had a hunch
Rand was in the Aiel waste somewhere. That was where Bera Harkin
and Kiruna Nachiman had been headed; the Waste, not Caemlyn.</p>

<p>Except for her ageless face, Bera would have looked
like a farmwife with her brown hair cut close around a square face,
but at the moment that face was set in grim determination. Kiruna,
elegant and statuesque, seemed every inch exactly what she was,
sister to the King of Arafel and a powerful lady in her own right.
Her large dark eyes gleamed as if she was about to order an
execution and enjoy it. Images and auras flickered about them as
always around Aes Sedai and Warders. One caught Min&rsquo;s eye when
it flashed around both women at the same instant, brownish yellow
and deep purple. The colors themselves meant nothing, but that aura
made Min stop breathing.</p>

<p>The table was not far from the foot of the stairs,
but the two women did not glance at Min as they turned to climb.
Neither had ever given her more than two looks in Salidar, and now
they were engrossed in their own conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alanna should have brought him to heel long since.&rdquo;
Kiruna&rsquo;s voice was low, yet close to open anger. &ldquo;I would
have. When she arrives, I will tell her so, and the Dark One take
convention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He should be leashed,&rdquo; Bera agreed in a flat tone,
 &ldquo;and before he can do more damage to Andor.&rdquo; She was Andoran. &ldquo;The
sooner, the better, I say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the pair sailed up the stairs, Min realized Mahiro
was looking at her. &ldquo;How did they get here?&rdquo; she asked, and was
surprised her voice sounded perfectly ordinary. Kiruna and Bera
made thirteen. Thirteen Aes Sedai. And there was that aura.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They followed word of al&rsquo;Thor. They were
halfway to Cairhien when they heard he was here. I would walk wide
of them, Min. Their Gaidin tell me neither is in a good temper.&rdquo;
Kiruna had four Warders, and Bera three.</p>

<p>Min managed a smile. She wanted to dart out of the
inn, but that would raise all sorts of suspicions, even in Mahiro.
 &ldquo;That sounds good advice. What about my hint?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hesitated another moment, then set the puzzle
down. &ldquo;I will not say what is or is not, but a word in a good ear.
Maybe you should expect al&rsquo;Thor to be upset. Maybe you should
even consider asking if someone else can deliver any messages,
perhaps one of us.&rdquo; He meant the Warders. &ldquo;Maybe the sisters have
decided to teach al&rsquo;Thor a small lesson in humility. And that,
cabbage, is maybe a word more than I should have said. You will
think on it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min did not know whether the &ldquo;small lesson&rdquo; was what
had happened at the Palace or something to come, but it all fit
together. And that aura. &ldquo;That sounds good advice too. Mahiro, if
Merana comes looking for me to carry a message, will you tell her I
am looking at the sights in the Inner City for the next few
days?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A long journey,&rdquo; he chuckled, gently mocking. &ldquo;You
will kidnap a husband yet if you are not careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The big-eared hostler stared when Min insisted he
root Wildrose out of her stall and saddle her again. She rode out
of the stableyard at a walk, but as soon as the first turning hid
The Crown of Roses, Min dug her heels and sent people leaping from
her path as she galloped toward the Palace as fast as Wildrose
could carry her.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop"> &ldquo;Thirteen,&rdquo; Rand said flatly, and just saying it was
enough for Lews Therin to try seizing control of <em>saidin</em>
from him again. It was a wordless struggle with a snarling beast.
When Min first said there actually were thirteen Aes Sedai in
Caemlyn, Rand had barely managed to seize the Power before Lews
Therin could. Sweat rolled down Rand&rsquo;s face; there were dark
patches on his coat. He only had room for concentrating on one
thing. Keeping <em>saidin</em> away from Lews Therin. A muscle in
his cheek jumped from the strain. His right hand trembled.</p>

<p>Min stopped pacing across his sitting-room carpet,
and bounced on her toes. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t only that, Rand,&rdquo; she said
frantically. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the aura. Blood, death, the One Power,
those two women and you, all in the same place at the same time.&rdquo;
Her eyes were shining again, but this time tears leaked silently
down her cheeks. &ldquo;Kiruna and Bera do not like you, not at all!
Remember what I saw around you? Women who can channel, hurting you.
It is the auras, and the thirteen, and everything, Rand. It is too
much!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She always said her viewing always came true, though
she could never tell whether in a day or a year or ten, and if he
remained in Caemlyn, he thought it might be the day. Even with only
a snarling in his head to go on, he knew Lews Therin wanted to
strike at Merana and the others before they could strike at him.
For that matter, the idea appealed uncomfortably to Rand. Maybe it
was only happenstance, maybe his <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> twisting of
chance had worked against him, but the fact remained. Merana had
decided to challenge him on the very day the number of Aes Sedai
reached thirteen.</p>

<p>Rising, he strode into his bedchamber long enough to
fetch his sword from the back of the wardrobe and fasten the
Dragon-shaped buckle. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming with me, Min,&rdquo; he told
her as he snatched up the Dragon Scepter and headed for the
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coming where?&rdquo; she demanded, wiping her cheeks with
a handkerchief, but she did follow, and he was already in the
hallway. Jalani bounced to her feet a touch more quickly than
Beralna, a bony redhead with blue eyes and a feral grin.</p>

<p>With none but Maidens about, Beralna would stare at
him as though considering whether to do him the great favor of
doing as he asked, but he gave her a sharp stare of his own. The
Void made his voice distant and cold. Lews Therin had subsided to
muted whimpers, but Rand dared not relax. Not in Caemlyn; not
anywhere near Caemlyn. &ldquo;Beralna, find Nandera and tell her to meet
me in Perrin&rsquo;s rooms with however many Maidens she wants to
take.&rdquo; He could not leave Perrin behind, and not because of any
viewing; when Merana found Rand gone, one of them might well bond
Perrin the way Alanna had him. &ldquo;I may not be coming back here. If
anyone sees Perrin or Faile or Loial, tell them to meet me there
too. Jalani, find Mistress Harfor. Tell her I need pen and ink and
paper.&rdquo; He had letters to write before he left. His hand trembled
again, and he added, &ldquo;Lots of paper. Well? Go! Go!&rdquo; They exchanged
one look, and went at a run. He headed in the opposite direction,
with Min almost trotting to keep up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand, where are we going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cairhien.&rdquo; With the Void around him, that came out
cold as a slap in the face. &ldquo;Trust me, Min. I won&rsquo;t hurt you.
I will cut off my arm before I hurt you.&rdquo; She was silent, and he
finally looked down to find her peering up at him with a strange
expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very nice to hear, sheepherder.&rdquo; Her
voice was as odd as her face. The thought of thirteen Aes Sedai
coming for him must have really frightened her, and small
wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Min, if it comes down to facing them, I promise to
send you away out of danger somehow.&rdquo; How could any man face
thirteen? The thought made Lews Therin surge again, screaming.</p>

<p>To his surprise, she flourished those knives out of
her coatsleeves and opened her mouth, but then slid the blades back
just as smoothly&mdash;she must have been practicing&mdash;before
she spoke. &ldquo;You can lead me by the nose to Cairhien or anywhere
else, sheepherder, but you better dig deep and try hard if you
think to send me anywhere at all.&rdquo; For some reason, he was sure
that was not what she had been going to say.</p>

<p>When they reached Perrin&rsquo;s rooms, Rand found
quite a gathering. At one side of the sitting room Perrin and Loial
were in shirtsleeves, cross-legged on the blue carpet and smoking
their pipes with Gaul, a Stone Dog Rand remembered from the fall of
the Stone. On the other side of the room sat Faile, also on the
floor, with Bain and Chiad, who had also been at the Stone. Through
the open door to the other room, Rand could see Sulin changing bed
linens, flinging them about as though she would rather rip them to
shreds. Everyone looked up when he and Min entered, and Sulin came
to the bedchamber door.</p>

<p>There was a good bit of scrambling about once he
explained about the thirteen Aes Sedai and what Min had overheard.
Not the viewings, though; some in the room knew, some might not,
and he was not going to tell anyone unless she did. Which she did
not. And not about Lews Therin, of course; not that he was afraid
of what might happen to him in a city with thirteen Aes Sedai even
if they sat on their hands. Let them think he was panicky if they
wished; he was not sure he was not. Lews Therin had gone silent,
but Rand could feel him, like heated eyes watching in the night.
Anger and fear, and maybe panic too, crawled outside the Void like
large spiders.</p>

<p>Perrin and Faile immediately began a hasty packing,
and Bain and Chiad flickered fingers at one another before
announcing that they meant to accompany Faile, whereupon Gaul
announced that he was accompanying Perrin. Rand did not understand
what was going on there, but it involved a great deal of Gaul not
looking at Bain or Chiad and them not looking at him. Loial went
running off, muttering under his breath, as he thought about
Cairhien being much farther from the Two Rivers than Caemlyn and
his Mother being a famous walker. When he returned, he had a
half-done bundle under one arm and huge saddlebags over his
shoulder, shirts hanging out. Loial was ready to go on the spot.
Sulin vanished as well, coming back with a bundle in her arms that
seemed made out of red-and-white dresses. With her face fixed in
that incongruous mildness, she growled at Rand that she had been
commanded to serve him and Perrin and Faile, and only a sun-crazed
lizard would think she could do that in Caemlyn when they were all
in Cairhien. She even added a &ldquo;my Lord Dragon&rdquo; that sounded a
curse, and a curtsy, amazingly without a single wobble. The latter
seemed to amaze her too.</p>

<p>Nandera arrived at almost the same instant as
Mistress Harfor, who was carrying a writing case with several
steel-nibbed pens and enough paper and ink and sealing wax for
fifty letters. Which turned out to be fortunate.</p>

<p>Perrin wanted to send word to Dannil Lewin telling
him to follow with the rest of the Two Rivers men&mdash;he did not
intend to leave any of them for the Aes Sedai, either&mdash;and he
only refrained from telling Dannil to bring Bode and the other
girls from Culain&rsquo;s Hound when both Rand and Faile pointed out
that in the first place, the Aes Sedai were not going to let them
go, and in the second, it was not very likely they would want to.
Perrin and she had both been to the inn more than once, and even
Perrin had to admit that the girls mainly seemed impatient to get
on with becoming Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>Faile herself had two hasty letters to write, to her
mother and father, so they would not worry, she said. Rand did not
know which was which, but they were very different in tone, the one
begun half a dozen times then torn up, and every word frowned over,
the other dashed off with smiles and chuckles. He thought that must
be to her mother. Min wrote to a friend named Mahiro at The Crown
of Roses, and for some reason made a point of telling Rand he was
an old man, though she blushed at saying it. Even Loial took pen in
hand after some hesitation. His own pen; a human pen would have
vanished in his huge hands. Sealing his note, he handed it to
Mistress Harfor with a diffident request that she deliver it
personally if the chance arose. A thumb the size of a fat sausage
covered most of the recipient&rsquo;s name, in both human script and
Ogier, but with the One Power sharpening his eyes, Rand noticed the
name &ldquo;Erith.&rdquo; Still, he showed no sign of wanting to wait and give
it to her himself.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s own letters were as difficult as
Faile&rsquo;s, but for different reasons. Sweat dripping from his
face made the ink run, and his hand shook so that he had to start
over more than once for ink-blots. He knew exactly what he wanted
to say, though. To Taim, a warning about thirteen Aes Sedai and a
reiteration of his orders to stay away from them. And to Merana, a
different sort of warning, and an invitation of a kind; it was no
use him trying to hide; Alanna could find him anywhere in the world
eventually. It had to be on his terms, though, if he could manage
that.</p>

<p>When he finally sealed them&mdash;the presence of a
greenstone seal carved with a Dragon earned Mistress Harfor a
stare, which she returned with the utmost blandness&mdash;Rand
turned to Nandera. &ldquo;Do you have your twenty Maidens outside?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nandera&rsquo;s eyebrows rose. &ldquo;Twenty? Your message
said however many I wanted, and that you might not return. I have
five hundred, and would have more had I not drawn the line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He only nodded. In his head was silence except for
his own thoughts, but he could <em>feel</em> Lews Therin, inside
the Void with him, waiting like a coiled spring. Not until he had
passed everyone through the gateway to the chamber in Cairhien and
let the hole close, cutting his sense of Alanna to that vague
impression of somewhere west, not until then did Lews Therin seem
to go away. It was as if, wearied by grappling with Rand, the man
had gone to sleep. At last Rand pushed <em>saidin</em> away, and
with that he realized how wearied he had been by the struggle.
Loial had to carry him to his rooms in the Sun Palace.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Merana sat quietly by the sitting-room window, her
back to the view of the street and Rand al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s letter
on her lap. She knew its contents by heart.</p>

<p>Merana, it began. Not Merana Aes Sedai, nor even
Merana Sedai.</p>

<p class="note">Merana,</p>

<p class="note">A friend of mine once told me that in most dice
games, the number thirteen is considered nearly as unlucky as
rolling the Dark One&rsquo;s Eyes. I also think thirteen is an
unlucky number. I am going to Cairhien. You may follow me as you
can with no more than five other sisters. That way you will be on
an equal footing with the emissaries from the White Tower. I will
be displeased if you try to bring more. Do not press me again. I
have little trust left in me.</p>

<p class="note_sig"><em>Rand al&rsquo;Thor<br>
 The Dragon Reborn</em></p>

<p>At the end, his pen had pressed so hard that it
nearly tore the paper; the last two lines almost seemed a different
hand from the rest.</p>

<p>Merana sat very quietly. She was not alone. The rest
of the embassy, if it could still be called that, sat in chairs
around the walls, in various states. Irritatingly, only Berenicia
sat as small as Merana, plump hands folded in her lap, head bowed
slightly and grave eyes watchful; she did not say a word unless
spoken to. Faeldrin sat quite proudly and spoke when she wished,
and so did Masuri and Rafela. For that matter, Seonid appeared
scarcely less eager, sitting on the edge of her chair and often
smiling determinedly. The rest were more like Valinde, almost
placid. Everyone was there except Verin and Alanna, and Gaidin had
been sent to find them. Kiruna and Bera, standing in the middle of
the floor, were most definitely there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That anyone could send such a letter to Aes Sedai
disgusts me.&rdquo; Kiruna did not thunder; her voice managed to be cool
and calm and forceful all at once. But her dark eyes did provide
lightning. &ldquo;Demira, can your informant confirm that al&rsquo;Thor
has gone to Cairhien?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Traveling,&rdquo; Bera murmured in disbelief. &ldquo;To think
that he would rediscover that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bright beads in Faeldrin&rsquo;s braids clicked as
she nodded. &ldquo;We can think of no other thing it can be. It will be
well to remember that he is perhaps more powerful even than Logain,
or Mazrim Taim, yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can nothing be done about Taim?&rdquo; Rafela&rsquo;s round
face, normally mild and pleasant, was quite stern, and her usually
sweet voice flat. &ldquo;There are at least one hundred men who can
channel&mdash;one hundred!&mdash;not twenty miles from where we
sit.&rdquo; Kairen nodded resolutely but did not speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must wait,&rdquo; Kiruna said firmly. &ldquo;Light and
honor, I do not know how many sisters will be required to handle so
many. Al&rsquo;Thor is the important matter, and one we can handle.
Demira?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Demira had waited for the others to finish, of
course. With a slight bow of her head, she said, &ldquo;I know only that
he is gone, apparently with a large number of Aiel, and possibly
with Perrin Aybara as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verin had slipped into the room as Demira began, and
she added, &ldquo;There can be no doubt of Perrin. I sent Tomas to look
at the Two Rivers men&rsquo;s camp. It seems they have sent two men
to the Palace for Perrin&rsquo;s horse, and his wife&rsquo;s. The
rest have left the wagons and servants and are already riding east
as hard as they can go. Behind Perrin&rsquo;s wolfhead, and the Red
Eagle of Manetheren.&rdquo; A faint smile curved her lips as though she
found that amusing. Kairen plainly did not; she gasped, then
clamped her mouth shut in a hard line.</p>

<p>Merana did not find it amusing either, but it was
such a small thing compared to the rest. A faint whiff of something
spoiled when you already sat on a midden heap; a dog snarling at
you when wolves already had hold of your skirts. To think that she
had worried so over Verin, struggled so hard. Verin had hardly
touched her own plans really, except for guiding Demira into
suggesting today&rsquo;s unfortunate confrontation. It had been done
quite skillfully; Merana did not believe anyone but a Gray would
have noticed. Yet she herself had agreed even with that. Facing
al&rsquo;Thor down&mdash;trying to face him down&mdash;was the
least they could have done. She had worried about Verin, and then
Kiruna and Bera appeared, neither with any tie to her authority,
both at least as strong as Masuri or Faeldrin or Rafela.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s a rotten turnip tossed in the
stew,&rdquo; Bera muttered grimly. Kairen and a number of others nodded
agreement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A small turnip,&rdquo; Kiruna told her in a dry tone.
Nearly everyone nodded, except Merana and Verin. Merana just sighed
softly; Verin watched Kiruna with that birdlike gaze, her head
tilted. &ldquo;What is keeping Alanna?&rdquo; Kiruna demanded of no one in
particular. &ldquo;I do not want to go over everything twice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Merana supposed she herself had begun it, deferring
to Verin. She had still been the head of the delegation, everyone
still followed her orders, even Masuri and Rafela and Faeldrin. But
they all knew. She was not certain yet whether Kiruna or Bera had
taken charge&mdash;that one was born on a farm and the other in a
palace mattered not at all; that had nothing to do with being Aes
Sedai&mdash;but the one thing Merana was sure of was that the
embassy was crumbling around her. It was the sort of thing that
would never have happened when the White Tower was whole, when an
ambassador had the full power of the Tower and the Amyrlin Seat
behind her, and no matter if she had taken thirty years to reach
the shawl and barely had enough strength to keep from being sent
away. They were only a collection of Aes Sedai now, slipping into
their relative places without thought.</p>

<p>As if speaking her name had been a summons, Alanna
appeared just as Bera was opening her mouth. She and Kiruna rounded
on Alanna together. &ldquo;Al&rsquo;Thor claims to have gone to Cairhien,&rdquo;
Bera said baldly. &ldquo;Can you add anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alanna faced them proudly, a dangerous gleam in her
dark eyes. They were speaking of her Warder, after all. &ldquo;He is
somewhere to the east. That is all I know. It could be
Cairhien.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you had to bond a man without asking him,&rdquo; Kiruna
demanded in that commanding voice, &ldquo;why, by the Light most holy,
have you not used the bond to bend him to your will? Compared to
the other, that is only slapping his wrist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alanna still had small control of her emotions. Color
actually flooded her cheeks, partly in anger by the way her eyes
flashed, and assuredly partly in shame. &ldquo;Has no one told you?&rdquo; she
asked, too brightly. &ldquo;I suppose no one wants to think of it. I
certainly do not.&rdquo; Faeldrin and Seonid looked at the floor, and
they were not the only ones. &ldquo;I tried to compel him moments after I
bonded him,&rdquo; Alanna continued as if noticing none of it. &ldquo;Have you
ever attempted to uproot an oak tree with your bare hands, Kiruna?
It was much the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kiruna&rsquo;s only reaction was a slow widening of
her eyes, a slow deep breath. Bera actually muttered, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
impossible. Impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alanna threw back her head and laughed. Her hands on
her hips made the laughter seem contemptuous, which tightened
Bera&rsquo;s mouth and brought a cold gleam to Kiruna&rsquo;s eyes.
Verin peered at them, reminding Merana uncomfortably of a robin
peering at worms. Somehow Verin seemed to defer without deferring,
though Merana could not understand how.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one ever before has bonded a man who can
channel,&rdquo; Alanna said when her mirth subsided. &ldquo;Perhaps that has
something to do with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be that as it may,&rdquo; Bera said firmly. Her gaze was
just as firm. &ldquo;Be that as it may. You can still locate him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Kiruna said. &ldquo;You will come with us, Alanna.&rdquo;
Alanna blinked as though coming to herself. Her head bowed slightly
in acquiescence.</p>

<p>It was time, Merana decided. If she was to hold the
delegation together, this was her last chance. She stood, folding
al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s letter to give her hands something to do. &ldquo;When
I brought this embassy to Caemlyn,&rdquo; she began, to remind them all
that she was the head; thank the Light that her voice was steady,
 &ldquo;I was given great leeway, yet it seemed obvious what should be
done, and we,&rdquo; to remind them they were a delegation, &ldquo;set about it
with a fair expectation of success. Al&rsquo;Thor was to be enticed
out of Caemlyn so that we could return Elayne and see her crowned,
placing Andor firmly behind us. Slowly al&rsquo;Thor was to be
brought to trust us, that we would not harm him. And he would have
been brought to show a proper respect as well. Two or three of us,
carefully selected, would have taken Moiraine&rsquo;s place advising
and guiding him. Including Alanna, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know he did not kill Moiraine,&rdquo; Bera
interrupted, &ldquo;as he is said to have killed Morgase?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have heard every sort of rumor concerning her
death,&rdquo; Kiruna added. &ldquo;Some even say she died fighting Lanfear.
Most say she was alone with al&rsquo;Thor when she died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With an effort, Merana stopped herself from
answering. If she allowed those ingrained instincts a word, they
would take them all in the end. &ldquo;All that was in hand,&rdquo; she went
on, &ldquo;when you two arrived. Only by chance, I know, and only
following your instructions to find him, yet you brought our number
to thirteen. What man of al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s sort would not flee as
fast as he could hearing of thirteen Aes Sedai together? The simple
fact is, whatever damage has been done to our plans must be laid at
your feet, Kiruna, and yours, Bera.&rdquo; She could only wait then. If
she had managed to gain any moral ascendancy at all&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you quite finished?&rdquo; Bera said coolly.</p>

<p>Kiruna was even more blunt. She turned to the others.
 &ldquo;Faeldrin, you will come with us to Cairhien, if you will. And you
also, Masuri, Rafela.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Merana trembled, the folded letter crumpling in her
fist. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;You talk as if we can go
on as before, as if nothing has changed. There is an embassy from
Elaida in Cairhien, from the White Tower. That is how al&rsquo;Thor
must see it. We need him more than he needs us, and I fear he knows
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment, shock covered every face save
Verin&rsquo;s. Verin only nodded thoughtfully, smiling a small,
secretive smile. For a moment, every other face was full of wide
eyes, stunned. Those words seemed to ring in the air. <em>We need
him more than he needs us</em>. They did not need the Three Oaths
to know it for truth.</p>

<p>Then Bera said quite firmly, &ldquo;Sit down, Merana, and
calm yourself.&rdquo; Merana was sitting before she realized it; still
trembling, still wanting to shout, but sitting with her hands
clutched together around al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s missive.</p>

<p>Kiruna turned her back deliberately. &ldquo;Seonid, you
will come, of course. Another pair of Gaidin are always useful. And
Verin, I think.&rdquo; Verin nodded as if it were a request. &ldquo;Demira,&rdquo;
Kiruna went on, &ldquo;I know you have grievance against him, but we do
not want to panic the man again, and someone must shepherd that
extraordinary collection of girls from the Two Rivers to Salidar.
You, Valinde, Kairen and Berenicia must assist Merana in that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other four named murmured acceptance without the
slightest hesitation, but Merana felt cold. The delegation was not
crumbling; it was gone to dust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She trailed off as Bera&rsquo;s gaze
turned to her, and Kiruna&rsquo;s. And Masuri&rsquo;s and
Faeldrin&rsquo;s and Rafela&rsquo;s as well. Gone to dust, and all
her authority with it. &ldquo;You may find some need for a Gray,&rdquo; she
said faintly. &ldquo;There will certainly be negotiations, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
Words failed her again. This would never have happened when the
Tower was whole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Bera said at last, in such a tone that
all Merana&rsquo;s control only just kept her cheeks from going
crimson in shame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Demira, you will see the girls to Salidar,&rdquo; Kiruna
said.</p>

<p>Merana sat very still. She prayed that the Hall had
chosen an Amyrlin by now. Someone very strong, in the Power and in
her heart. It would take another Deane, another Rashima, to make
them once more what they had been. She prayed Alanna led them to
al&rsquo;Thor before he decided to acknowledge Elaida. Even another
Rashima would not save them then.</p>
