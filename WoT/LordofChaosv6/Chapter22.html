five stones made a smoothly spinning circle above
Mat&rsquo;s hands, one red, one blue, one clear green, the others
striped in interesting ways. He rode on, guiding Pips with his
knees, the black-hafted spear thrust behind the saddle girth on the
opposite side from his unstrung bow. The stones made him think of
Thom Merrilin, who had taught him to juggle, and he wondered
whether the old fellow was still alive. Probably not. Rand had sent
the gleeman haring after Elayne and Nynaeve what seemed a very long
time ago now, supposedly to look out for them. If any two women
needed looking out for less, Mat did not know them, but no two were
more likely to get a man killed because they would not listen to
reason. Nynaeve, poking into everything a man did or said or
thought and tugging her bloody braid at a fellow all the time, and
Elayne the bloody Daughter-Heir, thinking she could get her way by
sticking her nose in the air and telling you what for as bad as
Nynaeve ever did, only Elayne was worse, because if frosty
high-handedness failed, Elayne smiled and flashed her dimple and
expected everybody to fall down because she was pretty. He hoped
Thom had managed to survive their company. He hoped they were all
right too, but he would not mind if they had found themselves in
the pickling kettle at least once since scurrying off to the Light
knew where. Let them see what it was like without him to haul them
out, and never an honest word of thanks when he was there to do it.
Not too hot a kettle, mind&mdash;just enough to make them wish Mat
Cauthon were around to rescue them again like an idiot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about you, Mat?&rdquo; Nalesean asked, reining
closer. &ldquo;Did you ever think what it would be like to be a
Warder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat nearly dropped the stones. Daerid and Talmanes
looked at him, sweaty-faced and waiting an answer. The sun was
sliding toward the horizon; not long before they would have to
stop. Twilight seemed to last a little longer as the days
shortened, but Mat wanted to be settled in with his pipe by dusk.
Besides, in terrain like this, horses broke legs once the light
failed. So did men.</p>

<p>The Band stretched out northward behind them, horse
and foot beneath a rising tail of dust, banners flying but drums
silent, across low hills covered with sparse scrub and scattered
thickets. Eleven days since leaving Maerone, and they were halfway
to Tear or a little better, moving faster than Mat had really hoped
for. And only one full day spent resting the horses. He was
certainly in no hurry to take Weiramon&rsquo;s place, but he could
not help wondering how much distance they <em>could</em> cover
between sunup and sundown if they had to. So far their best had
been forty-five miles, as near as anyone could calculate. Of
course, the supply wagons took half the night catching up, but the
foot had been making a point lately of showing they could match the
horse over the long haul if not the short.</p>

<p>A little farther back and to the east, a band of Aiel
crested a tree-fringed rise, running easily and slowly closing the
distance. Likely they had been trotting since sunrise, and would
until nightfall if not later. If they passed the Band while there
was still light to see, it would be encouragement for tomorrow.
Whenever Aiel passed them, they seemed ready to try for another
mile or two the next day.</p>

<p>A few miles ahead the thickets blended into solid
forest again; it would be necessary to drop down closer to the
Erinin before they reached that. As they crested a hilltop, Mat
could see the river, and the five hired riverboats flying the Red
Hand. Four more were on their way back to Maerone to reload, mainly
with fodder for the horses. What he could not see yet knew were
there were the people, some meandering upriver, some down, some
changing direction whenever they met a group led by someone with a
convincing tongue. A handful had carts, usually pulled by
themselves, and a few wagons, but most nothing beyond what they
wore on their backs; even the densest brigands had learned there
was no point to bothering those. Mat had no idea where they were
going and neither did they, yet they were just enough to clog the
sorry excuse for a road along the river. Short of clubbing people
out of the way, the Band could make much better time up here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Warder?&rdquo; Mat said, tucking the stones into his
saddlebags. He could find more anywhere, but he liked the colors.
He had an eagle feather in there, too, and a piece of weathered
snow-white stone that might have been carved with scrolls once.
There had been a boulder that looked as if it had been the head of
a statue, too, but the thing would have needed a wagon. &ldquo;Never.
They&rsquo;re all fools and dupes, letting Aes Sedai lead them
around by the nose. What put a notion like that in your head?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nalesean shrugged. He fairly oozed sweat, but he
still wore his coat&mdash;red striped with blue today&mdash;buttoned to the neck. Mat&rsquo;s hung open, and he still thought he
was broiling. &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s all the Aes Sedai,&rdquo; the Tairen
said. &ldquo;Burn my soul, it can&rsquo;t but make you think, can it? I
mean, burn my soul, what are they up to?&rdquo; He meant the Aes Sedai on
the other side of the Erinin, reportedly scurrying upriver or down
a sight quicker than the wanderers that were over there as
well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Best not to think about them is what I say.&rdquo; Mat
touched the silver foxhead through his shirt; even with that, he
was glad the Aes Sedai were across the river. A handful of his
soldiers traveled on each of the river craft, and few as villages
were, they put a boat ashore on his orders at every one they passed
on the far side, to see what they could learn. So far the news had
been unrevealing and often unpleasant. Aes Sedai swarming was the
least of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how are we not to think of them?&rdquo; Talmanes
asked. &ldquo;Do you think the Tower really did pull Logain&rsquo;s
strings?&rdquo; That was one of the newer bits, just two days old.</p>

<p>Mat pulled off his hat long enough to mop his
forehead before answering. Nightfall would be a little cooler. But
no wine, no ale, no women, and no gambling. Who would be a soldier
for choice? &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much I&rsquo;d say was beyond Aes
Sedai.&rdquo; Sliding a finger behind the scarf around his neck, he eased
it. One thing about Warders, by what he knew from observing Lan
anyway, they never seemed to sweat. &ldquo;But that? Talmanes, I&rsquo;d
believe you were Aes Sedai first. You aren&rsquo;t, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Daerid doubled over the pommel of his saddle
laughing, and Nalesean nearly fell off his horse. Talmanes
stiffened at first, but finally he grinned. He almost chuckled. The
man did not have much sense of humor, but he did have some.</p>

<p>His seriousness reasserted itself quickly, though.
 &ldquo;What about the Dragonsworn? If it is true, Mat, it means trouble.&rdquo;
The others&rsquo; laughter might as well have been chopped with an
axe.</p>

<p>Mat grimaced. That was the newest news or rumor&mdash;call it what you would&mdash;picked up yesterday, a
village burned somewhere in Murandy. Worse, supposedly they had
killed everybody who would not swear to the Dragon Reborn, and
their families with them. &ldquo;Rand will settle for them. If it&rsquo;s
true. Aes Sedai, Dragonsworn, all that is his business, and
we&rsquo;re well out of it. We have our own to tend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That made nobody&rsquo;s face less grim, of course.
They had seen too many burned villages, and thought they would see
more soon after reaching Tear. Who would be a soldier?</p>

<p>A horseman appeared over the next rise ahead,
galloping toward them, leaping his mount over brush rather than
swerve around even on the downslope. Mat signed for a halt, adding,
 &ldquo;No trumpets.&rdquo; Word rippled behind him in a fading murmur, but he
kept his eyes on the rider.</p>

<p>Dripping sweat, Chel Vanin reined his dun gelding in
before Mat. In a rough gray coat that fit his balding bulk like a
sack, he sat his saddle like a sack, too. Vanin was fat, and no
getting around it. Yet improbable as it seemed, he could ride
anything ever born, and he was very good at what he did.</p>

<p>Long before they reached Maerone, Mat had surprised
Nalesean, Daerid and Talmanes by asking for the names of the best
poachers and horse thieves among their men, the ones they knew were
guilty but could not prove anything against. The two nobles in
particular had not wanted to admit having any such men in their
commands, but after a little prodding they came up with the names
of three Cairhienin, two Tairens and, surprisingly, two Andorans.
Mat had not thought any of the Andorans had been with the Band long
enough to make themselves known like that, but apparently word got
about.</p>

<p>Those seven men he took aside and told that he needed
scouts, and that a good scout used much the same skills as a
poacher or horse thief. Ignoring fervent denials that they had ever
committed any crime whatsoever&mdash;more from each than from
Talmanes and Nalesean combined, and just as eloquent if far coarser&mdash;he offered pardons for any thefts done before that day,
triple pay and no work details as long as they reported the truth.
And a hanging for the first lie; a lot of men could die from a
scout&rsquo;s lie. Even with the threat they leaped at it, probably
more for less work than for the extra silver.</p>

<p>But seven was not enough, so he asked them to suggest
others, and to keep in mind what he said about the needed skills,
as well as the fact that whether they lived to collect their triple
pay would depend in large part on the abilities of those they
named. That caused a lot of chin-scratching and edgy looks, but
between them they produced eleven more names, emphasizing all the
while that they were not implying anything about those fellows.
Eleven men, good enough poachers and horse thieves that neither
Daerid nor Talmanes nor Nalesean had suspected them but not good
enough to avoid the notice of the first seven. Mat made those the
same offer, and asked for names again. By the time he reached a
point where no more names were to be found, he had forty-seven
scouts. Hard times had put a lot of men to soldiering instead of
the craft they would rather have followed.</p>

<p>The last, named by all three just before him, had
been Chel Vanin, an Andoran who had lived in Maerone but ranged
wide on both sides of the Erinin. Vanin could steal a hen
pheasant&rsquo;s eggs without disturbing her on the nest, though it
was unlikely he would fail to put her in the sack too. Vanin could
steal a horse out from under a nobleman without the nobleman
knowing it for two days. Or so his recommenders claimed in tones of
awe. With a gap-toothed smile and a look of utter innocence on his
round face, Vanin had protested he was a stableman and sometime
farrier, when he could find work. But he would take the job for
four times the Band&rsquo;s normal pay. So far, he had been more
than worth it.</p>

<p>Sitting his dun in front of Mat on that hilltop,
Vanin looked disturbed. He approved of Mat not wanting to be called
 &ldquo;my Lord,&rdquo; since he did much like bowing to anyone, but he managed
to knuckle his forehead casually in a rough sort of salute. &ldquo;I
think you got to see this. I don&rsquo;t know what to make of it
myself. You got to look for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo; Mat told the others, and to Vanin, &ldquo;Show
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not a long ride, just over the next two hills
and up a winding stream with wide borders of dried mud. The smell
announced what Vanin wanted him to see before the first vultures
waddled into the air. The others just flapped a few paces before
settling again, darting featherless heads and squawking challenges.
Worst were those that never looked up from their dinners, milling
piles of stained black feathers.</p>

<p>An overturned wagon like a little house on wheels,
virulently painted in green and blue and yellow, identified the
scene as a Tinker caravan, but few of the wagons had escaped
burning. Bodies lay everywhere in bright clothes torn and darkened
with dried blood, men and women and children. A part of Mat
analyzed it coldly; the rest of him wanted to vomit, or run,
anything but sit there on Pips. The attackers had come from the
west first. Most of the men and older boys lay there, mingled with
what was left of a number of large dogs, as if they had tried to
form a line, to hold back killers with their bodies while the women
and children ran. A futile flight. Heaped corpses showed where they
had run headlong into the second attack. Only the vultures moved
now.</p>

<p>Vanin spat disgustedly through a gap in his teeth.
 &ldquo;You chase them off before they steal too much&mdash;they&rsquo;ll
snap up children if you don&rsquo;t look sharp; raise them as their
own&mdash;maybe you add a kick to speed them, but you don&rsquo;t
do this. Who would?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Brigands.&rdquo; The horses were all
gone. But brigands wanted to steal, not kill, and no Tinker would
resist if you stole his last penny and his coat to boot. Mat forced
his hands to ease their grip on his reins. There was nowhere to
look without seeing a dead woman, a dead child. Whoever did this
had not wanted any survivors. He rode a slow circuit around the
site, trying to ignore the vultures that hissed and flared their
wings when he passed&mdash;the ground was too dry to hold tracks
well, although he thought horses had gone in several directions&mdash;and came back to Vanin. &ldquo;You could have told me about it. I
don&rsquo;t need to see.&rdquo; <em>Light, but I don&rsquo;t!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;I could&rsquo;ve told you there was no good tracks,&rdquo;
Vanin said, turning his horse to wade the shallow stream. &ldquo;Maybe
you need to see this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fire had taken most of the wagon lying on its side,
but the wagon bed survived, propped on yellow wheels with red
spokes. A man in a coat that still showed a little eye-wrenching
blue lay hard against it, one sprawled hand black with blood. What
he had written in shaky letters stood out darker than the wood of
the wagon bottom.</p>

<p class="verse">TELL THE DRAGON REBORN</p>

<p><em>Tell him what?</em> Mat thought. That somebody
had killed a whole caravan of Tinkers? Or had the man died before
he could write whatever it was? It would not have been the first
time Tinkers had come onto important information. In a story he
would have lived just long enough to scrawl the vital bit that
meant victory. Well, whatever the message, nobody was ever going to
know a word more now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were right, Vanin.&rdquo; Mat hesitated. Tell the
Dragon Reborn what? No reason to start any more rumors than they
already had. &ldquo;See the rest of this wagon burns before you leave.
And if anybody asks, there was nothing here but a lot of dead men.&rdquo;
And women, and children.</p>

<p>Vanin nodded. &ldquo;Filthy savages,&rdquo; he muttered, and spat
through his teeth again. &ldquo;Could have been some of them, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That band of Aielmen had caught up, three or four
hundred strong. They trotted down the slope and crossed the stream
no more than fifty paces from the wagons. A number raised a hand in
greeting; Mat did not recognize them, but a good many Aiel had
heard of Rand al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s friend, he who wore the hat and
whom it was better not to gamble against. Across the stream and up
the next slope, and all those bodies might as well not have
existed.</p>

<p><em>Bloody Aiel</em>, Mat thought. He knew that Aiel
avoided Tinkers, ignored them, if not why, but this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;See it burns, Vanin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Talmanes and the other two were right where he had
left them, of course. When Mat told them what lay ahead, and that
burial parties had to be told off, they nodded grimly, Daerid
muttering a disbelieving, &ldquo;Tinkers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will camp here,&rdquo; Mat added.</p>

<p>He expected some comment&mdash;there was light left
for a few more miles, and these three had gotten caught up in how
far the Band could move in a day to the point of laying wagers&mdash;but Nalesean just said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send a man down to signal
the ships before they get too far ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maybe they felt the way he did. Unless they swung all
the way over to the river, there would be no avoiding at least the
sight of vultures scattering into the sky from the burial parties.
Just because a man had seen death did not mean he had to enjoy it.
For Mat&rsquo;s part, he thought another look at those birds would
empty his stomach. In the morning there would only be graves,
safely out of eyeshot.</p>

<p>The memory would not go out of his head, though, even
after his tent was raised on that very hilltop where it might catch
a breeze off the river if one ever decided to rise. Bodies hacked
by killers, ravaged by vultures. Worse than the battle around
Cairhien against the Shaido. Maidens had died there, but he had not
seen any, and there had been no children. A Tinker would not fight
even to defend his life. Nobody killed the Traveling People. He
picked at his beef and beans, and retired to his tent as soon as he
could. Even Nalesean did not want to talk, and Talmanes looked
tighter than ever.</p>

<p>Word of the killing had spread. There was a quiet
over the camp Mat had heard before. Usually the darkness would be
broken by at least a little raucous laughter and sometimes songs
off-key and off-color until the bannermen drove the handful who
would not admit they were tired to their blankets. Tonight was like
the times they had found a village with the dead unburied or a
group of refugees who had tried to keep their little from bandits.
Few could laugh or sing after that, and those who could were
usually silenced by the rest.</p>

<p>Mat lay smoking his pipe while darkness fell, but the
tent was close, and sleep would not come for memories of Tinker
dead, older memories of older dead. Too many battles, and too many
dead. He fingered his spear, traced the inscription in the Old
Tongue along the black shaft.</p>

<p class="verse">Thus is our treaty written; thus is agreement made.<br>
 Thought is the arrow of time; memory never fades.<br>
 What was asked is given; the price is paid.</p>

<p>He had gotten the worst of that deal.</p>

<p>After a time he gathered a blanket, and after a
moment the spear, and padded outside in his smallclothes, the
silver foxhead on his bare chest catching the light of the clipped
moon. There was a slight breeze, a meager stirring with little
coolness that scarcely shifted the Red Hand banner on its staff
stuck in the ground before his tent, yet better than inside.</p>

<p>Tossing his blanket down among the scrub, he lay on
his back. When he was a boy, he&rsquo;d sometimes used to put
himself to sleep naming the constellations. In that cloudless sky,
the moon gave enough light to wash out most stars even if it was
waning, but it left enough. There was the Haywain, high overhead,
and the Five Sisters, and the Three Geese pointing the way north.
The Archer, the Plowman, the Blacksmith, the Snake. Aiel called
that one the Dragon. The Shield, that some called Hawkwing&rsquo;s
Shield&mdash;that made him shift; in some of his memories he did
not like Artur Paendrag Tanreall at all&mdash;the Stag, and the
Ram. The Cup, and the Traveler with her staff standing out
sharp.</p>

<p>Something caught his ear, he was not sure what. If
the night had not been so still, the faint sound might not have
seemed furtive, but it was and it did. Who would be sneaking around
up here? Curious, he lifted up on an elbow&mdash;and froze.</p>

<p>Like moonshadows, shapes moved around his tent.
Moonlight caught one enough for him to make out a veiled face.
Aiel? What under the Light? Silently they surrounded the tent,
closed in; bright metal flashed in the night, whispers of cloth
being sliced, and they vanished inside. A moment only and they were
back out. And looking around; there was light enough to see
that.</p>

<p>Mat gathered his feet under him. If he kept low, he
might be able to slip away without being heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat?&rdquo; Talmanes called up the hillside; he sounded
drunk.</p>

<p>Mat went still; maybe the man would go back if he
thought he was asleep. The Aiel seemed to melt away, but he was
sure they had gone to ground where they were.</p>

<p>Talmanes&rsquo; boots crunched closer. &ldquo;I have some
brandy here, Mat. I think you should take it. It is very good for
dreams, Mat. You do not remember them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat wondered whether the Aiel would hear him over
Talmanes if he went now. Ten paces or so to where the nearest men
would be sleeping&mdash;the First Banner of Horse, Talmanes&rsquo;
Thunderbolts, had the &ldquo;honor&rdquo; tonight&mdash;less than ten to his
tent, and the Aiel. They were fast, but with a step or two, they
should not catch him before he had fifty men almost within
arm&rsquo;s reach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat? I do not believe you are asleep, Mat. I saw
your face. It is better once you kill the dreams. Believe me, I
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat crouched, clutching his spear and taking a deep
breath. Two strides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat?&rdquo; Talmanes was nearer. The idiot was going to
step on an Aiel any time now. They would cut his throat without
making a sound.</p>

<p><em>Burn you</em>, Mat thought. <em>All I needed was
two strides</em>. &ldquo;Out swords!&rdquo; he shouted, leaping upright. &ldquo;Aiel
in the camp!&rdquo; He sprinted down the slope. &ldquo;Rally to the banner!
Rally to the Red Hand! Rally, you dog-riding grave-robbers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That woke everyone, of course, as well it should with
him bellowing like a bull in briars. Shouts spread in every
direction; drums began beating assembly, trumpets sounding rally.
Men of the First Horse roared out of their blankets, racing toward
the banner waving swords.</p>

<p>Still, the fact was, the Aiel had a shorter distance
to run than the soldiers. And they knew what they were after.
Something&mdash;instinct, his luck, being <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>;
Mat certainly did not hear anything over the racket&mdash;made him
turn just as the first veiled shape appeared behind as if springing
out of the air. No time to think. He blocked the thrust of a
stabbing spear with the haft of his spear, but the Aiel caught his
return slash on a buckler and kicked him in the belly. Desperation
gave Mat strength to keep his legs straight with no air in his
lungs; he twisted aside frantically from a spearhead that sliced
his ribs, clipped the Aiel&rsquo;s legs out from under him with his
own spear haft, and stabbed him through the heart. Light, but he
hoped it was a him.</p>

<p>He jerked the spear free just in time to face the
onslaught. <em>I should have run when I first had the bloody
chance!</em> He worked the thing like a quarterstaff as fast as he
ever had in his life, spinning, blocking away lancing Aiel
spearpoints, no time to strike back. Too many. <em>I should have
kept my bloody mouth shut and run!</em> He found breath again.
 &ldquo;Rally, you pigeon-gutted sheep-stealers! Are you all deaf? Clean
out your ears and rally!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wondering why he was not dead yet&mdash;he had been
lucky with one Aiel, but nobody had enough luck to face this&mdash;he suddenly realized he was no longer alone. A skinny Cairhienin in
his smallclothes fell nearly under his feet with a shrill yell,
only to be replaced by a Tairen with his shirt flapping and sword
swinging. More crowded in, shouting everything from &ldquo;Lord Matrim
and victory!&rdquo; to &ldquo;The Red Hand!&rdquo; to &ldquo;Kill the black-eyed
vermin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat slipped back and left them to it. <em>The general
who leads in the front of battle is a fool</em>. That came from one
of those old memories, a quote from somebody whose name was not
part of the memory. <em>A man could get killed in there</em>. That
was pure Mat Cauthon.</p>

<p>In the end, it was a sheer matter of numbers. A dozen
Aiel and, if not the whole Band, several hundred who managed to
reach the hilltop before it was done. Twelve Aiel dead and, because
they were Aiel, half again as many of the Band, with twice that or
more bleeding if still alive to groan while they were tended. Even
with his brief exposure, Mat stung and bled at half a dozen places,
at least three of which he suspected would need stitching.</p>

<p>His spear made a good walking staff as he limped
around to where Talmanes was stretched out on the ground with
Daerid tying a tourniquet around his left leg.</p>

<p>Talmanes&rsquo; white shirt, hanging loose, glistened
darkly in two places. &ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; he panted, &ldquo;Nerim will get to try
his hand as a seamstress on me again, burn him for a ham-fisted
bull.&rdquo; Nerim was his serving man, and mended his master as often as
his master&rsquo;s clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will he be all right?&rdquo; Mat asked softly.</p>

<p>Daerid shrugged. He wore only his breeches. &ldquo;He is
bleeding less than you, I think.&rdquo; He glanced up. He would have a
new scar to add to the collection on his face. &ldquo;As well you got out
of their way, Mat: It is clear they were after you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good not to give them what they came for.&rdquo; Wincing,
Talmanes struggled to his feet with the aid of an arm over
Daerid&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;It would be a shame to lose the
Band&rsquo;s luck to a handful of savages in the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat cleared his throat. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way it
seemed to me, too.&rdquo; The image of the Aiel vanishing into his tent
welled up in his mind, and he shivered. Why under the Light would
Aiel want to kill him?</p>

<p>Nalesean appeared from where the dead Aiel were laid
out in a row. Even now he had his coat on, though not buttoned; he
kept frowning at a bloodstain on the lapel, maybe his blood, maybe
not. &ldquo;Burn my soul, I knew those savages would turn on us sooner or
later. I expect they came from that lot who passed us earlier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;If they had wanted me, they
could have had me spitted and over the fire for dinner before any
of you knew it.&rdquo; He made himself hobble over and study the Aiel,
taking a lantern someone had brought to aid the moonlight. The
relief of finding only men&rsquo;s faces nearly unhinged his knees.
He did not know any of them, but then, he did not really know many
Aiel. &ldquo;Shaido, I expect,&rdquo; he said, returning to the others with the
lantern. They could be Shaido. They could be Darkfriends; he knew
all too well that there were Darkfriends among the Aiel. And
Darkfriends, of course, did have reason to want him dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; Daerid said, &ldquo;I think we should try to
find one of those Aes Sedai across the river. Talmanes here will
live unless all the brandy leaked out of him, but some of the
others might not be so fortunate.&rdquo; Nalesean said nothing, but his
grunt spoke volumes; he was Tairen, after all, with less love than
Mat for Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>Mat did not hesitate in agreeing. He would not be
letting any Aes Sedai channel at him&mdash;in a way, every scar
marked a small victory, another time he had avoided Aes Sedai&mdash;but he could not ask a man to die. Then he told them what
else he wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A ditch?&rdquo; Talmanes said in tones of disbelief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the way around the camp?&rdquo; Nalesean&rsquo;s
pointed beard quivered. &ldquo;Every night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a palisade?&rdquo; Daerid exclaimed. Glancing
around, he lowered his voice. There were still quite a few soldiers
about, hauling away the dead. &ldquo;There will be a mutiny, Mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No there won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mat said. &ldquo;By morning, every
last man will know Aiel sneaked through the whole camp to reach my
tent. Half won&rsquo;t sleep for thinking they will wake with an
Aiel spear in their ribs. You three make sure they understand the
fact that a palisade just might keep Aiel from sneaking in again.&rdquo;
At the least it would slow them down. &ldquo;Now go away and let me get a
little sleep tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After they had gone, he studied his tent. Long
slashes in the walls, where Aiel had gone in, stirred in the fitful
breeze. Sighing, he started to return to his blanket in the scrub,
then hesitated. That noise that had alerted him. The Aiel had not
made another, not a whisper. A shadow made as much noise as an
Aiel. So what had it been?</p>

<p>Leaning on his spear, he limped around the tent,
studying the ground. He was not sure what he was looking for. Soft
Aiel boots had left no marks that he could make out by lantern
light. Two of the tent ropes hung where they had been cut, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;he set the lantern down and fingered the ropes. That sound could
have been taut rope being sliced, yet there was no reason to cut
these to get inside. Something about the angle of the cuts, the way
they lined up with one another, caught his attention. Taking up the
lantern, he cast around. A wiry bush not far away had been trimmed
along one side, thin branches with small leaves lying on the
ground. A very neat trimming, perfectly flat, the severed branch
ends smooth as though planed by a cabinetmaker.</p>

<p>The hair on the back of Mat&rsquo;s neck stirred. One
of those holes in the air that Rand used had been opened here. Bad
enough that Aiel had tried to kill him, but they had been sent by
somebody who could make one of those&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;gateways, Rand called
them. Light, if he was not safe from the Forsaken with the Band
around him, where was he safe? He wondered how he was going to
sleep from now on with watch fires around his tent. And guards; a
guard of honor, he could call it to take some of the sting away, to
stand sentry around his tent. Next time it would probably be a
hundred Trollocs, or a thousand, instead of a handful of Aiel. Or
was he important enough for that? If they decided he was too
important, the next time it could be one of the Forsaken. Blood and
ashes! He had never asked to be <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, never asked
to be tied to the Dragon Bloody Reborn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood and bloody&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soil crunching underfoot warned him, and he spun
swinging the spear with a snarl. Barely in time he stopped the
slashing blade, as Olver screamed and fell flat on his back,
staring wide-eyed at the spearpoint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the bloody Pit of Doom are you doing here?&rdquo;
Mat snapped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; The boy stopped to swallow. &ldquo;They
say fifty Aiel tried to kill you in your sleep, Lord Mat, but you
killed them first, and I wanted to see if you were all right, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Lord Edorion bought me some shoes. See?&rdquo; He raised a shod
foot.</p>

<p>Muttering under his breath, Mat hauled Olver to his
feet. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t what I meant. Why aren&rsquo;t you in
Maerone? Didn&rsquo;t Edorion find somebody to look after you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She just wanted Lord Edorion&rsquo;s coin, not me.
She had six children of her own. Master Burdin gives me lots to
eat, and all I have to do is feed and water his horses, and rub
them down. I like that, Lord Mat. He will not let me ride them,
though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A throat cleared. &ldquo;Lord Talmanes sent me, my Lord.&rdquo;
Nerim was short even for a Cairhienin, a skinny gray-haired man
with a long face that seemed to say nothing was going well at the
moment and in the long run, this was a better day than most. &ldquo;If my
Lord will pardon me for saying, those bloodstains will never come
out of my Lord&rsquo;s smallclothes, but if my Lord will allow it, I
may be able to do something for the tears in my Lord.&rdquo; He had his
sewing box under one arm. &ldquo;You, boy, fetch some water. No back
talk. Water for my Lord, and quickly.&rdquo; Nerim combined picking up
the lantern with a bow. &ldquo;If my Lord will step inside? Night air is
bad for wounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In short order Mat was stretched out beside his
bedding&mdash;&ldquo;My Lord will not want to stain his blankets&rdquo;&mdash;letting Nerim wash away dried blood and sew him up. Talmanes was
right; as a seamstress, the man was a ham-fisted cook. With Olver
there, there was no choice but to grit his teeth and bear it.</p>

<p>To try taking his mind elsewhere than Nerim&rsquo;s
needle, Mat pointed to the frayed cloth scrip hanging from
Olver&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;What do you have in there?&rdquo; he panted.</p>

<p>Olver clutched the tattered bag to his chest. He was
certainly cleaner than he had been, if no prettier. The shoes
appeared stout, and his woolen shirt and breeches looked new. &ldquo;It
is mine,&rdquo; he said defensively. &ldquo;I did not steal anything.&rdquo; After a
moment, he opened the bag and began laying things out. A spare pair
of breeches, two more shirts and some stockings had no interest for
him, but he listed the other things. &ldquo;This is my redhawk&rsquo;s
feather, Lord Mat, and this stone is just the color of the sun.
See?&rdquo; He added a small purse. &ldquo;I have five coppers and a silver
penny.&rdquo; A rolled cloth tied with a string and a small wooden box.
 &ldquo;My game of Snakes and Foxes; my father made it for me; he drew the
board.&rdquo; For a moment his face crumpled, then he went on. &ldquo;And see,
this stone has a fish head in it. I do not know how it got there.
And this is my turtle shell. A blue-back turtle. See the
stripes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wincing at a particularly hard thrust of the sewing
needle, Mat stretched his hand to finger the rolled cloth. Much
better if he breathed through his nose. It was odd how those holes
in his real memories worked; he could remember how to play Snakes
and Foxes, but not ever playing it. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine turtle
shell, Olver. I had one, once. A green basker.&rdquo; Stretching his hand
the other way, he reached his own purse; he dipped out two gold
Cairhienin crowns. &ldquo;Add these to your purse, Olver. A man needs a
little gold in his pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stiffly Olver began stuffing things back into his
scrip. &ldquo;I do not beg, Lord Mat. I can work for my supper. I am not
a beggar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never meant to say you are.&rdquo; Mat cast around
hurriedly for some reason to pay the boy two crowns. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I
need someone to carry messages for me. Can&rsquo;t ask any of the
Band; they are all busy soldiering. Of course, you&rsquo;d have to
take care of your own horse. I could not ask anybody to do it for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olver sat up straight. &ldquo;I would have my own horse?&rdquo;
he said incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. There is one thing. My name is Mat. You
call me <em>Lord</em> Mat again, and I&rsquo;ll tie your nose in a
knot.&rdquo; Bellowing, he jerked half-upright. &ldquo;Burn you, Nerim,
that&rsquo;s a leg, not a bloody side of beef!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As my Lord says,&rdquo; Nerim murmured, &ldquo;my Lord&rsquo;s
leg is not a side of beef. Thank you, my Lord, for instructing
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olver was feeling his nose hesitantly, as if
considering whether it could be tied in a knot.</p>

<p>Mat settled back with a groan. Now he had saddled
himself with a boy, and had done the lad no favor&mdash;not if he
was nearby the next time the Forsaken tried to reduce the number of
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> in the world. Well, if Rand&rsquo;s plan
worked, there would be one less Forsaken. If Mat Cauthon had his
way, he intended to stay out of trouble and out of danger until
there were no Forsaken.</p>
