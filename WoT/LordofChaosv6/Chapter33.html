<h4><em>Courage to Strengthen</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">K</span>neeling
in just her shift, Egwene frowned at the
dark green silk riding dress she had worn into the Waste, what
seemed a very long time ago. There was so much to do. She had given
some time to writing a hasty note and rousing Cowinde from her
blankets with instructions to leave it at The Long Man in the
morning. It said little beyond the fact that she had to go away&mdash;she did not know much more&mdash;but she could not just
disappear without telling Gawyn. A few of the phrases made her
blush to remember&mdash;saying she loved him was one thing, but
actually <em>asking</em> him to wait!&mdash;yet she had taken care
of him as far as was possible. Now she had to ready herself, and
she hardly knew for what.</p>

<p>The tent flap was thrown back, and Amys entered, then
Bair and Sorilea. They stood in a line, looking down at her. Three
faces stern with disapproval. It was very hard not to clutch the
dress to her breast; in her shift, she felt very much at a
disadvantage. In armor, she would have been at a disadvantage. A
matter of knowing she was in the wrong. She was surprised it had
taken them so long to come.</p>

<p>She took a deep breath. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve come to
punish me, I don&rsquo;t have time for carrying water or digging
holes or any of it. I am sorry, but I said I would come as soon as
I can, and I think they mean to count minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amys&rsquo; pale eyebrows rose in surprise, and a
puzzled look passed between Sorilea and Bair. &ldquo;How should we punish
you?&rdquo; Amys asked. &ldquo;You stopped being a pupil the moment your
sisters summoned you. You must go to them as Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene covered a wince by examining the riding dress
again. It had gathered remarkably few wrinkles for having been
rolled up in a chest all these months. She made herself face them
again. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re angry with me, and you have cause&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Angry?&rdquo; Sorilea said. &ldquo;We are not angry. I thought
you knew us better.&rdquo; It was true she did not sound angry, yet
censure still painted all their faces, including hers.</p>

<p>Egwene stared from one to another, especially Amys
and Bair. &ldquo;But you told me how wrong you think what I&rsquo;m going
to do is; you said I must not even think about it. I said I
wouldn&rsquo;t, and then I went ahead and worked out how to do
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Startlingly, a smile bloomed on Sorilea&rsquo;s
leathery face. Her multitude of bracelets clattered as she shifted
her shawl in a satisfied manner. &ldquo;You see? I told you she would
understand. She could be Aiel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of the tightness faded from Amys, a little more
from Bair, and Egwene understood. They were not angry that she
meant to try entering <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> in the
flesh. That was wrong in their eyes, but you had to do what you
felt you had to do, and even if this worked it incurred no
obligation except to herself. Not angry at all really, not yet.
What dug at them was her lie. Her stomach fluttered. The lie she
had admitted. Maybe her smallest lie.</p>

<p>Another deep breath was required to prime her throat
for the words. &ldquo;I lied about other things, too. I entered <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> alone after I promised I would not.&rdquo;
Amys&rsquo; face darkened again. Sorilea, not a dreamwalker, only
shook her head ruefully. &ldquo;I promised to obey as a pupil, but when
you said the World of Dreams was too dangerous after I was injured,
I went anyway.&rdquo; Bair folded her arms, expressionless. Sorilea
muttered something about foolish girls, but it hardly sounded
heated. A third long breath; this would be the hardest to say. Her
middle was not fluttering anymore; it danced so hard she was
surprised she was not shaking. &ldquo;The worst of all is, I am not Aes
Sedai. I&rsquo;m only Accepted. You might call me an apprentice. I
will not be raised to Aes Sedai for years, if I ever am, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sorilea&rsquo;s head came up at that, thin lips
compressed in a hard line, but still none of them said anything. It
was up to Egwene to make matters right. They could never be exactly
as before, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>You&rsquo;ve admitted everything</em>, a small voice
whispered. <em>Now you&rsquo;d better get on with finding out how fast
you can reach Salidar. You can still be raised Aes Sedai one day,
but not if you make them madder than they already are</em>.</p>

<p>Egwene lowered her eyes and stared at the colorful
layered carpets, her mouth twisting with scorn. Scorn for that
small voice. And shame that it could speak in her head, that she
could think it. She was going away, but before she did, she had to
put matters right. It was possible, under <em>
ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>. You did what you had to do, then paid the
cost. Long months ago, in the Waste, Aviendha had showed her how a
lie was paid for.</p>

<p>Gathering every scrap of courage she could find,
hoping it was enough, Egwene put the silk dress aside and stood.
Strangely, beginning seemed to make going on easier. She still had
to look up to meet their eyes, but she did it proudly, head high,
and she did not have to force the words at all. &ldquo;I have <em>
toh</em>.&rdquo; Her stomach was not fluttering any longer. &ldquo;I ask the
favor, that you will help me meet my <em>toh</em>.&rdquo; Salidar was
going to have to wait.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Leaning on his elbow, Mat examined the game of Snakes
and Foxes laid out on the tent floor. Occasionally a drop of sweat
fell from his chin, just missing the board. It was not a board at
all, really, just a piece of red cloth with the web of lines drawn
in black ink, and arrows showing which lines allowed movement only
one way and which both. Ten pale wooden discs each with an inked
triangle were the foxes, ten with a wavy line the snakes. Two lamps
set to either side gave more than enough light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will win this time, Mat,&rdquo; Olver said excitedly.
 &ldquo;I know we will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Mat said. Their two black-stained discs were
nearly back to the circle in the middle of the board, but the next
roll of the dice would be for the snakes and foxes. Most of the
time you did not make it as far as the outer edge. &ldquo;Roll the dice.&rdquo;
He never touched the dice cup himself, not since the day he had
given it to the boy; if they were going to play the game, it might
as well be without his luck taking a hand.</p>

<p>With a grin, Olver rattled the leather cup and
spilled out the wooden dice his father had made. He groaned as he
counted the pips; this time three dice showed faces marked with a
triangle, the other three wavy lines. On their turn you had to move
the snakes and foxes toward your own pieces by the shortest path,
and if one landed on the point you occupied&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a snake touched
Olver, a fox Mat, and Mat could see if the rest of the pips had
been played, two more snakes would have reached him.</p>

<p>Only a child&rsquo;s game, and one you would not win
so long as you followed the rules. Soon Olver would be old enough
to realize that, and like other children, stop playing. Only a
child&rsquo;s game, but Mat did not like the fox getting him, and
even less the snakes. It brought back bad memories, even if one had
nothing to do with the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Olver muttered, &ldquo;we almost won. Another game,
Mat?&rdquo; Not waiting for an answer, he made the sign that opened the
game, a triangle and then a wavy line through it, then chanted the
words. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Courage to strengthen, fire to blind, music to
dazzle, iron to bind.&rsquo; Mat, why do we say that? There is no
fire, no music and no iron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; The line tickled something in
the back of his head, but he could not bring it up. The old
memories from the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> might as well have been
chosen at random&mdash;they probably had been&mdash;and there
were all those gaps in his own, all those fuzzy places. The boy was
always asking questions he did not know the answer to, usually
beginning with &ldquo;why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Daerid ducked in out of the night and gave a start of
surprise. Face shining with sweat, he still had his coat on, if
hanging undone. His newest scar made a pink furrow across the white
lines crisscrossing his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s past your bedtime, Olver,&rdquo; Mat
said, pushing himself up. His wounds gave a few twinges, but only a
few; they were healing just fine. &ldquo;Put the board up.&rdquo; He stepped
close to Daerid and lowered his voice to a whisper. &ldquo;If you ever
tell about this, I&rsquo;ll cut your throat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Daerid asked dryly. &ldquo;You are turning into a
wonderful father. He shows a remarkable resemblance to you.&rdquo; He
seemed to be struggling with a grin, but a moment later it was
gone. &ldquo;The Lord Dragon is coming into camp,&rdquo; he said, as serious as
death.</p>

<p>Thoughts of punching Daerid in the nose vanished. Mat
pushed the tent flap aside and ducked into the night in his
shirtsleeves. Six of Daerid&rsquo;s men, in a circle around the
tent, stiffened when he appeared. Crossbowmen; pikes certainly
would not be much good for guards. It was night, but not dark in
the camp. The bright glow of a waxing three-quarter moon in a
cloudless sky was washed out by the light of fires spaced among the
rows of tents and men sleeping on the ground. Sentries stood every
twenty paces all the way to the log palisade. Not the way Mat would
have preferred it, but if an attack could pop out of the air&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The land lay nearly flat here, so he had a clear view
of Rand striding toward him. Not alone. Two veiled Aiel moved on
their toes, heads swiveling every time one of the Band rolled over
in his sleep or a sentry shifted his feet to watch them. That Aiel
woman Aviendha was with him as well, a bundle across her back,
stalking along as if she would go for the throat of anyone who got
in her way. Mat did not understand why Rand kept her around. <em>
Aiel women are nothing but trouble</em>, he thought bleakly, <em>
and I&rsquo;ve never seen a woman more set to give trouble than that
one</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that really the Dragon Reborn?&rdquo; Olver asked
breathlessly. Clutching the rolled-up game to his chest, he was
almost bouncing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Mat told him. &ldquo;Now get off to bed. This is
no place for boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olver went, muttering reproachfully, but only as far
as the next tent. Out of the corner of his eye Mat saw the boy dart
out of sight; his face reappeared, peering around the corner.</p>

<p>Mat left him alone, though after getting a good look
at Rand&rsquo;s face, he wondered whether this was any place
for grown men, let alone a boy. That face could have been used to
hammer down a wall, but some emotion struggled to break through,
excitement or maybe eagerness; Rand&rsquo;s eyes held a fevered
light. He had a wide piece of rolled parchment in one hand, while
the other stroked his sword hilt unconsciously. The Dragon belt
buckle glittered in the firelight; sometimes the head of one of the
Dragons peeking out from his coatsleeves did too.</p>

<p>When he reached Mat, he wasted no time with
greetings. &ldquo;I need to talk to you. Alone. I need you to do
something.&rdquo; The night was a black oven, and Rand wore a
gold-embroidered green coat with a high collar, but he was not
sweating a drop.</p>

<p>Daerid, Talmanes and Nalesean stood a few paces away
in various states of undress, watching. Mat motioned them to wait,
then nodded toward his tent. Following Rand in, he fingered the
silver foxhead though his shirt. He had nothing to worry about, at
least. He hoped he did not.</p>

<p>Rand had said alone, but apparently Aviendha did not
think that applied to her. She stayed a firm two paces from him, no
more and no less; mostly she watched Rand with an unreadable face,
but now and then she glanced at Mat, frowning and eyeing him up and
down. Rand paid her no attention, and for all his seeming haste
before, he showed none now. He looked around the tent, though Mat
wondered uneasily whether he was seeing it. There was not much to
see. Olver had set the lamps back on the small folding table. The
chair folded, too, and so did the washstand and the cot. All were
black-lacquered, with lines of gilt; if a man had coin, he might as
well spend it on something. The slits the Aiel had made in the tent
wall had been mended neatly, but they still showed.</p>

<p>The silence dug at Mat. &ldquo;What is this, Rand? I hope
you haven&rsquo;t decided to change the plan at this late date.&rdquo; No
answer, only a look as if Rand had just remembered he was there. It
made Mat nervous. Whatever Daerid and the rest of the Band thought,
he worked hard at keeping clear of battles. Sometimes, though,
being <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> worked against his luck; that was the
way he saw it. He believed Rand had something to do with that; he
was more strongly <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, strong enough that at
times Mat almost felt a pulling. When Rand put his finger in, Mat
would not be surprised to find himself in the middle of a battle if
he was asleep in a barn. &ldquo;A few more days, and I&rsquo;ll be in
Tear. The ferries will take the Band across the river, and a few
days beyond that will see us with Weiramon. It&rsquo;s too bloody
late to go meddling&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to bring Elayne to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to Caemlyn,&rdquo;
Rand broke in. &ldquo;I want you to see her safe to Caemlyn, whatever
happens. Don&rsquo;t leave her side until she&rsquo;s on the Lion
Throne.&rdquo; Aviendha cleared her throat. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Rand said. For some
reason his voice went as cold and hard as his face. But then, did
he need reasons if he was going mad? &ldquo;Aviendha is going with you. I
think it&rsquo;s best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em> think it is best?&rdquo; she said
indignantly. &ldquo;If I had not wakened when I did, I would never have
known you had found her. You do not send me anywhere, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor. I must speak with Elayne for my&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;my own
reasons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very glad you&rsquo;ve found Elayne,&rdquo; Mat said
carefully. If he was Rand, he would leave the woman wherever she
was. Light, Aviendha would be better! At least Aiel women did not
walk around with their noses in the air, or think you should jump
just because they said so. Of course, some of their games were on
the rough side, and they did have the habit of trying to kill you
now and again. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t understand why you need me. Jump
through one of your gateways, give her a kiss, scoop her up and
jump back.&rdquo; Aviendha fastened an outraged stare on him; you would
have thought he had advised kissing her.</p>

<p>Rand unrolled the large parchment on the table, using
the lamps to hold down the ends. &ldquo;This is where she is.&rdquo; It was a
map, a stretch of the River Eldar and maybe fifty miles or so to
either side. An arrow had been drawn in blue ink, pointing into
forest. &ldquo;Salidar&rdquo; was printed beside the arrow. Rand tapped near
the eastern edge of the map. That was wooded, too; most of it was.
 &ldquo;There is a large clearing here. You can see the nearest village is
nearly twenty miles north. I&rsquo;ll put a gateway through to the
clearing for you and the Band.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat managed to turn a wince into a grin. &ldquo;Look, if it
has to be me, why not just me? Make your gateway to this Salidar,
I&rsquo;ll toss her on a horse, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; And what? Was Rand going
to make a gateway from Salidar to Caemlyn as well? It was a long
way to ride, from the Eldar to Caemlyn. A very long way, with only
a snooty noblewoman and an Aiel for company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Band, Mat,&rdquo; Rand snapped. &ldquo;You and the
whole Band!&rdquo; He drew a long shuddering breath, and his tone became
milder. His face did not lose its rigidity, though, and his eyes
were still feverish. Mat could almost believe he was sick, or in
pain. &ldquo;There are Aes Sedai in Salidar, Mat. I don&rsquo;t know how
many; hundreds, I&rsquo;ve heard, but I won&rsquo;t be surprised if
it is closer to fifty. The way they go on about the Tower, whole
and pure, I doubt you&rsquo;ll see more. I mean to put you out two
or three days away so they can learn you&rsquo;re coming. No point
in startling them&mdash;they might think you were a Whitecloak
attack. They&rsquo;re rebels against Elaida, and probably frightened
enough that you won&rsquo;t have to do more than loom a little and
say Elayne has to be crowned in Caemlyn to make them let her go. If
you think they can be trusted, offer your protection. And mine;
they&rsquo;re supposed to be on my side, and they might be glad of
even my protection by now. Then you escort Elayne&mdash;and as
many of the Aes Sedai as want to come&mdash;straight across Altara
and Murandy to Caemlyn. Show my banners, announce what you&rsquo;re
doing, and I don&rsquo;t think the Altarans or Murandians will give
much trouble, not as long as you keep moving. If you find any
Dragonsworn along the way, gather them in as well. Most will
probably turn to bandits if I don&rsquo;t tie a rope to them soon&mdash;I&rsquo;ve heard a rumor or two already&mdash;but you will
draw them, flying my banners.&rdquo; His sudden grin showed teeth, but
never touched those hot eyes. &ldquo;How many birds with one stone, Mat?
You ride through Altara and Murandy with six thousand men and draw
the Dragonsworn out after you, and you may hand me both
countries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was so much in that to set Mat&rsquo;s teeth on
edge that he no longer cared whether Rand had ten sore teeth and
both boots full of cockleburrs. Make Aes Sedai think he meant to
attack them? Indeed not. And he was supposed to intimidate fifty of
them? Aes Sedai did not frighten him, maybe not even five or six
together, but fifty? He touched the foxhead through his shirt again
before he realized it; he might just find out how lucky he really
was. As for riding across Altara and Murandy, he could see it now.
Every noble whose lands he crossed would swell up like a strutting
rooster and try to peck him the moment his back was turned. If that
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> madness came into it, he would probably find
some lord or lady gathering an army right in front of him.</p>

<p>He made one more try. &ldquo;Rand, don&rsquo;t you think
this might draw Sammael&rsquo;s eyes north? You want him looking
east. That is why I&rsquo;m here, remember? To make him look this
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head emphatically. &ldquo;All he&rsquo;ll see
is a guard of honor escorting the Queen of Andor to Caemlyn, and
that&rsquo;s if he learns of it before you reach Caemlyn. How
quickly can you be ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat opened his mouth, then gave it up. He was not
going to budge the man. &ldquo;Two hours.&rdquo; The Band could be booted and
in their saddles faster, but he was in no hurry, and the last thing
he wanted was the Band thinking they were moving on the attack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. I need an hour or so myself.&rdquo; For what, he did
not say. &ldquo;Stay close to Elayne, Mat. Keep her safe. I mean,
there&rsquo;s no point to this if she doesn&rsquo;t reach Caemlyn
alive for her coronation.&rdquo; Did Rand think he did not know about him
and Elayne canoodling in every corner of the Stone the last time
they were together?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll treat her like my own sister.&rdquo; His sisters
had done their best to make his life miserable. Well, he expected
the same from Elayne, just in a different way. Maybe Aviendha would
be a little better. &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t get out of my sight until I
plunk her down in the Royal Palace.&rdquo; <em>And if she tries Mistress
Snoot on with me too often, I&rsquo;ll bloody well kick
her!</em></p>

<p>Rand nodded. &ldquo;That reminds me. Bodewhin is in
Caemlyn. With Verin and Alanna, and some more Two Rivers girls.
They&rsquo;re on their way to train for Aes Sedai. I&rsquo;m not sure
where they will do it; I am certainly not letting them go to the
Tower the way things are. Maybe the Aes Sedai you bring back will
take care of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat gaped. His sister, Aes Sedai? Bode, who used to
run tell their mother every time he did anything that was fun?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another thing,&rdquo; Rand went on. &ldquo;Egwene may be in
Salidar before you. I think somehow they found out she&rsquo;s been
calling herself Aes Sedai. Do what you can to get her out of it.
Tell her I will get her back to the Wise Ones as soon as I can.
She&rsquo;ll probably be more than ready to go with you. Maybe not,
though; you know how stubborn she&rsquo;s always been. The main
thing is Elayne. Remember, don&rsquo;t leave her side till she
reaches Caemlyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; Mat muttered. How under the Light could
Egwene be somewhere on the Eldar? He was sure she had been in
Cairhien when he left Maerone. Unless she had worked out
Rand&rsquo;s trick with the gateways. In which case she could jump
back any time she wished. Or jump to Caemlyn, and make a gateway
for him and the Band at the same time. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about
Egwene, either. I&rsquo;ll drag her out of whatever trouble
she&rsquo;s in, no matter how muley she behaves.&rdquo; It would not be
the first time he had pulled her chestnuts off the hearth before
they burned. Very likely he would get no thanks for it this time
either. <em>Bode</em> was going to be Aes Sedai? <em>Blood and
bloody ashes!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Good.&rdquo; But he was staring
intently at the map. He jerked his eyes away, and for an instant
Mat thought he intended to say something to Aviendha. Instead, he
turned away from her roughly. &ldquo;Thom Merrilin should be with
Elayne.&rdquo; Rand produced a letter from his pocket, folded and sealed.
 &ldquo;See that he gets this.&rdquo; Shoving the letter into Mat&rsquo;s hands,
he hurriedly left the tent.</p>

<p>Aviendha took a step after him, half-raising a hand,
lips parted to speak. Just as suddenly her mouth snapped shut, and
she buried her hands in her skirts and squeezed her eyes shut. So
the wind came that way, did it? <em>And she wants to talk to
Elayne</em>. How did Rand ever get himself in this pickle? Rand was
always the one who knew how to handle women, Rand and Perrin.</p>

<p>Still, it was no concern of his. He turned the letter
over in his hands. Thom&rsquo;s name was written in a feminine hand;
the seal was one he did not recognize, a spreading tree topped by a
crown. What noblewoman would be writing to a leathery old man like
Thom? Not his concern either. Tossing the letter on the table, he
picked up his pipe and pouch. &ldquo;Olver,&rdquo; he said, stuffing the bowl
with tabac, &ldquo;ask Talmanes, Nalesean and Daerid to come to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a squeak just outside the door flap, then,
 &ldquo;Yes, Mat,&rdquo; and the sound of scurrying feet.</p>

<p>Aviendha looked at him, folding her arms with a firm
expression.</p>

<p>He forestalled her. &ldquo;So long as you travel with the
Band, you are under my command. I want no trouble, and I expect you
to see there isn&rsquo;t any.&rdquo; Should she start anything, he would
deliver her to Elayne tied to a packsaddle, if it took ten men to
put her there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know how to follow, battle leader.&rdquo; She punctuated
that with a sharp sniff. &ldquo;But you should know that not all women
are wetlander soft. If you try putting a woman on a horse when she
does not want to go, she may put a knife in your ribs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat nearly dropped the pipe. He knew Aes Sedai could
not read minds&mdash;if they could, his hide would have been
hanging on a wall in the White Tower long since&mdash;but maybe
Aiel Wise Ones&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Of course not. It&rsquo;s just one of those
tricks women pull</em>. He could figure out how she did it if he
put his mind to it. He just did not care to put his mind to it.</p>

<p>Clearing his throat, he stuck the unlit pipe between
his teeth and bent to study the map. The Band could probably cover
the distance from the clearing to Salidar in a day if he pushed,
even in that wooded terrain, but he intended to take two, or even
three. Give the Aes Sedai plenty of warning; he did not want them
any more frightened than they already were. A frightened Aes Sedai
was almost a contradiction. Even wearing the medallion he was not
eager to learn what a frightened Aes Sedai might do.</p>

<p>He felt Aviendha&rsquo;s eyes on the back of his neck,
heard a rasping sound. Sitting cross-legged against the tent wall,
she was drawing her belt knife along a honing stone and watching
him.</p>

<p>When Nalesean entered with Daerid and Talmanes, he
greeted them with, &ldquo;We are going to tickle some Aes Sedai under the
chin, rescue a mule, and put a snip-nosed girl on the Lion Throne.
Oh, yes. That&rsquo;s Aviendha. Don&rsquo;t look at her crosswise, or
she&rsquo;ll try to cut your throat and probably slit her own by
mistake.&rdquo; The woman laughed as if he had made the funniest joke in
the world. She did not stop sharpening her knife, though.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">For a moment Egwene could not understand why the pain
had stopped increasing. Then she pushed herself up from the carpets
of her tent and stood, sobbing so hard she quivered. She wanted
very much to blow her nose. She did not know how long she had been
crying that hard; she only knew she felt on fire from the top of
her hips to the backs of her knees. Standing still was a problem
she barely mastered. The shift she had thought of as scant
protection had been discarded some time back. Tears rolled down her
face, and she stood there and bawled.</p>

<p>Sorilea and Amys and Bair regarded her soberly, and
they were not the only ones, though most of the rest were sitting
about on cushions or stretched out, talking and enjoying tea served
by a slender <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>. A woman, thank the Light.
They were all women, Wise Ones and apprentices, women Egwene had
told she was Aes Sedai. She was grateful that just letting them
think she was did not count; she could not have survived that! It
was the telling, the spoken lie, but there had been surprises.
Cosain, a lean yellow-haired Spine Ridge Miagoma, had said gruffly
that Egwene had no <em>toh</em> toward her but she would stay for
the tea, and so had Estair. Aeron, on the other hand, seemed to
want to cut her in two, and Surandha&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trying to blink away the haze of tears, Egwene
glanced toward Surandha. She was sitting with three Wise Ones,
chatting and occasionally looking in Egwene&rsquo;s direction.
Surandha had been absolutely merciless. Not that any of them had
gone easy. The belt Egwene had found in one of her chests was thin
and supple, but twice as wide as her hand, and these women all had
strong arms. A half-dozen or so strokes from each added up.</p>

<p>Egwene had never felt so ashamed in her life. Not
that she was naked and red-faced and weeping like a baby. Well, the
weeping was part. Not even that they had all watched her strapped,
when not taking their own turns. What shamed her was that she had
taken it so badly. An Aiel child would have been more stoic. Well,
a child would never have had to face it, but the principle was the
simple truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it over?&rdquo; Was that thick, unsteady voice really
hers? How these women would laugh if they knew how carefully she
had gathered her courage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only you know the worth of your honor,&rdquo; Amys said
flatly. She held the belt dangling at her side, using the wide
buckle as a handle. The murmur of conversation had ceased.</p>

<p>Egwene drew a long, shaking breath through her sobs.
All she had to do was say it was done, and it was. She could have
said enough after one blow from each woman. She could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wincing, she knelt and stretched herself out on the
carpets. Her hands went beneath Bair&rsquo;s skirts to grasp the
woman&rsquo;s bony ankles through her soft boots. This time she <em>
would</em> hold on to her courage. This time she would not cry out.
This time she would not kick, or thrash about, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the belt
had not hit her yet. Raising her head, she blinked her eyes clear
to glare at them. &ldquo;What are you waiting for?&rdquo; Her voice still
shook, but there was more than a note of anger too. Making her wait
on top of everything else? &ldquo;I have a journey to make tonight, in
case you&rsquo;ve forgotten. Get on with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amys tossed the belt down beside Egwene&rsquo;s head.
 &ldquo;This woman has no <em>toh</em> toward me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This woman has no <em>toh</em> toward me.&rdquo; That was
Bair&rsquo;s thin voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This woman has no <em>toh</em> toward me,&rdquo; Sorilea
said forcefully. Bending, she smoothed damp hair from Egwene&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;I knew you were Aiel in your heart. Do not be overproud now,
girl. You have met your <em>toh</em>. Get up before we think you
are boasting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they were helping her to her feet, hugging her
and wiping away her tears, holding a handkerchief for her to
finally blow her nose. The other women gathered around, each
announcing that this woman had no <em>toh</em> toward her before
adding her own hugs and smiles. It was the smiles that were the
biggest shock; Surandha beamed at her as brightly as ever. But of
course. <em>Toh</em> did not exist once it was met; whatever earned it might
as well never have happened. A bit of Egwene that was not wrapped
up in <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em> thought that maybe what she had
said at the end helped, too, as well as getting back down in the
first place. Perhaps she had not faced it with the indifference of
an Aiel in the beginning, but at the end, Sorilea was right. She
had been Aiel in her heart. She thought a part of her heart always
would be Aiel.</p>

<p>The Wise Ones and apprentices left slowly. Apparently
they should remain the rest of the night or longer, all laughing
and talking with Egwene, but that was just custom, not <em>
ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>, and with Sorilea&rsquo;s help she managed
to convince them that she just did not have the time. At last it
was only her, Sorilea and the two dream walkers. All the hugs and
smiles had slowed her tears to a trickle, and if her lips still
trembled no matter what she did, she could still smile. In truth,
she wanted to cry again, if for a different reason. Partly for a
different reason; she was on fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to miss all of you so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense.&rdquo; Sorilea snorted for emphasis. &ldquo;If you
have luck, they will tell you you can never be Aes Sedai now. Then
you can return to us. You will be my apprentice. In three or four
years, you will have your own hold. I even know the husband for
you. My greatdaughter Amaryn&rsquo;s youngest greatson, Taric. He
will be a clan chief one day, I think, so you must watch for a
sister-wife to be his roofmistress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Egwene laughed. It seemed she had
something to fall back on if the Hall in Salidar did send her
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Amys and I will meet you in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>,&rdquo; Bair said, &ldquo;and tell you what we
know of events here, and with Rand al&rsquo;Thor. You will go your
own way in the World of Dreams now, but if you wish it, I will
still teach you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do wish it.&rdquo; If the Hall let her anywhere near
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. But then, they could not keep
her out; whatever they did, they could not do that. &ldquo;Please keep a
close eye on Rand and the Aes Sedai. I don&rsquo;t know what he is
playing, but I&rsquo;m sure it is more dangerous than he
thinks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amys said nothing about more teaching, of course. She
had given her word on a course of action, and even meeting <em>toh</em> did
not erase that. Instead, she said, &ldquo;I know Rhuarc will regret not
being here tonight. He has gone north to look at the Shaido for
himself. Do not be afraid your <em>toh</em> toward him must go
unmet. He will give you the opportunity when you meet once
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene gaped, and covered by blowing her nose for
what seemed the tenth time. She had forgotten all about Rhuarc. Of
course, nothing said she <em>had</em> to pay her obligation to him
in the same way. Maybe her heart was at least partly Aiel, but for
a moment her mind sought frantically for another method. There had
to be one. And she would have plenty of time to find it before
seeing him again. &ldquo;I will be very grateful,&rdquo; she said faintly. And
there was Melaine, too. And Aviendha. Light! She had thought she
was done with it. Her feet kept shifting no matter how hard she
tried to hold still. There had to be another way.</p>

<p>Bair opened her mouth, but Sorilea cut her off. &ldquo;We
must let her clothe herself. She has a journey to begin.&rdquo;
Bair&rsquo;s thin neck stiffened, and Amys&rsquo; mouth turned down.
Clearly neither liked what Egwene was going to try any more than
before.</p>

<p>Maybe they meant to stay and try talking her out of
it, but Sorilea began muttering only half under her breath about
fools who tried to stop a woman from doing what she thought she had
to do. The younger pair straightened their shawls&mdash;Bair had
to be seventy or eighty, but she certainly still was younger than
Sorilea&mdash;gave Egwene a farewell hug and left with murmurs of,
 &ldquo;May you always find water and shade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sorilea waited only a moment longer. &ldquo;Think on Taric.
I should have asked him to the sweat tent so you could see him.
Until you can, remember this. We are always more afraid than we
wish to be, but we can always be braver than we expect. Hold on to
your heart, and the Aes Sedai cannot harm what is really you, your
heart. They are not nearly so far above us as we believed. May you
always find water and shade, Egwene. And always remember your
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alone, Egwene merely stood for a time, staring at
nothing and thinking. Her heart. Perhaps she did have more courage
than she thought. She had done what she had to do here; she had
been Aiel. In Salidar, she was going to need that. Aes Sedai
methods differed from the Wise Ones&rsquo; in some respects, but
they would not go easy if they knew she had called herself Aes
Sedai. If they knew. She could not imagine why else they would
summon her so coldly, but Aiel did not surrender before battle was
joined.</p>

<p>With a start she came to herself. <em>If I&rsquo;m not
going to surrender before fighting</em>, she thought wryly, <em>I
might as well get on to the battle</em>.</p>
