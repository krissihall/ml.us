Vanin was gone to tell the Band to sit tight,
Mat found that not an inn remained in Salidar but was taken over by
Aes Sedai, and the five stables were all full to bursting. Yet when
he slipped a little silver to a narrow-jawed stableman, the fellow
had the sacks of oats and bales of hay shifted from a stone-walled
yard that was fine for six horses. He also showed Mat and the
remaining four men of the Band places to sleep in the loft, which
was little cooler than anywhere else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask for nothing,&rdquo; Mat told his men as he divided the
rest of his coins among them. &ldquo;Pay for everything, and accept no
gifts. The Band isn&rsquo;t going to be beholden to anybody
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His false air of confidence communicated itself to
them, and they did not even hesitate when he ordered them to fix
the banners out the loft door so they hung down in front of the
stable, crimson and white, the black-and-white disc and the Dragon
plain to everybody. On the other hand, the stableman&rsquo;s eyes
bulged, and they almost danced as they demanded to know what Mat
was doing.</p>

<p>He only grinned and tossed the narrow-jawed fellow a
gold mark. &ldquo;Just letting everybody know for sure who&rsquo;s come to
call.&rdquo; He wanted Egwene to realize he was not going to be pushed
around, and sometimes making people see that meant you had to act
like jack-fool.</p>

<p>The trouble was, the banners had no effect. Oh,
everybody who walked by gaped and pointed; a number of Aes Sedai
came just to look, cool-eyed and expressionless, but he more than
half expected an indignant demand to take them down, and that never
materialized. When he returned to the Little Tower, an Aes Sedai
who somehow managed to be prune-faced despite smooth ageless cheeks
shifted her brown-fringed shawl and told him in no uncertain terms
that the Amyrlin Seat was busy; perhaps she could see him in a day
or two. Perhaps. Elayne appeared to have vanished, and so did
Aviendha, but no one was crying murder yet; he suspected the Aiel
might be somewhere having a white dress pulled over her head. All
the same to him if it kept the peace; he did not want to be the one
to tell Rand one had killed the other. He did catch a sight of
Nynaeve, but she ducked around a corner and was gone by the time he
reached it.</p>

<p>He spent most of the afternoon looking for Thom and
Juilin; either one surely could tell him more of what was going on,
and besides, he needed to apologize to Thom for his remarks about
that letter. Unfortunately nobody seemed to know where they were
either. Long before nightfall he concluded that they were being
kept out of his way. Egwene really did mean for him to stew, but he
intended to let her know he was not even simmering. In aid of that,
he went dancing.</p>

<p>It seemed that celebrations over a new Amyrlin were
supposed to go on for a month, and though everyone in Salidar
seemed to be working at a run during the day, once darkness fell
bonfires were lit at every street crossing, and fiddles and flutes
appeared and even a dulcimer or two. Music and laughter filled the
air, and festival reigned until bedtime. He saw Aes Sedai dancing
in the streets with carters and stablemen still in their rough
clothes, and Warders dancing with serving women and cooks who had
put aside their aprons. No Egwene, though; the Amyrlin bloody Seat
was not going to caper in the streets. No Elayne or Nynaeve,
either, and no Thom or Juilin. Thom would not have missed a dance
with both legs broken unless he was deliberately kept away. Mat
settled down to enjoy himself, to let everybody see he had not a
care in the world. It did not work exactly as he wished.</p>

<p>He danced a short time with the most beautiful woman
he had ever seen in his life, a slim yet buxom armful who wanted to
know all about Mat Cauthon. Very flattering, especially when she
had asked him to step out. But after a while he noticed that Halima
had a way of brushing against him, a way of leaning to look at
something so he could not help seeing down her dress. He might have
enjoyed it, if not for the fact that she glanced at his face every
time with a sharp eye and an amused smile. She was not a very good
dancer&mdash;she kept trying to lead, for one thing&mdash;and he
finally begged off.</p>

<p>It should have been nothing, but before he had gone
ten paces the foxhead went icy cold on his chest. He spun around,
looking furiously for anything at all. What he saw was Halima
staring at him in the firelight. Only for an instant before she
seized a tall Warder&rsquo;s arm and whirled back into the dance,
but he was sure he had seen shock on that beautiful face.</p>

<p>The fiddles were wailing a tune he recognized. At
least, one of his old memories did, not very much changed
considering the passage of well over a thousand years. The words
must have changed altogether, for the old words that echoed in his
head would never have found favor here.</p>

<p class="verse">Give me your trust, said the Aes Sedai.<br>
 On my shoulders I support the sky.<br>
 Trust me to know and to do what is best,<br>
 And I will take care of the rest.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but trust is the color of a dark seed growing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trust is the color of a heart&rsquo;s blood flowing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trust is the color of a soul&rsquo;s last breath.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trust is the color of death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aes Sedai?&rdquo; a plump young woman said contemptuously
to his question. She was pretty, and he might have tried for a bit
of kiss and cuddle in different circumstances. &ldquo;Halima&rsquo;s just
Delana Sedai&rsquo;s secretary. Always teasing the men, she is. Like
a child with a new toy; teasing just to see if she can. She&rsquo;d
be in hot water to her neck ten times over if Delana didn&rsquo;t
protect her.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="verse">Give me your trust, said the queen on her throne,<br>
 for I must bear the burden all alone.<br>
 Trust me to lead and to judge and to rule,<br>
 and no man will think you a fool.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but trust is the sound of the grave-dog&rsquo;s bark.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trust is the sound of betrayal in the dark.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trust is the sound of a soul&rsquo;s last breath.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trust is the sound of death.</p>

<p>Maybe he had been mistaken. Maybe she had just been
shocked that he walked off. Not many men would walk away from a
woman who looked like that, no matter how she teased or danced.
That had to be it. But that left the question of who and why. He
looked around, at the dancers, and the people watching from the
edge of the shadows and waiting their turns. The golden-haired
Hunter for the Horn who had seemed familiar went spinning by with a
particularly lumpy-faced fellow, her braid almost standing out
behind her. Mat could pick out Aes Sedai by their faces&mdash;most
of them he could&mdash;but there was no way to tell which had
tried to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;whatever it was she had tried.</p>

<p>He strode on down the street to the next bonfire as
much to get away from that song as anything, before it went on
through &ldquo;the king on high&rdquo; and &ldquo;the lady and lord&rdquo; to &ldquo;the love of
your life&rdquo; in his head. In that old memory he remembered writing
that song, because of the love of his life. <em>Trust is the taste
of death</em>. At that next corner a fiddler and a woman with a
flute were playing what sounded like &ldquo;Fluff the Feathers,&rdquo; a good
country dance.</p>

<p>How far could he trust Egwene? She was Aes Sedai now;
she must be, if she was Amyrlin, even a ragtag Amyrlin in a ragtag
village. Well, whatever she was, she was Egwene; he could not
believe she would strike at him out of the dark that way. Of
course, Nynaeve might, though not to injure him really. His hip
still hurt, though; the bruise had made a knot. And the Light only
knew what a woman like Elayne might do. They were still trying to
chase him away, he decided. He could probably expect more attempts.
The best thing was to ignore them; he almost hoped they did try
again. They could not touch him with the Power, and the more they
tried and failed, why, the more they would have to see he was not
to be budged.</p>

<p>Myrelle came to stand beside him, watching the
dancers. He remembered her, vaguely. He did not think she knew
anything dangerous about him. He did not think so. She was not as
beautiful as Halima, of course, but still much more than merely
pretty. Flickering shadows washed her face so he could almost
forget she was Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A warm night,&rdquo; she said, smiling, and went on in
such a casual way while he enjoyed looking at her that it took him
some time to realize what she was getting at.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; he said politely when she
gave an opening. This was what came of forgetting; Aes Sedai were
Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>She only smiled. &ldquo;There would be many advantages, and
I would not try to pin you to my skirts. Many advantages.
You&rsquo;ve chosen a perilous life, or had it chosen for you. A
Warder might have a better chance of survival.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t think so. No, but thank you for
the offer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think on it, Mat. Unless&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;has the Amyrlin
bonded you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Egwene would not do that. Would she? She could
not so long as he wore the medallion, but would she if he did not
have it? &ldquo;If you will excuse me?&rdquo; He gave her a shallow bow and
walked quickly to where a pretty, blue-eyed young woman was tapping
her foot to the music. She had a sweet mouth, just right for
kissing, and he bloody well wanted to enjoy himself. &ldquo;I saw your
eyes, and I couldn&rsquo;t help coming over. Will you dance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Too late he saw the Great Serpent ring on her right
hand, and then that sweet mouth opened and a voice he recognized
said dryly, &ldquo;I asked you once whether you&rsquo;d be there when the
house was burning down, boy, but it seems you make a habit of
jumping into fires. Now go away and find somebody who wants to
dance with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan Sanche! She was stilled and dead! She was
glaring at him with some young woman&rsquo;s face she had stolen,
was what she was, and wearing an Aes Sedai ring! He had asked <em>
Siuan Sanche</em> to dance!</p>

<p>While he was still staring, a willowy young Domani
woman swirled up in a pale green dress thin enough for the light of
the bonfire to silhouette her through it. Giving Siuan a frosty
look that was returned with interest, the Domani all but snatched
him out among the dancers. She was as tall as an Aiel woman, dark
eyes actually a little higher than his. &ldquo;I am Leane, by the way,&rdquo;
she said in a voice like a honeyed caress, &ldquo;in case you did not
recognize me.&rdquo; Her low laugh was almost a caress too.</p>

<p>He jumped and nearly fumbled the first turn. She also
wore the ring. He moved by rote. Tall or not, she was a feather in
his hands, a gliding swan, but that was certainly not enough to
stop the question that kept popping in his head like an
Illuminator&rsquo;s fireworks. How? How under the Light? To top it
all, when the dance was done, she said, &ldquo;You are a very good
dancer,&rdquo; in that stroking voice, and then kissed him about as
thoroughly as he had ever been kissed. He was so shocked he did not
even try to get away. Sighing, she patted his cheek. &ldquo;A very good
dancer. Think of it as dancing next time, and you will do better.&rdquo;
And off she went laughing, back into the dance with some fellow she
snagged from the onlookers.</p>

<p>Mat decided he had had as much as one man could take
in a night. He went back to the stable and went to sleep, with his
saddle for a pillow. His dreams would have been pleasant, except
that they all involved Myrelle and Siuan and Leane and Halima. When
it came to dreams, a man just naturally lacked the sense to pour
water out of a boot.</p>

<p>The next day had to be better, he thought, especially
when dawn found Vanin in the loft, asleep on his saddle. Talmanes
understood and would hold where he was; Warders had been seen
watching the Band&rsquo;s preparations, no doubt letting themselves
be seen, but no one had come near the Band. A less pleasant
surprise was finding Olver&rsquo;s gray in the yard behind the
stable, and Olver himself curled up in his blankets in a
corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need somebody to watch your back,&rdquo; he told Mat
darkly. &ldquo;She cannot be trusted.&rdquo; There was no need for him to name
Aviendha.</p>

<p>Olver had no interest in playing with the children in
the village, so Mat had to endure the stares and smiles as the boy
trailed him around Salidar, doing his best to imitate a
Warder&rsquo;s flowing stride and looking nine ways at once for
Aviendha. Who was still nowhere to be seen, any more than Elayne or
Nynaeve. And &ldquo;the Amyrlin&rdquo; was still busy. Thom and Juilin were
also &ldquo;busy.&rdquo; Vanin managed to hear a few things, but nothing that
made Mat happy. If Nynaeve had really Healed Siuan and Leane, she
would be worse than ever; she had always had a large opinion of
herself, and after doing what could not be done, her head would be
bigger than a dew melon. Yet that was the mildest of it. Logain and
the Red Ajah made Mat wince. That sounded the sort of thing no Aes
Sedai would forgive. If Gareth Bryne was leading their army, it was
no mob of farmers and street sweepings with a few Warders for
stiffening. Add in the foodstuffs Vanin saw being wrapped or stuck
in barrels for travel, and it sounded like trouble. The worst kind
of trouble Mat could imagine, short of finding one of the Forsaken
across the table from him and a dozen Trollocs coming in the door.
None of it made them any less fools; it made them very dangerous
fools. Thom and his &ldquo;help them make it work.&rdquo; If the gleeman ever
came out of hiding, maybe he could pull a &ldquo;how&rdquo; out of one of his
tales.</p>

<p>In the evening Myrelle spoke to him again about
becoming a Warder, and went a little tight around the eyes when he
told her hers would be the fifth offer he had refused since sunup.
He was not sure she believed him; she flounced off in as much of a
huff as he had ever seen from an Aes Sedai. It was true, though.
The very first, while he was still trying to eat breakfast, had
been the very Delana that Halima worked for, a stout pale-haired
woman with watery blue eyes who came close to trying to bully him
into it. That night he stayed away from the dancing and went to
sleep with music and laughter in his ears; they sounded sour this
time.</p>

<p>It was mid-afternoon of his second full day in
Salidar when a girl in a white dress, pretty and freckled and
working very hard at an icy dignity that she almost reached, found
him with a summons, and it was exactly that. &ldquo;You will present
yourself before the Amyrlin Seat at once.&rdquo; Full stop, and not
another word. Mat motioned her to lead; it seemed proper, and she
seemed to like doing it.</p>

<p>They were all there in that room in the Little Tower,
Egwene and Nynaeve, Elayne and Aviendha, though he had to look
twice to recognize the Aiel woman in a blue dress of fine wool with
a lace collar and cuffs. At least neither Aviendha nor Elayne was
trying to strangle the other, but they were both stony-faced. Which
made them no different from Egwene and Nynaeve. Not a flicker of
expression in the four, and all eyes on him. He managed to hold his
tongue while Egwene laid out his choices as she saw them, sitting
behind the table with that striped stole draped on her
shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should you think you can do neither,&rdquo; she finished,
 &ldquo;remember that I can have you tied to your horse and returned to
your Band of the Hand. There is no room in Salidar for slackers and
malingerers. I will not allow it. For you, Mat, it&rsquo;s either
Ebou Dar with Elayne and Nynaeve, or off to see who you can impress
with flags and banners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which really left no choice at all, of course. When
he said so, nobody&rsquo;s expression changed. If anything, Nynaeve
grew more wooden. And Egwene just said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that is
done, Mat. Now, I have a thousand things to do. I will try to see
you before you go.&rdquo; Dismissed like a stableboy; the Amyrlin was
busy. The least she could have done was toss him a copper.</p>

<p>That was why Mat&rsquo;s third morning in Salidar
found him just outside it, on the cleared ground between village
and forest. &ldquo;They may stay right here till I get back,&rdquo; he told
Talmanes, glancing over his shoulder toward the houses. They would
be coming soon, and he did not want any of this getting back to
Egwene. She would try to drive a spike through it if she could. &ldquo;I
hope so, anyway. If they move, follow wherever they go, but never
close enough to frighten. And if a young woman named Egwene shows
up, you ask no questions, just take her and ride to Caemlyn if you
have to cut a hole through Gareth Bryne.&rdquo; Of course, they might be
intending to go to Caemlyn; there might be a chance. He was afraid
it was Tar Valon they were aiming at, though; Tar Valon and the
headsman&rsquo;s axe. &ldquo;And take Nerim with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Talmanes shook his head. &ldquo;If you are taking Nalesean,
I will be offended if you do not let me send my man to care for
your things.&rdquo; Mat wished Talmanes would smile once in a while; it
would help to know when he was serious. He certainly sounded
serious.</p>

<p>Nerim stood a little distance off, with Pips, and his
own short plump brown mare towering over him, and two packhorses
with wicker panniers stuffed to the top. Nalesean&rsquo;s man, a
stout fellow named Lopin, only led one pack animal in addition to
his hammer-nosed gelding and Nalesean&rsquo;s tall black
stallion.</p>

<p>That was not all the party. No one seemed ready to
tell him more than where to be and when, but in the middle of yet
another talk about becoming a Warder, Myrelle had let him know it
was now all right for him to communicate with the Band so long as
he did not try to bring them nearer Salidar. That had been the last
thing in his mind. Vanin was there this morning because he could
probably spy out the lay of the land anywhere, and a dozen
cavalrymen chosen from the Band for heavy shoulders and having kept
order well as Redarms back in Maerone. From what Nalesean said,
quick fists and cudgels should be able to quell any inconvenience
Nynaeve and Elayne got into, at least long enough to spirit them
away. Last of all was Olver on the gray he had named Wind, which
the leggy animal might even deserve. Olver had been no hard choice.
The Band might well find trouble if they actually had to follow
that lot of madwomen. Maybe not trouble with Bryne, but enough
nobles would bristle at two armies crossing their lands to provide
nightly attempts at the horses and arrows flying from every second
thicket. Any city had to be safer than that for a boy.</p>

<p>Still no sign of any Aes Sedai, and the sun beginning
to bake above the treetops.</p>

<p>Mat jerked his hat down irritably. &ldquo;Nalesean knows
Ebou Dar, Talmanes.&rdquo; The Tairen grinned through his sweat and
nodded. Talmanes&rsquo; face did not change. &ldquo;Oh, all right. Nerim
comes.&rdquo; Talmanes inclined his head; maybe he had been serious.</p>

<p>At last there was a stir in the village, a group of
women leading horses. Not just Elayne and Nynaeve, though he had
not expected anyone else. Aviendha wore a gray riding dress, but
she looked at her lean dun mare more than doubtfully. That Hunter
with the golden braid showed more confidence with a heavy-haunched
mouse-colored gelding and seemed to be trying to convince Aviendha
of something about her mare. What was either of them doing there?
There were two Aes Sedai, as well&mdash;other Aes Sedai besides
Nynaeve and Elayne, he supposed he should say&mdash;slender women
with white hair, which he had not seen on an Aes Sedai before. An
old fellow trailed after them with a packhorse in addition to his
own mount, a stringy man without much hair and that gray. It took
Mat a moment to realize he was a Warder, with one of those
color-shifting cloaks hanging down his back. That was what being a
Warder meant; Aes Sedai worked you till your hair fell out, then
probably worked your bones after you were dead.</p>

<p>Thom and Juilin came not far behind, and they had a
packhorse too. The women stopped some fifty paces to the left with
their aged Warder, not so much as looking at Mat and his men. The
gleeman glanced at Nynaeve and the others, then spoke to Juilin,
and they led their horses toward Mat, stopping short as if
uncertain of their welcome. Mat went to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to apologize, Mat,&rdquo; Thom said, knuckling his
mustaches. &ldquo;Elayne put it in no uncertain terms that I wasn&rsquo;t
to talk with you further. She only relented this morning. In a weak
moment some months back I promised to follow her orders, and she
flings it in my face at the most awkward times. She wasn&rsquo;t
very pleased that I had said as much as I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve threatened to punch my eye if I went near
you,&rdquo; Juilin said glumly, leaning on his bamboo staff. He was
wearing a red Taraboner cap that could not give much protection
from the sun, and even that looked glum.</p>

<p>Mat looked toward the women. Nynaeve was peeking at
him over her saddle, but when she saw him looking, she ducked
behind her horse, a plump brown mare. He would not have thought
even Nynaeve could beat Juilin down, but the dark thief-taker was a
far cry from the man he had known briefly in Tear. That Juilin had
been ready for anything; this Juilin, with a permanently furrowed
brow, looked as if he never stopped worrying. &ldquo;We will teach her
some manners this trip, Juilin. Thom, I&rsquo;m the one has to
apologize. What I said about the letter. It was the heat talking,
and worry over fool women. I hope it was good news.&rdquo; Too late he
remembered what Thom had said. He had left the woman who wrote that
letter to die.</p>

<p>But Thom only shrugged. Mat did not know what to make
of him without his gleeman&rsquo;s cloak. &ldquo;Good news? I haven&rsquo;t
puzzled that out yet. Often you don&rsquo;t know whether a woman is
friend, enemy or lover until it is too late. Sometimes, she is all
three.&rdquo; Mat expected a laugh, but Thom frowned and sighed. &ldquo;Women
always seem to like making themselves mysterious, Mat. I can give
you an example. Do you remember Aludra?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat had to think. &ldquo;The Illuminator we kept from
getting her throat slit in Aringill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very one. Juilin and I met her during our
travels, and she didn&rsquo;t know me. Not that she failed to
recognize me; you say things to a stranger you travel with, to get
to know them. Aludra did not want to know me, and even if I
didn&rsquo;t know why, I saw no reason to impose. I met her a
stranger and left her a stranger. Now, would you call her a friend
or an enemy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe a lover,&rdquo; Mat said dryly. He would not mind
meeting Aludra again; she had given him some fireworks that proved
very useful. &ldquo;If you want to know about women, ask Perrin, not me.
I don&rsquo;t know anything at all. I used to think Rand knew, but
Perrin surely does.&rdquo; Elayne was talking with the two white-haired
Aes Sedai under the Hunter&rsquo;s watchful eye. One of the older
Aes Sedai gazed in Mat&rsquo;s direction consideringly. They had the
same sort of bearing Elayne did, cool as a queen on her bloody
throne. &ldquo;Well, with luck I won&rsquo;t have to put up with them
long,&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;With luck; whatever they&rsquo;re
doing won&rsquo;t take long, and we can be back here in five or ten
days.&rdquo; With luck, he might be back before the Band had to begin
shadowing the madwomen. Tracking not one army but two would be easy
as stealing a pie, of course, but he did not look forward to any
more days in Elayne&rsquo;s company than necessary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten days?&rdquo; Thom said. &ldquo;Mat, even with this
&lsquo;gateway&rsquo; it will take five, or six just to reach Ebou
Dar. Better than twenty or so, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat stopped listening. Every shred of irritation that
had been building since he first laid eyes on Egwene again came to
a head at once. Snatching off his hat, he stalked to where Elayne
and the others were. Keeping him in the dark was bad enough&mdash;how was he supposed to keep them out of trouble when they told him
nothing?&mdash;but this was ridiculous. Nynaeve saw him coming and
darted behind her mare for some reason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be interesting traveling with a <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em>,&rdquo; one of the white-haired Aes Sedai said. Up
close, he still could not fasten any age to her, yet somehow her
face conveyed an impression of long years. It must have been the
hair. She could have used the other for a mirror; maybe they really
were sisters. &ldquo;I am Vandene Namelle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat was in no mood to talk about being <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em>. He was never in that mood, but certainly not
now. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this nonsense I hear about five or six days to
reach Ebou Dar?&rdquo; The old Warder straightened, staring hard, and Mat
reevaluated him as well; stringy, but hard as old roots. It made no
difference in his tone. &ldquo;You can open a gateway in sight of Ebou
Dar. We aren&rsquo;t any bloody army to scare anyone, and as for
popping out of air, you&rsquo;re Aes Sedai. People expect you to pop
out of air and walk through walls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear you are speaking to the wrong one of us,&rdquo;
Vandene said. He looked at the other white-haired woman, who shook
her head as Vandene said, &ldquo;Nor Adeleas, I fear. It appears we are
not strong enough for some of the new things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat hesitated, then settled his hat low and turned to
Elayne.</p>

<p>Her chin came up. &ldquo;Apparently you know rather less
than you believe, Master Cauthon,&rdquo; she said coolly. She was not
sweating, he realized, no more than the two&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the other two&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Aes Sedai. The Hunter was staring at him challengingly. What had
put a bee in her ear? &ldquo;There are villages and farms around Ebou Dar
for a hundred miles,&rdquo; Elayne went on, explaining the obvious to a
fool. &ldquo;A gateway is quite dangerous. I do not intend to kill some
poor man&rsquo;s sheep or cows, much less the poor man himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hated more than her tone. She was right, and he
hated that too. He was not about to admit she was, though, not to
her, and searching for a way to retreat, he saw Egwene coming out
of the village with two dozen or more Aes Sedai, most wearing
fringed shawls. Or rather, she came, and they followed. Head held
high, she looked straight ahead, that striped stole hanging about
her neck. The others strolled along behind her in little clumps.
Sheriam, wearing the blue Keeper&rsquo;s stole, was talking with
Myrelle and a bluff-faced Aes Sedai who managed to look motherly.
Except for Delana, he recognized none of the others&mdash;one had
gray hair in a bun; how old did Aes Sedai have to be for their hair
to go completely gray or white?&mdash;but they were all talking
among themselves, ignoring the woman they had named Amyrlin. Egwene
might as well have been alone; she looked alone. Knowing her, she
was trying very hard to be what they had named her, and they let
her walk alone, with everybody watching.</p>

<p><em>To the Pit of Doom with them if they think they
can treat a Two Rivers woman that way</em>, he thought grimly.</p>

<p>Striding to meet Egwene, he swept off his hat and
bowed, making the best leg he knew how, and he could flourish with
the best when he had to. &ldquo;Good morning, Mother, and the Light shine
on you,&rdquo; he said, loud enough to be heard in the village. Kneeling,
he seized her right hand and kissed her Great Serpent ring. A quick
glare and a grimace directed at Talmanes and the others, and hidden
by Egwene from those behind her, had them all scrambling to kneel
and call out, &ldquo;The Light illumine you, Mother,&rdquo; or some variation.
Even Thom and Juilin.</p>

<p>Egwene looked startled at first, though she hid it
quickly. Then she smiled, and said softly, &ldquo;Thank you, Mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment he stared up at her, then cleared his
throat and stood, brushing off his knees. Sheriam and all those
others behind Egwene were staring at him. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect you
out here,&rdquo; he said in a low voice, &ldquo;but then, it seems there are
all sorts of things I didn&rsquo;t expect. Does the Amyrlin always
see people off on trips? You wouldn&rsquo;t by any chance want to
tell me what it&rsquo;s all about now, would you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At first he thought she might; then her mouth
tightened for an instant and she gave a slight shake of her head.
 &ldquo;I will always see friends off, Mat. I&rsquo;d have spoken with you
before this if I was not so busy. Mat, do try to stay out of
trouble in Ebou Dar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stared indignantly. Here he went kneeling and
kissing rings, and she told <em>him</em> to stay out of trouble,
when the whole point was for him to keep Elayne and Nynaeve with
whole skins. &ldquo;I will try, Mother,&rdquo; he said wryly, but not too.
Sheriam and some of those might be close enough to hear. &ldquo;If you
will excuse me, I must see to my men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another bow, and he backed away a few steps before
stalking over to where Talmanes and the rest were still on their
knees. &ldquo;Do you mean to stay there till you take root?&rdquo; he growled.
 &ldquo;Mount up.&rdquo; He followed his own order, and everyone but Talmanes
scrambled into their saddles.</p>

<p>Egwene passed a few words with Elayne and Nynaeve,
while Vandene and Adeleas went to speak to Sheriam, and then it was
time, as quick as that after all their dawdling. Mat half-expected
some sort of ceremony, with Egwene there in the Amyrlin&rsquo;s
stole, but she and the others who were not going merely withdrew a
little distance. Elayne stepped out, and suddenly there was a slash
of light in front of her, widening into a hole, the view through
it, what seemed to be a low hilltop covered in brown grass,
rotating to a halt. Just like when Rand did it. Almost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dismount,&rdquo; Mat ordered. Elayne looked quite pleased
with herself&mdash;you would never suspect the sort of woman she
was from that delighted smile, asking Nynaeve and Aviendha to share
her pleasure&mdash;but pleased or not, the gateway was not as
large as the one Rand had made for the Band. Of course, they were
not nearly so many as the Band, but the least she could have done
was make it tall enough to ride through.</p>

<p>On the other side, low rolling brown-grass hills ran
as far as Mat could see even when he climbed back onto Pips, though
a darkness to the south suggested forest. Dusty hills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must not press the horses too hard in this,&rdquo;
Adeleas said, swinging quite easily onto her round bay mare as soon
as the gateway vanished. The animal looked as if it would be more
at home in a barn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed not,&rdquo; Vandene said. Her mount was a
slab-sided black gelding that had a light step. The pair of them
started south, motioning everyone to follow. The old Warder rode
right at their heels.</p>

<p>Nynaeve and Elayne exchanged irritated looks, then
booted their mares to catch the older women, hooves beating up dust
until they were level. The yellow-braided Hunter dogged them the
way the Warder did the other pair.</p>

<p>Sighing, Mat undid the black kerchief around his neck
and retied it over his nose and mouth. Much as he might enjoy
seeing the older Aes Sedai teach those two to sit up straight, what
he really wanted was an uneventful ride, a short stay in Ebou Dar,
and a quick jump back to Salidar before Egwene did anything stupid
and irretrievable. Women always gave him trouble; he did not
understand it.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">When the gateway winked out, Egwene sighed. Maybe
Elayne and Nynaeve between them could keep Mat from getting into
too much trouble. Keeping him out entirely was probably too much to
ask. She felt a pang of regret for using him, but he might be some
use where he was, and he had had to be gotten away from the Band.
Besides, he deserved it. Maybe Elayne <em>would</em> teach him a
few manners.</p>

<p>Turning to the others, the Hall and Sheriam and her
circle, she said, &ldquo;Now we must get on with what we&rsquo;re
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All eyes went to the Cairhienin in the dark coat just
now mounting his horse near the trees. Talmanes, Egwene thought Mat
had said his name was; she had not dared ask too many questions. He
studied them for a moment and shook his head before riding into the
forest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man who means trouble if I ever saw one,&rdquo; Romanda
said.</p>

<p>Lelaine nodded. &ldquo;It will be well to put miles between
ourselves and that sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene did not let herself smile. Mat&rsquo;s Band had
served its first purpose, but a great deal depended on exactly what
orders Mat had left with this Talmanes. She thought she could
depend on Mat in this. Siuan said that man Vanin had rooted out
things before she had a chance to put them under his nose. And if
she was to &ldquo;come to her senses&rdquo; and run to the Band for protection,
then the Band would have to be close to her. &ldquo;Shall we go to our
horses?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If we leave now, we should catch up to Lord
Bryne well before sunset.&rdquo;</p>
