<h4><em>A Sense of Humor</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
tent&rsquo;s dim interior was hot enough to make
Caemlyn, some eight hundred miles or so north, seem pleasantly
cool, and when Rand pushed the flap open, he blinked. The sun was a
hammer that made him glad of the <em>shoufa</em>.</p>

<p>A copy of the Dragon banner hung above the
green-striped tent, alongside one of the crimson banners bearing
the ancient Aes Sedai symbol. More tents stretched across a rolling
plain where all but a few tufts of tough grass had long since been
beaten to dust by hooves and boots&mdash;peak-roofed tents and
flat, most white by far if often dirty white, but many in colors or
stripes, tents and the colorful banners of lords. An army had
gathered here on the border of Tear, on the edge of the Plains of
Maredo, thousands upon thousands of soldiers from Tear and
Cairhien. The Aiel had made their own camps well away from the
wetlanders, five Aiel for every Tairen and Cairhienin and more
arriving by the day. It was an army to make Illian shake in its
boots, a host already mighty enough to smash anything in its
path.</p>

<p>Enaila and the rest of the foreguard were already
outside, veils down, with a dozen or so Aielmen. The Aiel kept a
constant guard on this tent. Clothed and armed like the Maidens,
they were as tall as Rand or taller, lions to the Maidens&rsquo;
leopards, hard-faced sun-dark men with cold eyes of blue or green
or gray. Today they were <em>Sha&rsquo;mad Conde</em>, Thunder
Walkers, led by Roidan himself, who headed the society this side of
the Dragonwall. The Maidens carried the honor of the <em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, but every warrior society demanded some
share of the guard duty.</p>

<p>One thing about some of the men&rsquo;s garb differed
from the Maidens&rsquo;. Half wore a crimson cloth knotted around
their temples, with the ancient Aes Sedai symbol a black-and-white
disc above their brows. It was a new thing, first seen only a few
months earlier. Wearers of the headband considered themselves <em>
siswai&rsquo;aman</em>; in the Old Tongue, the Spears of the Dragon.
The Spears Owned by the Dragon might be closer. The headbands, and
their meaning, made Rand uncomfortable, but there was little he
could do when the men refused even to admit they were wearing them.
Why no Maidens had donned the things&mdash;none he had seen at
least&mdash;he had no idea. They were almost as reluctant to talk
about it as the men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you, Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; Roidan said gravely.
There was considerably more gray than yellow in Roidan&rsquo;s hair,
but a blacksmith could have used the heavy-shouldered man&rsquo;s
face for hammer or anvil, and by the scars across his cheeks and
nose it seemed possible that more than one had. Icy blue eyes made
his face soft by comparison. He avoided looking at Rand&rsquo;s
sword. &ldquo;May you find shade this day.&rdquo; That had nothing to do with
the molten sun or the cloudless sky&mdash;Roidan did not seem to
sweat at all&mdash;it was simply a greeting among people from a
land where the sun was always baking hot and a tree rare.</p>

<p>Equally formal, Rand replied, &ldquo;I see you, Roidan. May
you find shade this day. Is the High Lord Weiramon about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roidan nodded toward a large pavilion with
red-striped sides and a crimson roof, ringed by men with tall
spears slanted precisely, shoulder-to-shoulder in the burnished
breastplates and gold-and-black coats of Tairen Defenders of the
Stone. Above it, the Three Crescents of Tear, white on red and
gold, and the many-rayed Rising Sun of Cairhien, gold on blue,
flanked Rand&rsquo;s own scarlet flag, all three twitching in a
breeze that might have come from an oven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wetlanders are all there.&rdquo; Looking Rand straight
in the eyes, Roidan added, &ldquo;Bruan has not been asked to that tent
in three days, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo; Bruan was clan chief of the
Nakai Aiel, Roidan&rsquo;s clan; they were both Salt Flat sept. &ldquo;Nor
has Han of the Tomanelle, or Dhearic of the Reyn, or any clan
chief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will speak with them,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Will you tell
Bruan and the others I am here?&rdquo; Roidan nodded gravely.</p>

<p>Eyeing the men sideways, Enaila leaned close to
Jalani, then spoke in a whisper that could have been heard clearly
at ten paces. &ldquo;Do you know why they are called Thunder Walkers?
Because even when they are standing still, you keep looking to the
sky expecting to see lightning.&rdquo; The Maidens hooted with
laughter.</p>

<p>A young Thunder Walker leaped in the air, kicking a
soft knee-high boot higher than Rand&rsquo;s head. He was handsome
except for the puckered white scar that ran up under the strip of
black cloth covering a missing eye. He wore the headband, too. &ldquo;Do
you know why Maidens use handtalk?&rdquo; he shouted at the top of his
leap, and, landing, he put on a befuddled grimace. Not directed at
the Maidens, though; he spoke to his companions, ignoring the
women. &ldquo;Because even when they are not talking, they cannot stop
talking.&rdquo; The <em>Sha&rsquo;mad Conde</em> laughed as hard as the
Maidens had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only Thunder Walkers would see honor in guarding an
empty tent,&rdquo; Enaila told Jalani sadly, shaking her head. &ldquo;The next
time they call for wine, if the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> bring them
empty cups, they will no doubt get drunker than we can on <em>
oosquai</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apparently the Thunder Walkers thought Enaila had
gained the best of the exchange. The one-eyed man and several
others raised their bull-hide bucklers toward her and rattled
spears against them. For her part, she simply listened a moment,
then nodded to herself and fell in with the others as they followed
Rand.</p>

<p>Musing to himself about Aiel humor, Rand studied the
sprawling camp. The aromas of food drifted from hundreds of
scattered cookfires, bread baking in coals, meat roasting on spits,
soup bubbling in kettles hung on tripods. Soldiers always ate well
and often when they could; campaigning usually brought scant meals.
The fires added their own sweetish smells; there was more dried ox
dung to burn on the Plains of Maredo than wood.</p>

<p>Here and there archers or crossbowmen or pikemen
moved about in leather jerkins sewn with steel discs or simply
padded coats, but Tairen and Cairhienin nobles alike despised foot
and lauded horse, so mounted men were most in evidence. Tairens in
helmets rimmed and ridged, and breastplates over fat-sleeved coats
striped in the colors of their various lords. Cairhienin in dark
coats and battered breastplates and helmets like bells cut away to
expose their faces. Small banners called <em>con</em>, on short staffs
fastened to some men&rsquo;s backs, marked minor Cairhienin nobility
and younger sons, and sometimes merely officers, though few
Cairhienin commoners rose to rank. Or Tairen, for that matter. The
two nationalities did not mingle, and while the Tairens often
slouched in their saddles and always directed a sneer at any
Cairhienin who came near, the shorter Cairhien sat their horses
stiffly, as though straining for the last inch of height, and
ignored the Tairens completely. They had fought more than one war
against each other before Rand made them ride together.</p>

<p>Roughly dressed, grizzled old men and some little
more than boys went poking around the tents with stout sticks, one
or another now and again scaring up a rat that he chased down and
clubbed before adding it to the others dangling from his belt. A
big-nosed fellow in a stained leather vest and no shirt, bow in
hand and quiver at his waist, laid a long string of crows and
ravens tied together by the feet on a table in front of one tent
and received a purse in exchange from the bored-looking helmetless
Tarien behind it. Few this far south really believed Myrddraal used
rats and ravens and such for spies&mdash;Light, except for those
who had actually seen them, almost no one this far south truly
believed in Myrddraal, or Trollocs!&mdash;but if the Lord Dragon
wanted the camp kept clear of the creatures, they were happy to
oblige, especially since the Lord Dragon paid in silver for every
corpse.</p>

<p>Cheers rose, of course; no one else would be walking
about with an escort of Maidens of the Spear, and there was the
Dragon Scepter. &ldquo;The Light illumine the Lord Dragon!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Grace
favor the Lord Dragon!&rdquo; and the like showered from every side. Many
even sounded sincere, though it was difficult to tell with men
bellowing at the top of their lungs. Others only stared woodenly,
or turned their horses and rode away, not too fast. After all,
there was no telling when he might decide to call down lightning or
make the ground split open; men who channeled did go mad, and who
knew what a madman might do or when? Whether cheering or not, they
eyed the Maidens warily. Few had really grown accustomed to seeing
women carrying weapons like men; besides, everyone knew Aiel were
every bit as unpredictable as madmen.</p>

<p>The noise was not enough to keep Rand from hearing
what the Maidens were saying behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has a fine sense of humor. Who is he?&rdquo; That was
Enaila.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name is Leiran,&rdquo; Somara replied. &ldquo;A Cosaida
Chareen. You think he has humor because he thought your joke better
than his. He does look to have strong hands.&rdquo; Several of the
Maidens chortled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you not think Enaila funny, Rand al&rsquo;Thor?&rdquo;
Sulin was striding at his side. &ldquo;You did not laugh. You never
laugh. Sometimes I do not think you have a sense of humor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stopping dead, Rand rounded on them so suddenly that
several reached for their veils and looked about for what had
startled him. He cleared his throat. &ldquo;An irascible old farmer named
Hu discovered one morning that his best rooster had flown into a
tall tree beside his farm pond and wouldn&rsquo;t come down, so he
went to his neighbor, Wil, and asked for help. The men had never
gotten along, but Wil finally agreed, so the two men went to the
pond and began climbing the tree, Hu first. They meant to frighten
the rooster out, you see, but the bird only kept flying higher,
branch by branch. Then, just as Hu and the rooster reached almost
the very top of the tree, with Wil right behind, there was a loud
crack, the branch under Hu&rsquo;s feet broke away, and down he went
into the pond, splashing water and mud everywhere. Wil scrambled
down as fast as he could and reached out to Hu from the bank, but
Hu just lay there on his back, sinking deeper into the mud until
only his nose stuck out of the water. Another farmer had seen what
happened, and he came running and pulled Hu out of the pond.
&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you take Wil&rsquo;s hand?&rsquo; he asked Hu.
&lsquo;You could have drowned.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why should I take his
hand now?&rsquo; Hu grumped. &lsquo;I passed him just a moment ago in
broad daylight, and he never spoke a word to me.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; He waited
expectantly.</p>

<p>The Maidens exchanged blank looks. Finally Somara
said, &ldquo;What happened with the pond? Surely the water is the point
of this story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Throwing up his hands, Rand started for the
red-striped pavilion again. Behind him he heard Liah say, &ldquo;I think
it was supposed to be a joke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can we laugh when he doesn&rsquo;t know what
happened to the water?&rdquo; Maira said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the rooster,&rdquo; Enaila put in. &ldquo;Wetlander humor
is strange. I think it was something about the rooster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried to stop listening.</p>

<p>The Defenders stiffened even more rigidly at his
approach, if that was possible, and the two standing before the
gold-fringed entry flaps stepped aside smoothly, pulling them open.
Their eyes stared past the Aiel women.</p>

<p>Rand had led the Defenders of the Stone once, in a
desperate fight against Myrddraal and Trollocs in the halls of the
Stone of Tear itself. They would have followed anyone who stepped
forward to lead that night, but it had been him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Stone still stands,&rdquo; he said quietly. That had
been their battlecry. Quick smiles flashed across some of those
faces before they snapped back to wooden stillness. In Tear
commoners did not smile at what a lord said unless absolutely sure
the lord wanted them to smile.</p>

<p>Most of the Maidens squatted easily outside, spears
across their knees, a posture they could hold for hours without
moving a muscle, but Sulin followed Rand inside with Liah, Enaila
and Jalani. If those Defenders had all been childhood friends of
Rand, the Maidens would have been as cautious, but the men inside
were not friends at all.</p>

<p>Colorful, fringed carpets floored the pavilion,
Tairen mazes and elaborate scrollwork patterns, and in the middle
sat a massive table, heavily carved and gilded and garishly inlaid
with ivory and turquoise, that very likely needed a wagon all to
itself for transport. The map-covered table separated a dozen
sweaty-faced Tairens from half as many Cairhienin, who suffered
even more from the heat, each man holding a golden goblet that
self-effacing servants in black-and-gold livery kept filled with
punch. All the nobles were in silk, but the clean-shaven
Cairhienin, short, slight and pale compared to the men on the other
side of the table, wore coats dark and sober except for bright
horizontal slashes of their House colors across the chest, the
number indicating the rank of the House, while the Tairens, most
with beards oiled and trimmed to neat points, wore padded coats
that were a garden of red and yellow and green and blue, satin and
brocade, silver thread and thread-of-gold. The Cairhienin were
solemn, even dour, most gaunt-cheeked and each with the front of
his head shaved and powdered in what had once been the fashion only
among soldiers in Cairhien, not lords. The Tairens smiled and
sniffed scented handkerchiefs and pomanders that filled the
pavilion with their heavy aromas. Beside the punch, the one thing
they seemed to have in common was flat-eyed stares for the Maidens,
followed hard by the pretense that the Aiel were invisible.</p>

<p>The High Lord Weiramon, oiled beard and hair streaked
gray, bowed deeply. He was one of four High Lords there, in
elaborately silver-worked boots, the others being unctuous, overly
plump Sunamon; Tolmeran, whose iron-gray beard seemed a spear point
on the shaft of his leanness; and potato-nosed Torean, looking more
a farmer than most farmers&mdash;but Rand had given Weiramon the
command. For the time being. The other eight were lesser lords,
some clean-shaven though with no less gray in their hair; they were
here through their oaths of fealty to one or another of the High.
Lords, yet they all had some experience of fighting.</p>

<p>Weiramon was not short for a Tairen, though Rand
stood a head taller, but he always reminded Rand of a banty
rooster, all puffed out chest and strutting. &ldquo;All hail the Lord
Dragon,&rdquo; he intoned, bowing, &ldquo;soon to be Conqueror of Illian. All
hail the Lord of the Morning.&rdquo; The rest were no more than a breath
behind, Tairens spreading arms wide, Cairhienin touching hand to
heart.</p>

<p>Rand grimaced. Lord of the Morning had been one of
Lews Therin&rsquo;s titles, or so the fragmentary histories said. A
great deal of knowledge had been lost in the Breaking of the World,
and more went up in smoke during the Trolloc Wars and later during
the War of the Hundred Years, yet surprising shards sometimes
survived. He was surprised that Weiramon&rsquo;s use of the title
had not brought Lews Therin&rsquo;s mad yammering. Come to think of
it, Rand had not heard that voice since shouting at it. As far as
he could recall that was the first time he had ever actually
addressed the voice sharing his head. The possibilities behind that
sent a chill down his back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Dragon?&rdquo; Sunamon dry-washed fleshy hands. He
seemed to be trying not to see the <em>shoufa</em> wrapped around
Rand&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Are you&mdash;?&rdquo; Swallowing his words, he put on
an ingratiating smile; asking a potential madman&mdash;potential
at the very least&mdash;whether he was well was perhaps not what
he wanted to say. &ldquo;Would the Lord Dragon like some punch? A
Lodanaille vintage mixed with honey-melon.&rdquo; A lanky Lord of the
Land sworn to Sunamon, a man named Estevan with a hard jaw and
harder eyes, motioned sharply, and a servant darted for a golden
goblet from a side table against the canvas wall; another hurried
to fill it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Rand said, then more strongly, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He waved
the servant away without really seeing him. Had Lews Therin
actually <em>heard</em>? Somehow that made the whole thing worse.
He did not want to think about the possibility now; he did not want
to think of it at all. &ldquo;As soon as Hearne and Simaan get here,
almost everything will be in place.&rdquo; Those two High Lords should be
arriving soon; they led the last large parties of Tairen soldiers
to have left Cairhien, over a month ago. Of course, there were
smaller groups on the way south, and more Cairhienin. More Aiel,
too; the stream of Aiel would draw things out. &ldquo;I want to see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly he realized the pavilion had gone very
quiet, very still, except for Torean suddenly tipping back his head
to gulp down the rest of his punch. He scrubbed a hand across his
mouth and held out the goblet for more, but the servants seemed to
be trying to fade into the red-striped walls. Sulin and the other
three Maidens were suddenly up on their toes, ready to veil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked quietly.</p>

<p>Weiramon hesitated. &ldquo;Simaan and Hearne have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;gone to Haddon Mirk. They are not coming.&rdquo; Torean snatched a
worked-gold pitcher from one of the servants and filled his own
goblet, slopping punch onto the carpets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why have they gone there instead of coming
here?&rdquo; Rand did not raise his voice. He was sure he knew the
answer. Those two&mdash;and five more High Lords besides&mdash;had been sent to Cairhien mainly to occupy minds set to plot
against him.</p>

<p>Malicious smiles flickered among the Cairhienin, most
half-hidden in quickly raised goblets. Semaradrid, the
highest-ranking, slashes of color on his coat to below the waist,
wore his sneer openly. A long-faced man with white streaks at his
temples and dark eyes that could chip stone, he moved stiffly from
wounds suffered in his land&rsquo;s civil war, but his limp came
from fighting Tear. His main reason for cooperating with the
Tairens was that they were not Aiel. But then, the Tairens&rsquo;
main reason for cooperating was that the Cairhienin were not.</p>

<p>It was one of Semaradrid&rsquo;s countrymen who
answered, a young lord named Meneril who had half Semaradrid&rsquo;s
stripes on his coat, and on his face a scar from the civil war that
pulled up the left corner of his mouth in a permanent sardonic
smile. &ldquo;Treason, my Lord Dragon. Treason and rebellion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Weiramon might have been hesitant about saying those
words to Rand&rsquo;s face, yet he was not about to let an outlander
speak for him. &ldquo;Yes, rebellion,&rdquo; he said hurriedly, glaring at
Meneril, but his usual pomposity quickly returned. &ldquo;And not only
them, my Lord Dragon. The High Lords Darlin and Tedosian and the
High Lady Estanda are in it, too. Burn my soul, but they all put
their names to a letter of defiance! It seems some twenty or thirty
minor nobles are involved as well, some little more than jumped-up
farmers. Light-blasted fools!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand almost admired Darlin. The man had opposed him
openly from the start, fleeing the Stone when it fell and trying to
rouse resistance among the country nobles. Tedosian and Estanda
were different. Like Hearne and Simaan they had bowed and smiled,
called him Lord Dragon and plotted behind his back. Now his
forbearance was repaid. No wonder Torean was spilling punch over
his white-streaked beard as he drank; he had been involved deeply
with Tedosian, and with Hearne and Simaan for that matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They wrote more than defiance,&rdquo; Tolmeran said in a
cold voice. &ldquo;They wrote that you are a false Dragon, that the fall
of the Stone and your drawing of The Sword That Is Not a Sword were
some Aes Sedai trick.&rdquo; There was a hint of question in his tone; he
had not been in the Stone of Tear the night it fell to Rand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you believe, Tolmeran?&rdquo; It was a seductive
claim in a land where channeling had been outlawed before Rand
changed the law, and Aes Sedai were at best tolerated, where the
Stone of Tear had stood invincible for close to three thousand
years before Rand took it. And a familiar claim. Rand wondered
whether he would find Whitecloaks when these rebels were laid by
the heels. He thought Pedron Niall might be too smart to allow
that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you drew <em>Callandor</em>.&rdquo; The lean man
said after a moment. &ldquo;I think you are the Dragon Reborn.&rdquo; Both
times there was a slight emphasis on &ldquo;think.&rdquo; Tolmeran had courage.
Estevan nodded; slowly, but he did it. Another brave man.</p>

<p>Even they did not ask the obvious question, though,
whether Rand wanted the rebels rooted out. Rand was not surprised.
For one thing, Haddon Mirk was no easy place to root anyone out of,
a huge tangled forest lacking villages, roads or even paths. In the
choppy mountainous terrain along its northernmost edge a man would
be lucky to cover a handful of miles in a long day, and armies
could maneuver until their food ran out without finding one
another. Perhaps more importantly, whoever asked that question
could be suspected of volunteering to lead the expedition, and a
volunteer could be suspected of wanting to join Darlin, not lay him
by the heels. Tairens might not play <em>Daes Dae&rsquo;mar</em>,
the Game of Houses, the way Cairhienin did&mdash;that lot read
volumes in a glance and heard more in a sentence than you ever
meant to put there&mdash;but they still schemed and watched one
another, suspicious of schemes, and they believed everyone else did
the same.</p>

<p>Still, it suited Rand to leave the rebels where they
were for now. All of his attention had to be on Illian; it had to
be seen to be there. But he could not be seen as soft, either.
These men would not turn on him, but Last Battle or no Last Battle,
only two things kept the Tairens and Cairhienin from each
other&rsquo;s throats. They preferred each other to Aielmen, if
barely, and they feared the wrath of the Dragon Reborn. If they
lost that fear, they would be trying to kill one another, and the
Aiel, before you could say Jak o&rsquo; the Mists.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does anyone speak in their defense?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Does
anyone know any mitigation?&rdquo; If any did, they held their tongues;
counting the servants, nearly two dozen pairs of eyes watched him,
waiting. Perhaps the servants most intently of all. Sulin and the
Maidens watched everything <em>except</em> him. &ldquo;Their titles are
forfeited, their lands and estates confiscated. Arrest warrants are
to be signed for every man whose name is known. And every woman.&rdquo;
That could present a problem; the penalty in Tear for rebellion was
death. He had changed some laws, but not that one, and it was too
late now. &ldquo;Publish it that whoever kills one of them will be
absolved of murder, and whoever aids them will be charged with
treason. Any who surrender will be spared their lives,&rdquo; which might
solve the difficulty of Estanda&mdash;he would not order a woman
executed&mdash;if he could work how to manage it, &ldquo;but those who
persist will hang.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The nobles shifted uneasily and exchanged glances,
whether Tairen or Cairhienin. Blood drained from more than one
face. They had certainly expected the death sentences&mdash;there
could be no less for rebellion, and with war in the offing&mdash;but the stripping of titles plainly shocked them. Despite all the
laws Rand had changed in both lands, despite lords hauled before
magistrates and hanged for murder or fined for assault, they still
thought there was some difference bred in the bone, some natural
order that made them lions by right and commoners sheep. A High
Lord who went to the gibbet died a High Lord, but Darlin and the
others would die peasants in these men&rsquo;s eyes, a much worse
fate than the dying itself. The servants remained poised with their
pitchers, waiting to refill any goblet that had to be tilted very
far in drinking. Features as expressionless as ever, there seemed
to be a cheerfulness in some of those eyes not there before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that that&rsquo;s settled,&rdquo; Rand said, dragging
off the <em>shoufa</em> as he went to the table, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s see
the maps. Sammael is more important than a handful of fools rotting
in Haddon Mirk.&rdquo; He hoped they did rot. <em>Burn them!</em></p>

<p>Weiramon&rsquo;s mouth tightened, and Tolmeran quickly
smoothed out a frown. Sunamon&rsquo;s face was so smooth it might
have been a mask. The other Tairens looked as doubtful, and the
Cairhienin as well, though Semaradrid hid it well. Some had seen
Myrddraal and Trollocs during that attack on the Stone, and some
had seen his duel with Sammael at Cairhien, yet they thought his
claim the Forsaken were loose a symptom of insanity. He had heard
whispers that he had wrought all the destruction at Cairhien
himself, striking out maniacally at friend and foe alike. Going by
Liah&rsquo;s stony face, one of them was going to get a
Maiden&rsquo;s spear through him if they did not guard those
looks.</p>

<p>They gathered around the table, though, as he tossed
down the <em>shoufa</em> and rummaged through the maps scattered in
layers. Bashere was right; men would follow madmen who won. So long
as they won. Just as he found the map he wanted, a detailed drawing
of the eastern end of Illian, the Aiel chiefs arrived.</p>

<p>Bruan of the Nakai Aiel was first to enter, followed
closely by Jheran of the Shaarad, Dhearic of the Reyn, Han of the
Tomanelle, and Erim of the Chareen, each acknowledging the nods of
Sulin and the three Maidens. Bruan, a massive man with sad gray
eyes, really was the leader of the five clans Rand had sent south
so far. None of the others objected; Bruan&rsquo;s oddly placid
manner belied his battle skills. Clothed in the <em>
cadin&rsquo;sor</em>, <em>shoufa</em> hanging loose about their
necks, they were unarmed except for their heavy belt knives, but
then, an Aiel was hardly unarmed even when he had only his hands
and feet.</p>

<p>The Cairhienin simply pretended they were not there,
but the Tairens made a point of sneering and sniffing
ostentatiously at their pomanders and scented handkerchiefs. Tear
had lost only the Stone to the Aiel, and that with the aid of the
Dragon Reborn, as they believed&mdash;or of Aes Sedai&mdash;but
Cairhien had twice been ravaged by them, twice defeated and
humiliated.</p>

<p>Except for Han, the Aiel ignored them all. Han,
white-haired and with a face like creased leather, glared
murderously. He was a prickly man at best, and it might not have
helped that some of the Tairens were as tall as he. Han was short
for an Aiel&mdash;which meant well above average for a wetlander&mdash;and as touchy about it as Enaila. And of course, Aiel
despised &ldquo;treekillers,&rdquo; one of their names for Cairhienin, beyond
any other wetlanders. Their other name for them was
 &ldquo;oathbreakers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rsquo;The Illianers,&rdquo; Rand said firmly, smoothing the
map out. He used the Dragon Scepter to hold down one end and a
gold-mounted inkpot and matching sand-bowl for the other. He did
not need these men to start killing each other. He did not think
they would&mdash;while he was there, at least. In stories allies
eventually came to trust and like one another; he doubted these men
ever would.</p>

<p>The rolling Plains of Maredo extended a little
distance into Illian, giving way to forested hills well short of
the Manetherendrelle, and the River Shal branching off from it.
Five inked crosses about ten miles apart marked the eastern edge of
those hills. The Doirlon Hills.</p>

<p>Rand put his finger on the middle cross. &ldquo;Are you
sure Sammael has not added any new camps?&rdquo; A slight grimace on
Weiramon&rsquo;s face made him snap irritably, &ldquo;Lord Brend, if you
prefer, then, or the Council of Nine, or Mattin Stepaneos den
Balgar, if you want the king himself. Are they still like
this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our scouts say so,&rdquo; Jheran said calmly. Slender as a
blade is slender, his light brown hair heavily streaked with gray,
he was always calm now that the Shaarad&rsquo;s four-hundred-year
blood feud with the Goshien Aiel had ended with Rand&rsquo;s coming.
 &ldquo;<em>Sovin Nai</em> and <em>Duadhe Mahdi&rsquo;in</em> keep a close
watch.&rdquo; He nodded slightly in satisfaction, and so did Dhearic.
Jheran had been <em>Sovin Nai</em>, a Knife Hand, before becoming
chief, and Dhearic <em>Duadhe Mahdi&rsquo;in</em>, a Water Seeker.
 &ldquo;We know any changes in five days by runners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My scouts believe they are,&rdquo; Weiramon said as if
Jheran had not spoken. &ldquo;I send a new troop every week. It takes a
full month for them to come and go, but I assure you, I am as
up-to-date as the distance allows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aiel&rsquo;s faces might have been carved from
stone.</p>

<p>Rand ignored the interplay. He had tried before to
hammer shut the gaps between Tairen, Cairhienin and Aiel, and they
always sprang apart as soon as his back turned. It was useless
effort.</p>

<p>As for the camps&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;he knew there were still only
five; he had visited them, in a manner of speaking. There was a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;place&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that he knew how to enter, a strange, unpeopled
reflection of the real world, and he had walked the wooden walls of
those massive hill-forts there. He knew the answers to almost every
question he intended to ask, but he was juggling plans within plans
like a gleeman juggling fire. &ldquo;And Sammael is still bringing more
men up?&rdquo; This time he emphasized the name. The Aiel&rsquo;s
expressions did not change&mdash;if the Forsaken were loose, the
Forsaken were loose; the world had to be faced as it was, not as
you wished it to be&mdash;but the others darted those quick,
worried glances at him. They had to get used to it sooner or later.
They had to believe sooner or later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every man in Illian who can hold a spear without
tripping over it, or so it seems,&rdquo; Tolmeran said with a glum
expression. He was as eager to fight the Illianers as any Tairen&mdash;the two nations had hated each other since they were wrested
from the wreckage of Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s empire; their history
was one of wars fought on the slightest excuse&mdash;but he seemed
a little less likely than the other High Lords to think every
battle could be won by one good charge. &ldquo;Every scout that makes it
back reports the camps larger, with more formidable defenses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should move now, my Lord Dragon,&rdquo; Weiramon said
forcefully. &ldquo;The Light burn my soul, I can catch the Illianers with
their breeches around their ankles. They&rsquo;ve tied themselves
down. Why, they hardly have any horse at all! I&rsquo;ll crush them
in detail, and the way will be open to the city.&rdquo; In Illian, as in
Tear and Cairhien, &ldquo;the city&rdquo; was the city that had given the
nation its name. &ldquo;Burn my eyes, I will put your banner over Illian
in a month, my Lord Dragon. Two at most.&rdquo; Glancing at the
Cairhienin, he added as if the words were being pulled from him,
 &ldquo;Semaradrid and I will.&rdquo; Semaradrid bowed slightly. Very
slightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Rand said curtly. Weiramon&rsquo;s was a plan
for disaster. A good two hundred and fifty miles lay between the
camp and Sammael&rsquo;s great hill-forts across a plain of grass
where a fifty-foot rise was considered a tall hill and a thicket of
two hides a forest. Sammael had scouts, too; any rat or raven could
be one of Sammael&rsquo;s scouts. Two hundred and fifty miles.
Twelve or thirteen days for the Tairens and Cairhienin, with luck.
The Aiel could make it in perhaps five, if they pushed&mdash;a
lone scout or two moved faster than an army, even among Aiel&mdash;but they were no part of Weiramon&rsquo;s design. Long before
Weiramon reached the Doirlon Hills, Sammael would be ready to crush
the Tairen, not the other way around. A fool plan. Even more
foolish than the one Rand had given them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given your
orders. You hold here until Mat arrives to take command, and even
then, no one moves a foot until I think I have enough numbers here.
There are more men on their way, Tairens, Cairhienin, Aiel. I mean
to smash Sammael, Weiramon. Smash him forever, and bring Illian
under the Dragon Banner.&rdquo; That much was true. &ldquo;I only wish I could
be with you, but Andor requires my attention yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Weiramon&rsquo;s face became sour stone,
Semaradrid&rsquo;s grimace should have turned the wine in his punch
to vinegar, and Tolmeran wore such a lack of expression that his
disapproval was plain as a fist in the nose. In Semaradrid&rsquo;s
case, it was the delay that worried. He had pointed out more than
once that if every day brought more men to the camp here, it also
brought more to the forts in Illian. No doubt Weiramon&rsquo;s plan
was the result of his urgings, though he would have made a better.
Tolmeran&rsquo;s doubts centered on Mat. Despite what he had heard
from Cairhienin of Mat&rsquo;s skill in battle, Tolmeran thought it
flattery from fools for a country man who happened to be a friend
of the Dragon Reborn. They were honest objections, and
Semaradrid&rsquo;s even had validity&mdash;if the plan they had
been given had been more than another screen. It was unlikely
Sammael depended entirely on rats and ravens for his spying. Rand
expected there were human spies in the camp for other Forsaken as
well, and probably for the Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It shall be as you say, my Lord Dragon,&rdquo; Weiramon
said heavily. The man was brave enough when it came to battle, but
a pure blind idiot unable to think beyond the glory of the charge,
his hatred of Illianers, his contempt for Cairhienin and Aiel
 &ldquo;savages.&rdquo; Rand was sure Weiramon was exactly the man he needed.
Tolmeran and Semaradrid would not move too soon so long as Weiramon
held the command.</p>

<p>For a long while further they talked and Rand
listened, asking occasional questions. There was no more
opposition, no more suggestions that the attack be made now, no
discussion of the attack at all. What Rand questioned Weiramon and
the others about was wagons, wagons and what was in them. The
Plains of Maredo had few villages and far between, no city except
Far Madding in the north, and barely enough farmland to feed the
people already there, A huge army would need a constant stream of
wagons out of Tear bringing everything from flour for bread to
nails for horseshoes. Except for Tolmeran, the High Lords were of
the opinion that the army could carry what it needed to cross the
plain and then could live off Illian; there seemed to be a certain
relish in the thought of stripping their ancient enemy&rsquo;s lands
to the ground like a swarm of locusts. The Cairhienin had a
different opinion, especially Semaradrid and Meneril. Not only
commoners had gone hungry during Cairhien&rsquo;s civil war and the
Shaido&rsquo;s siege of their capital; their hollow cheeks spoke
eloquently of that. Illian was a fat land, and even the Doirlon
Hills held farms and vineyards, but Semaradrid and Meneril did not
want to trust their soldiers&rsquo; bellies to uncertain forage if
there was another way. As for Rand, he did not want Illian ravaged
any more than could not be avoided.</p>

<p>He did not really press anyone. Sunamon assured him
the wagons were being assembled, and he had long since learned his
lesson about telling Rand one thing and doing another. Supplies
were being gathered all across Tear, despite Weiramon&rsquo;s
grimaces of impatience with the whole notion and Torean&rsquo;s
sweaty mutters about the expense. The important thing, though, was
that the plan he had given them was going forward&mdash;and would
be seen to be going forward.</p>

<p>Leavetaking involved more grandiose prattle and
elaborate bows while he rewound the <em>shoufa</em> around his head
and took up the Dragon Scepter again, with halfhearted invitations
to stay for a banquet and equally insincere offers to attend him to
his departure if he could not remain to eat the feast they would
have prepared. Tairen or Cairhienin, they avoided the company of
the Dragon Reborn as much as they safely could without losing his
favor, while pretending that they did no such thing. Most
especially they wanted to be elsewhere when he channeled. They did
escort him to the entrance and a few steps outside, of course, but
Sunamon sighed audibly when he left them, and Rand heard Torean
actually giggling in relief.</p>

<p>The Aiel chiefs went with Rand silently, and the
Maidens outside joined Sulin and the other three in making a ring
around the six men as they started toward the green-striped tent.
This time there were only a few cheers, and the chiefs said
nothing. They had said almost as little back in the pavilion. When
Rand commented on it, Dhearic said, &ldquo;These wetlanders do not want
to hear us.&rdquo; He was a husky man, within a finger width of
Rand&rsquo;s height, with a big nose and paler streaks prominent in
his golden hair. His blue eyes were filled with contempt. &ldquo;They
hear only the wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did they tell you of those who rebel against you?&rdquo;
Erim asked. Taller than Dhearic, he had a pugnacious jaw and almost
as much white as red in his hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They did,&rdquo; Rand said, and Han frowned at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are sending these Tairens after their own
kind, it is a mistake. Even if they could be trusted, I do not
think they could do it. Send the spears. One clan would be enough
and more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. &ldquo;Darlin and his rebels can wait.
Sammael is what&rsquo;s important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let us go to Illian now,&rdquo; Jheran said. &ldquo;Forget
these wetlanders, Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Already there are nearly two
hundred thousand spears gathered here. We can destroy the Illianers
before Weiramon Saniago and Semaradrid Maravin can be halfway
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Rand squeezed his eyes shut. Was
everyone going to argue with him? These were not men who would give
way at a frown from the Dragon Reborn. The Dragon Reborn was only a
wetlander prophecy; they followed He Who Comes With the Dawn, the
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, and as he had long since grown tired
of hearing, even the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> was not a king.
 &ldquo;I want your word to stay here until Mat tells you to move. A
promise from each of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will stay, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo; Bruan&rsquo;s
deceptively mild voice had a tight edge. The others&rsquo;
agreements came in harder voices, but they came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is wasting time,&rdquo; Han added, twisting his
mouth. &ldquo;May I never know shade if it is not.&rdquo; Jheran and Erim
nodded.</p>

<p>Rand had not expected them to give in so quickly.
 &ldquo;Now and then you have to waste time to save it,&rdquo; he said, and Han
snorted.</p>

<p>Back at the green-striped tent the Thunder Walkers
had lifted up the sides on poles, letting the breeze blow through
the shaded interior. Hot and dry as it was, the Aiel seemed to find
it refreshing. Rand did not think he sweated a drop less than he
had in the sun. He pulled off the <em>shoufa</em> as he settled to
the layered rugs with Bruan and the other chiefs facing him. The
Maidens added their number to the Thunder Walkers around the tent;
every so often banter between them drifted in, and laughter at it.
This time Leiran seemed to be getting the better of it; at least,
the Maidens rattled spears against bucklers at him twice. Rand
understood almost none of it.</p>

<p>Thumbing his short-stemmed pipe full of tabac, he
passed the goatskin pouch around for the chiefs to fill their pipes&mdash;he had found a small cask of good Two Rivers leaf in Caemlyn&mdash;then channeled his alight while they sent a Thunder Walker
for a burning twig from one of the cookfires. When all the pipes
were lit they settled down to talk, puffing contentedly.</p>

<p>The conversation lasted fully as long as his
discussion with the lords, not because there was that much to talk
about but because Rand had talked alone with the wetlanders. Aiel
were touchy about honor; their lives were governed by <em>
ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>, honor and obligation, with rules as
complex and odd as their humor. They talked of the Aiel still on
their way down from Cairhien, of when Mat would arrive and of what
if anything should be done about the Shaido. They talked about
hunting and women and whether brandy was as good as <em>
oosquai</em>, and about humor. Even patient Bruan finally spread
his hands in surrender and gave up trying to explain Aiel jokes.
What under the Light was funny about a woman stabbing her husband
by accident, whatever the circumstances, or a man ending up married
to the sister of the woman he wanted to marry? Han grumped and
snorted and refused to believe Rand did not understand; <em>he</em>
laughed so hard at the one about the stabbing that he nearly fell
over. The one thing they did not talk about was the coming war
against Illian.</p>

<p>When they left, Rand stood squinting at the sun,
halfway down toward the horizon. Han was repeating the story about
the stabbing, and the departing chiefs chuckled over it again.
Tapping his pipe out on the heel of his palm, Rand ground the
dottle underfoot in the dust. There was still time to return to
Caemlyn and meet Bashere, but he went back inside the tent and sat
watching the sun sink. As it touched the horizon, turning red as
blood, Enaila and Somara brought him a plate of mutton stew heaped
high enough for two men, a round loaf of bread and a pitcher of
mint tea that had been set in a bucket of water to cool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not eat enough,&rdquo; Somara said, trying to
smooth his hair before he moved his head away.</p>

<p>Enaila eyed him. &ldquo;If you did not avoid Aviendha so,
she would see that you ate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He attracts her interest, then runs from her,&rdquo;
Somara muttered. &ldquo;You must attract her again. Why do you not offer
to wash her hair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He should not be <em>that</em> forward,&rdquo; Enaila said
firmly. &ldquo;Asking to brush her hair will be more than enough. He does
not want her to think him forward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somara sniffed. &ldquo;She will not think he is forward
when he runs from her. You can be too modest, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do realize that neither of you is my mother,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em>-clad women looked at
each other in confusion. &ldquo;Do you think this is another wetlander
joke?&rdquo; Enaila asked, and Somara shrugged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know. He does not look amused.&rdquo; She patted
Rand on the back. &ldquo;I am sure it was a good joke, but you must
explain it to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand suffered in silence, grinding his teeth, while
they watched him eat. They literally watched every spoonful.
Matters became no better when they left with his plate and Sulin
joined him. Sulin had some blunt, and most improper, advice on how
he could reattract Aviendha&rsquo;s notice; among the Aiel, it was
the sort of thing a first-sister might do for a first-brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be decently modest in her eyes,&rdquo; the
white-haired Maiden told him, &ldquo;but not so modest she thinks you
boring. Ask her to scrape your back in the sweat tent, but shyly,
with your eyes downcast. When you undress for bed, let yourself
dance as if life pleases you, then apologize when you suddenly
realize she is there and put yourself straight into your blankets.
Can you blush?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A great deal of suffering in silence. The Maidens
knew too much, and not enough.</p>

<p>When they returned to Caemlyn, well after the sun had
gone down, Rand crept into his apartment with his boots in his
hands, fumbling his way through the anteroom into his bedchamber in
the dark. Even if he had not known Aviendha would be there, already
on her pallet on the floor by the wall, he would have felt her
presence. In the stillness of the night, he could hear her
breathing. For once it seemed he had managed to wait long enough
for her to fall asleep. He had tried to stop this, but Aviendha
paid him no mind and the Maidens laughed at his &lsquo;shyness&rsquo;
and &lsquo;modesty.&rsquo; Good things in a man when alone, they
agreed, so long as not carried too far.</p>

<p>He climbed into his bed with a sense of relief that
Aviendha was already asleep&mdash;and some disgruntlement that he
dared not light a lamp to wash&mdash;and she turned over on her
pallet. Very likely she had been awake all along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sleep well and wake,&rdquo; was all she said.</p>

<p>Thinking what idiocy it was to feel this sudden
contentment because a woman he wanted to avoid told him good night,
he stuffed a goose-down pillow beneath his head. Aviendha probably
thought this the most marvelous joke; taunting was almost an art
among Aiel, and the nearer it came to bringing blood, the better.
Sleep began to come, and his last conscious thought was that he had
a huge joke of his own, though only he and Mat and Bashere knew it
yet. Sammael had no sense of humor at all, but that great hammer of
an army waiting in Tear was the biggest joke the world had ever
seen. With any luck, Sammael would be dead before he knew he should
laugh.</p>
