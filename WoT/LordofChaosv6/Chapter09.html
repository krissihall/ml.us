<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">Y</span>ou
had these Illuminators brought to Amador?&rdquo; Many
would have flinched to hear such a cold tone from Pedron Niall, but
not the man standing on the inlaid golden sunburst before
Nial&rsquo;s plain high-backed chair. He exuded confidence and
competence. Niall continued, &ldquo;There is a reason I have two thousand
of the Children guarding the border with Tarabon, Omerna. Tarabon
is quarantined. <em>No</em> one is allowed across the border. Not a
sparrow would cross if I had my way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Omerna was the picture of what an officer of the
Children of the Light was supposed to be, tall and commanding, with
a bold, fearless face, a strong chin and waves of white at his
temples. His dark eyes seemed more than capable of surveying the
harshest battlefield undismayed, as indeed they had. At the moment
they seemed to indicate deeply considered thought. The
white-and-gold tabard of a Lord Captain, Anointed of the Light,
suited him. &ldquo;My Lord Captain Commander, they wish to establish a
chapter house here.&rdquo; Even his voice, deep and mellifluous, fit the
image. &ldquo;Illuminators travel everywhere. It should be possible to
slip agents among them easily. Agents welcomed into every town,
every noble&rsquo;s manor, every ruler&rsquo;s palace.&rdquo; Supposedly
Abdel Omerna was a relatively minor member of the Council of
Anointed. In truth, he was the Children of the Light&rsquo;s
spymaster. After a manner of speaking. &ldquo;Think of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>What Niall thought was that the Guild of Illuminators
was Taraboner to the last man and woman, and Tarabon was infected
with chaos and madness that he would not let loose in Amadicia. If
cauterizing that infection had to wait, he could at least isolate
it. &ldquo;They will be treated like anyone else who slips through,
Omerna. Kept under guard, allowed to talk to no one, and escorted
out of Amadicia without delay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I may insist, my Lord Captain Commander, their
usefulness is worth the little gossip they might spread. They keep
to themselves. And aside from their use for my agents, the prestige
of having an Illuminators&rsquo; chapter house in Amador would be
considerable. The only chapter house, now. The one in Cairhien has
been abandoned, and the one in Tanchico surely has been, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prestige! Niall rubbed his left eye to soothe an
involuntary flutter. Little point in getting angry with Omerna, but
restraint took an effort. The morning heat cooked his temper over a
slow fire. &ldquo;They do indeed keep to themselves, Omerna. They live
with their own, travel with their own, and barely speak to anyone
else. Do you mean to have these agents marry Illuminators? They
rarely marry outside their guild, and there is no way to become an
Illuminator except by birth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah. Well. I am sure a way can be found.&rdquo; Nothing
could dent that facade of confidence and competence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It shall be done as I say, Omerna.&rdquo; The man actually
opened his mouth again, but Niall forestalled him irritably. &ldquo;As I
say, Omerna! I&rsquo;ll hear no more on it! Now what information do
you have today? What <em>useful</em> information? That is your
function. Not providing fireworks for Ailron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Omerna hesitated, plainly wanting to make another
plea for his precious Illuminators, but in the end he said
portentously, &ldquo;The reports of Dragonsworn in Altara are more than
rumor, it seems. And perhaps in Murandy as well. The infestation
is small, but it will grow. A strong move now could settle for them
and the Aes Sedai in Salidar in one&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you dictate strategy for the Children now? Gather
information, and leave its use to me. What else do you have for
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man&rsquo;s response to being cut off was a calm
bow of acquiescence. Omerna was very good at remaining calm; it was
perhaps what he did best. &ldquo;I have good news. Martin Stepaneos is
ready to join you. He hesitates to make a public announcement, but
my people in Illian report that he soon will. He is reported
eager.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be remarkably good,&rdquo; Niall said dryly.
Remarkable, certainly. Among the banners and pennants lining the
cornices of the chamber, Martin Stepaneos&rsquo; Three Leopards,
silver on black, hung next to a gold-fringed Illianer Royal
Standard, nine bees worked in thread-of-gold on green silk. The
Illianer king came out on top in the Troubles finally, at least to
the point of forcing a treaty that affirmed the border between
Amadicia and Altara where it was at the beginning, but Niall
doubted the man would ever forget that he had had the advantage of
terrain and numbers at Soremaine and still been defeated and
captured. If the Illianer Companions had not covered the field for
the rest of the army to escape Niall&rsquo;s trap, Altara would be a
fief of the Children today, and very likely Murandy and even
Illian. Worse, Mattin Stepaneos had a Tar Valon witch for an
advisor, though he hid the fact, and her. Niall sent emissaries
because he dared not leave a path untried, but yes, Mattin
Stepaneos joining him willingly would be remarkable indeed.
 &ldquo;Continue. And be brief. I have a busy day today, and I can read
your written reports later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite those instructions Omerna&rsquo;s rendition
was long, delivered in a sonorous voice full of certainty.
Al&rsquo;Thor had barely extended his control in Andor beyond
Caemlyn. His lightning onslaught was clearly stalled at last&mdash;as Omerna carefully pointed out that he had predicted. There was
little chance the Borderlands would join the Children against the
false Dragon any time soon; lords in Shienar, Arafel and Kandor
were taking advantage of the Blight&rsquo;s quiet to rebel, and the
Queen of Saldaea had gone into seclusion in the country, in fear of
the same according to Omerna. His agents were at work, however, and
the Borderland rulers would be brought to heel as soon as these
small rebellions were quashed. On the other hand, the rulers of
Murandy, Altara and Ghealdan were ready to fall into line, though
making ambivalent noises at present to soothe the Tar Valon
witches. Alliandre of Ghealdan knew her throne was shaky, knew she
needed the Children to avoid plummeting as abruptly as her
predecessors, while both Tylin of Altara and Roedran of Murandy
hoped that the Children&rsquo;s weight would make them more than
figureheads at last. Plainly the man considered those lands already
as good as in Niall&rsquo;s coat pocket.</p>

<p>Within Amadicia, the picture was even better, by
Omerna&rsquo;s reckoning. Recruits flocked to the Children&rsquo;s
banners in greater numbers than for years. Strictly speaking, that
was none of Omerna&rsquo;s concern, but he always larded his reports
with any good news he could find. The Prophet would not trouble the
land much longer; at present his rabble squabbled over looting
villages and manors in the north, and might well scatter back into
Ghealdan at the next push by Ailron&rsquo;s soldiers. Little room
remained in the jails, because Darkfriends and Tar Valon spies were
being arrested faster than they could be hanged. The search for Tar
Valon witches had found only two so far, but over a hundred women
had been put to the question, an indication of how vigilant the
patrols were. And fewer refugees from Tarabon were being
apprehended, proof the quarantine was becoming more effective;
those caught were being thrown back into Tarabon as fast as they
could be taken back to the border. He hurried past that last,
unsurprising given his stupidity with the Illuminators.</p>

<p>Niall listened just enough to know where to nod.
Omerna had been an adequate commander in the field, so long as
someone told him what to do, but in his present position, his
credulous stupidity was trying. He had reported Morgase dead, her
corpse seen and identified beyond doubt, up to the very day Niall
brought him face-to-face with her. He had ridiculed &ldquo;rumors&rdquo; that
the Stone of Tear had fallen, and still denied that the mightiest
fortress in the world could have been taken by any outside force;
there had been treason, he insisted, a High Lord who had betrayed
the Stone to al&rsquo;Thor and Tar Valon. He maintained that the
disaster at Falme and the troubles in Tarabon and Arad Doman were
the work of Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s armies come back across the Aryth
Ocean. He was convinced that Siuan Sanche had not been deposed at
all, that al&rsquo;Thor was insane and dying, that Tar Valon had
murdered King Galldrian to deliberately set off the civil war in
Cairhien, and that these three &ldquo;facts&rdquo; were somehow tied into those
ridiculous rumors, always from somewhere conveniently far away, of
people bursting into flame or nightmares leaping out of thin air
and slaughtering whole villages. He was not sure how exactly, but
he was working on a grand theory he promised to deliver any day, a
theory that supposedly would unravel all the witches&rsquo; schemes
and deliver Tar Valon into Niall&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>That was the way with Omerna; he either invented
convoluted reasons for what happened, or else seized on gossip in
the streets and swallowed it whole. He spent a good deal of his
time listening to gossip, in manor houses <em>and</em> in the
streets. Not only had he been seen drinking in the taverns with
Hunters for the Horn, it was an ill-kept secret that he had laid
out huge sums for no fewer than three supposed Horns of Valere.
Each time he had carried the thing off to the country and puffed on
it for days, till even he had to admit that no dead heroes out of
legend were going to come riding back from the grave. Even so, the
failures were unlikely to stop him from future purchases in dark
alleys or the back rooms of taverns. The simple form of it was
this: where a spymaster should doubt his own face in the mirror,
Omerna believed anything.</p>

<p>Eventually the man ran down, and Niall said, &ldquo;I will
give your reports due consideration, Omerna. You have done well.&rdquo;
How the fellow preened, smoothing his tabard. &ldquo;Leave me, now. On
your way out, send Balwer in. I have some letters to dictate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, my Lord Captain Commander. Ah.&rdquo; In the
middle of his bow, Omerna frowned and fumbled in the pocket of his
white undercoat, pulling out a tiny bone cylinder that he handed to
Niall. &ldquo;This arrived at the pigeoncote this morning.&rdquo; Three thin
red stripes ran the length of the cylinder, meaning it was to be
brought to Niall with the wax seals intact. And the man had almost
forgotten it.</p>

<p>Omerna waited, no doubt hoping for a hint of what the
cylinder contained, but Niall waved him toward the door. &ldquo;Do not
forget Balwer. If Mattin Stepaneos might join me, I must write and
see if I can add a little weight to his making the right decision.&rdquo;
Omerna had no choice but to make his bow anew and go.</p>

<p>Even when the door closed behind the man, Niall only
fingered the cylinder. These rare special messages seldom brought
good news. Rising slowly&mdash;of late he sometimes felt age in
his bones&mdash;he filled a plain silver goblet with punch, but
then left it sitting on the table and flipped open a folder of
scroll-worked leather lined with linen. It contained a single sheet
of heavy paper, crumpled and partly torn, a street artist&rsquo;s
drawing in colored chalks of two men fighting in clouds, one with a
face made of fire, the other with dark reddish hair.
Al&rsquo;Thor.</p>

<p>All his plans to hinder the false Dragon had gone
awry, all his hopes to slow the man&rsquo;s tide of conquest, to
divert him. Had he waited too long, let al&rsquo;Thor grow too
powerful? If so, there was only one way to deal with him quickly,
the knife in the dark, the arrow from a rooftop. How long did he
dare wait? Did he dare risk not waiting? Too much haste could
spell disaster as surely as too long a delay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord sent for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Niall eyed the man who had entered so silently. On
the face of it, it hardly seemed possible that Balwer could move
without a dry rustle announcing his presence. Everything about him
was narrow and pinched; his brown coat hung from knobby shoulders,
and his legs looked as if they might snap under his desiccated
weight. He moved like a bird hopping from limb to limb. &ldquo;Do you
believe the Horn of Valere will call dead heroes back to save us,
Balwer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, my Lord,&rdquo; Balwer said, folding his hands
fussily. &ldquo;Perhaps not. I would not count on it, myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Niall nodded. &ldquo;And do you think Mattin Stepaneos will
join me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again, perhaps. He will not want to finish dead or a
puppet. His first and only concern is to hold on to the Laurel
Crown, and the army gathering in Tear must make him sweat for
that.&rdquo; Balwer smiled thinly, a bare compression of lips. &ldquo;He has
spoken openly about accepting my Lord&rsquo;s proposal, but on the
other hand I&rsquo;ve just learned he has been communicating with
the White Tower. Apparently he has agreed to something, though I
don&rsquo;t yet know what.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The world knew that Abdel Omerna was the
Children&rsquo;s spymaster. Such a position should have been secret,
of course, but stableboys and beggars pointed him out in the
street, warily, lest the most dangerous man in Amadicia see them.
The truth was that Omerna was a decoy, a fool who did not know
himself that he was only a mask hiding the true master of spies in
the Fortress of the Light, Sebban Balwer, Niall&rsquo;s prim
dried-up little secretary with his disapproving mouth. A man no
one would ever suspect, or credit if he was named to them.</p>

<p>Where Omerna believed everything, Balwer believed
nothing, perhaps not even in Darkfriends, or the Dark One. If
Balwer did believe in anything, it was looking over men&rsquo;s
shoulders, listening to their whispers, rooting out their secrets.
Of course, he would have served any master as well as he did Niall,
but that was all to the good. What Balwer learned was never tainted
by what he knew had to be true, or wanted to be true. Disbelieving
everything, he always managed to root out truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more than I expected out of Illian, Balwer, but
even he can be brought round.&rdquo; He would have to be. It could not be
too late. &ldquo;Is there any fresh word from the Borderlands?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet, my Lord. But Davram Bashere is in Caemlyn.
With thirty thousand light horse, my informants claim, but I think
no more than half that. He would not weaken Saldaea too far,
however quiet the Blight, even if Tenobia commanded him to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Niall grunted, the corner of his left eye trembling.
He fingered the sketch lying in its folder; supposedly it was a
fair likeness of al&rsquo;Thor. Bashere in Caemlyn; a good reason
for Tenobia to be hiding in the country from his envoy.</p>

<p>There was no good news from the Borderlands, whatever
Omerna thought. The &ldquo;minor rebellions&rdquo; Omerna reported were minor,
but not rebellions of the sort the man thought. Along the
Blightborder men were arguing over whether al&rsquo;Thor was another
false Dragon or the Dragon Reborn. Borderlanders being as they
were, sometimes those arguments flared into small-scale battles.
The fighting had begun in Shienar about the time the Stone of Tear
was falling, confirmation of the witches&rsquo; involvement if any
was needed. How it would all be settled was yet in doubt, according
to Balwer.</p>

<p>That al&rsquo;Thor remained confined to Caemlyn was
one of the few things Omerna had right. Yet why, with Bashere and
Aiel and the witches? Not even Balwer had been able to answer that.
Whatever the reason, the Light be praised for it! The
Prophet&rsquo;s mobs had settled in to loot the north of Amadicia,
true, but they were consolidating their hold, killing or putting to
flight any who refused to declare for the Prophet of the Dragon.
Ailron&rsquo;s soldiers had only stopped retreating because the
accursed Prophet had stopped advancing. Alliandre and the others
Omerna was certain would join him were in fact dithering, putting
off his ambassadors with flimsy excuses and delays. He suspected
they no more knew how they would leap than he did.</p>

<p>On the surface everything seemed to be going
al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s way at the moment, except for whatever held him
in Caemlyn, but Niall had always been at his most dangerous when he
was outnumbered and with his back to the wall.</p>

<p>If the rumors could be believed, Carridin was doing
well in Altara and Murandy, though not as quickly as Niall would
have liked. Time was as much an enemy as al&rsquo;Thor or the Tower.
Yet even if Carridin was only doing well in the rumors, that should
be enough. Perhaps it was time to extend the &ldquo;Dragonsworn&rdquo; into
Andor. Perhaps Illian, as well, though if the army gathering in
Tear was not enough to show Mattin Stepaneos the path, a few farms
and villages raided would hardly make a difference. The size of
that army horrified Niall; if it was half what Balwer reported, a
quarter, it still horrified him. Nothing like it had been seen
since Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s day. Rather than frighten men into
joining Niall, an army like that might intimidate them into falling
in behind the Dragon banner. Could he have found a year, just half
a year, he would have accounted it worth al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s whole
army of fools and villains and Aiel savages.</p>

<p>All was not lost, of course. All was never lost as
long as you were alive. Tarabon and Arad Doman were as useless to
al&rsquo;Thor and the witches as to him, two pits full of scorpions;
only a fool would put a hand in there until more of the scorpions
killed one another off. If Saldaea was lost, which he would not
concede, Shienar and Arafel and Kandor still hung in the balance,
and balances could be tipped. If Mattin Stepaneos wanted to ride
two horses at once&mdash;he had always liked to try that&mdash;he
could yet be forced to choose the right one. Altara and Murandy
would be prodded to the proper side, and Andor would drop into his
hand whether or not he decided a touch of Carridin&rsquo;s whip was
required. In Tear, Balwer&rsquo;s agents had convinced Tedosian and
Estanda to join Darlin, turning a show of defiance into real
rebellion, and the man was confident the same could be done in
Cairhien, and in Andor. Another month, two at the outside, and
Eamon Valda would arrive from Tar Valon; Niall could have done
without Valda, but then the great majority of the Children&rsquo;s
strength would be in one spot, ready to use where it could do the
most good.</p>

<p>Yes, he had a good deal on his side yet. Nothing had
solidified, but everything coalesced. Time was all that was
needed.</p>

<p>Realizing he still held the bone cylinder, he cracked
the wax seal with a thumbnail and carefully drew out the thin paper
rolled up inside.</p>

<p>Balwer said nothing, but his mouth compressed again,
not in a smile this time. Omerna he put up with, knowing the man a
fool, much preferring to remain hidden himself, but he did not like
Niall receiving reports that bypassed him, from men he did not
know.</p>

<p>A tiny, spidery scrawl covered the slip in a cipher
that few besides Niall knew, none of them in Amador. For him,
reading it was as easy as reading his own hand. The sign at the
bottom made him blink, and so did the contents. Varadin was, or had
been, one of the best of his personal agents, a rug seller who did
good service during the Troubles while peddling his wares through
Altara, Murandy and Illian. What he earned there had set him up as
a wealthy merchant in Tanchico, regularly supplying fine carpets
and wines to the palaces of King and Panarch, as well as to most of
the nobles of their courts, and always leaving with his eyes and
ears full. Niall had thought him long since dead in the upheaval
there; this was the first word from him in a year. From what
Varadin wrote, it would have been better if he truly had been a
year dead. In the jerky hand of a man on the brink of madness, it
was a wild disjointed ramble about men riding strange beasts and
flying creatures, Aes Sedai on leashes and the <em>Hailene</em>.
That meant Forerunners in the Old Tongue, but there was not even an
attempt to explain why Varadin was terrified of them or who they
were supposed to be. Plainly the man had taken a brain fever from
watching his country disintegrate around him.</p>

<p>Annoyed, Niall crumpled the paper and threw it aside.
 &ldquo;First I must sit through Omerna&rsquo;s idiocy and now this. What
else do you have for me, Balwer?&rdquo; Bashere. Matters could become
nasty with Bashere to general al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s armies. The man
had earned his reputation. A dagger in the shadows for him?</p>

<p>Balwer&rsquo;s eyes never left Niall&rsquo;s face by so
much as a flicker, but Niall knew the tiny ball of paper on the
floor would end up in the man&rsquo;s hands unless he burned it.
 &ldquo;Four things that might be of interest, my Lord. The least first.
The rumors about meetings between the Ogier <em>stedding</em> are
true. For Ogier, they seem to be showing some haste.&rdquo; He did not
say what the meetings were about, of course; getting a human into
an Ogier Stump was as impossible as getting an Ogier to spy. Easier
to have the sun rise at night. &ldquo;Also, there are an unusual number
of Sea Folk ships in the southern ports, not taking cargo, not
sailing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are they waiting for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Balwer&rsquo;s mouth tightened as though
drawstrings had been pulled shut. &ldquo;I do not know yet, my Lord.&rdquo;
Balwer never liked admitting there were any human secrets he could
not ferret out. Trying to learn more than the surface of what went
on among the Atha&rsquo;an Miere was like trying to learn how the
Guild of Illuminators made fireworks, an exercise in futility. At
least the Ogier might eventually make known the decisions of their
meetings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Continue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The news of middling interest is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;peculiar, my
Lord. Al&rsquo;Thor has reliably been reported in Caemlyn, in Tear
and in Cairhien, sometimes on the same day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reliably? Reliable madness. The witches probably
have two or three men who look like al&rsquo;Thor, enough to fool
anyone who doesn&rsquo;t know him. That would explain a good
deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, my Lord. My informants <em>are</em>
reliable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Niall slapped the leather folder closed, hiding
al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;And the news of greatest interest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have it from two sources in Altara&mdash;reliable
sources, my Lord&mdash;that the witches in Salidar claim the Red
Ajah encouraged Logain to become a false Dragon. All but created
him, in fact. They have Logain in Salidar&mdash;or a man they say
is Logain&mdash;and are showing him to nobles they bring there. I
have no proof, but I suspect they are telling the same tale to any
ruler they can reach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frowning, Niall studied the banners overhead. Those
represented enemies from nearly every land; no one had ever
defeated him twice, and few once. The banners were all faded with
age, now. Like him. Yet he was not too faded to see an end to what
he had begun. Every banner taken in bloody battle, where you never
really knew what was happening beyond sight of your own eyes, where
certain victory and certain defeat could be equally ephemeral. The
worst battle he had ever fought, armies blundering into one another
in the night near Moisen, during the Troubles, had been clear as a
bright summer&rsquo;s day compared to the one he fought now.</p>

<p>Could he have been wrong? Could the Tower really be
broken? A struggle of some sort between the Ajahs? Over what?
Al&rsquo;Thor? If the witches were fighting among themselves, there
would be many in the Children ready to advocate Carridin&rsquo;s
solution, a strike to destroy Salidar and as many of the witches as
possible. Men who believed thinking of tomorrow was thinking ahead
but never considered next week or next month, let alone next year.
Valda, for one; perhaps it was just as well he had not reached
Amador yet. For another, Rhadam Asunawa, the High Inquisitor of the
Questioners. Valda always wanted to use an axe even when a poniard
was best for the task at hand. Asunawa just wanted every woman who
had ever spent a night in the Tower hanged as of yesterday, every
book that mentioned Aes Sedai or the One Power burned, and the
words themselves banned. Asunawa never had a thought beyond those
goals, nor a care for costs. Niall had worked too hard, risked too
much, to allow this to become a struggle between the Children and
the Tower in the eyes of the world.</p>

<p>In truth, it did not matter whether he was wrong. If
he was, it still could be very much to his advantage. Perhaps more
than if he was right. With a little luck, he could shatter the
White Tower past repairing, splinter the witches into shards easily
ground to dust. Al&rsquo;Thor would surely falter then, while
remaining enough of a threat to be used as a goad. And he could
hold closely to the truth. Fairly closely.</p>

<p>Without taking his eyes from the banners, he said,
 &ldquo;The split in the Tower is real. The Black Ajah rose up, the
victors hold the Tower and the losers were driven out to lick their
wounds in Salidar.&rdquo; He looked at Balwer, and nearly smiled. One of
the Children would have been protesting that there was no Black
Ajah, or rather that all the witches were Darkfriends; the newest
recruit would have. Balwer merely looked at him, not at all as if
he had just blasphemed against all the Children stood for. &ldquo;The
only decision to make is whether the Black Ajah won or lost. I
think they won. Most people will think of whoever holds the Tower
as the real Aes Sedai. Let them associate <em>real</em> Aes Sedai
with Black Ajah. Al&rsquo;Thor is a creature of the Tower, a vassal
of the Black Ajah.&rdquo; Lifting his winecup from the table, he took a
sip; it did not help the heat. &ldquo;Perhaps I can fit it in with why I
haven&rsquo;t moved against Salidar yet.&rdquo; Through his emissaries, he
had been using the failure to move as proof of how dire he saw the
threat from al&rsquo;Thor; he was willing to let the witches
congregate on Amadicia&rsquo;s doorstep rather than be diverted from
the danger of the false Dragon. &ldquo;The women there, appalled after
all these years at how pervasive the Black Ajah is, repelled at
last by the evil they&rsquo;ve been immersed in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His
inventiveness ran out&mdash;they were all servants of the Dark
One; what evil could repel them?&mdash;but after a moment Balwer
took it up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they&rsquo;ve decided to throw themselves on
my Lord&rsquo;s mercy, even ask my Lord&rsquo;s protection. Losers in
a rebellion, weaker than their enemies, fearing to be crushed; a
man falling off a cliff to certain death will stretch out a hand
even to his worst enemy. Perhaps&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Balwer tapped bony fingers
against his lips in thought. &ldquo;Perhaps they are ready to repent
their sins and renounce being Aes Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Niall stared at him. He suspected the Tar Valon
witches&rsquo; sins were among the things Balwer did not believe in.
 &ldquo;That is absurd,&rdquo; he said flatly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the sort of thing I
might expect from Omerna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His secretary&rsquo;s face remained as prim as ever,
but he began dry-washing his hands the way he did when he felt
insulted. &ldquo;What my Lord might expect to hear from him, but just the
sort of thing that will be repeated where he does most of his
listening, in the streets and where nobles gossip over wine.
Absurdities are never laughed at there; only listened to. What is
too absurd to believe is believed because it is too absurd to be a
lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How would you present it? I will start no rumor of
the Children dealing with witches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would only be rumor, my Lord.&rdquo; Niall&rsquo;s gaze
hardened, and Balwer spread his hands. &ldquo;As my Lord wishes. Each
retelling always adds embellishment, so a simple tale has the best
chance of the core surviving. I suggest four rumors, my lord, not
one. The first, that the division in the Tower was caused by a
Black Ajah uprising. The second, that the Black Ajah won, and
control the Tower. Third, the Aes Sedai in Salidar, repelled and
horrified, are renouncing being Aes Sedai. And fourth, they have
approached you, seeking mercy and protection. For most people, each
will be a confirmation of the others.&rdquo; Tugging on his lapels,
Balwer gave a narrow self-satisfied smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, Balwer. Let it be so.&rdquo; Niall took a
deeper drink of wine. The heat was making him feel his age. His
bones seemed brittle. But he would last long enough to see the
false Dragon put down and the world united to face Tarmon
Gai&rsquo;don. Even if he did not live to lead in the Last
Battle, the Light would surely grant him that much. &ldquo;And I want
Elayne Trakand and her brother Gawyn found, Balwer, and brought to
Amador. See to it. You may leave me now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead of going, Balwer hesitated. &ldquo;My Lord knows I
never suggest any course of action.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you mean to suggest one now? What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Press Morgase, my Lord. More than a month has
passed, and she still <em>considers</em> my Lord&rsquo;s proposal.
She&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough, Balwer.&rdquo; Niall sighed. Sometimes he wished
Balwer were not an Amadician, but a Cairhienin who had taken in the
Game of Houses with his mother&rsquo;s milk. &ldquo;Morgase is more
committed to me every day, whatever she believes. I would like it
better had she accepted immediately&mdash;I could have Andor
raised against al&rsquo;Thor today, with a thick leavening of
Children to stiffen it&mdash;but every day that she remains my
guest ties her to me more tightly. Eventually she will discover she
is allied to me because the world believes she is, tangled so
tightly she can never escape: And no one will ever be able to say I
coerced her, Balwer. That is important. It is always harder to
abandon an alliance the world thinks you entered freely than one
you can prove you were forced into. Reckless haste leads to ruin,
Balwer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As my Lord says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Niall gestured a dismissal, and the man bowed his way
out. Balwer did not understand. Morgase was a rugged opponent.
Pressed too hard, she would turn and fight whatever the odds. Yet
pressed just hard enough, she would fight the enemy she thought she
saw and never see the trap building around her until it was too
late. Time pressed down on him, all the years he had lived, all the
months he desperately needed, but he would not let haste ruin his
plans.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The stooping falcon struck the large duck in an
explosion of feathers, and the two birds separated, the duck
tumbling toward the ground. Banking sharply in the cloudless sky,
the falcon swooped back onto her falling prey, clutched it in her
talons. The weight of the duck burdened her, but she struggled back
toward the people waiting below.</p>

<p>Morgase wondered whether she was like the falcon, too
proud and too determined to realize when she had latched on to a
prize too heavy for her wings to support. She tried to make her
gloved hands loosen their grip on her reins. Her wide-brimmed white
hat, with its long white plumes, provided a little protection from
the unrelenting sun, but sweat beaded on her face. In a riding
dress of green silk embroidered in gold, she did not look a
prisoner.</p>

<p>Figures mounted and afoot filled the long pasture of
dried brown grass, though they did not crowd it. A cluster of
musicians in white-embroidered blue tabards, with flutes and
bitterns and tambours, produced a light tune suitable for an
afternoon over chilled wine. A dozen handlers in long, elaborately
worked leather vests over billowing white shirts stroked hooded
falcons perched on their gauntleted arms, or puffed short pipes and
blew streams of blue smoke at their birds. Twice as many brightly
liveried servants moved about with fruits and wine in golden
goblets on golden trays, and a band of men clad in bright mail
encircled the pasture just short of the largely bare-branched
trees. All in aid of Morgase and her retinue, to insure their
hawking went safely.</p>

<p>Well, that was the reason given, though the
Prophet&rsquo;s people were a good two hundred miles north and
brigands seemed unlikely this close to Amador. And despite the
women clustered around her on their mares and geldings, in bright
silk riding dresses and wide-brimmed hats resplendent with colored
plumes, their hair in the long ringlets currently in fashion in the
Amadician court, Morgase&rsquo;s retinue in truth consisted of Basel
Gill, awkward on his horse off to one side, with his jerkin of
metal discs straining around his girth over the red silk coat she
had procured him so he would not be outshone by the servants, and
Paitr Conel, even more awkward in a page&rsquo;s red-and-white coat
and displaying the nervousness he had shown since she added him to
her party. The women were nobles from Ailron&rsquo;s court,
 &ldquo;volunteers&rdquo; to be Morgase&rsquo;s ladies-in-waiting. Poor Master
Gill fingered his sword and eyed the Whitecloak guards
disconsolately. That was what they were, though, as usual when
escorting her out of the Fortress of Light, not wearing their white
cloaks. And they were guards. If she tried to ride too far or
remain out too long, their commander, a hard-eyed young man named
Norowhin who hated pretending to be other than a Whitecloak, would
 &ldquo;suggest&rdquo; that she return to Amador because the heat was growing
too great, or because of a sudden rumor of bandits in the area.
There was no arguing with fifty armored men, not with any dignity.
Norowhin had come within a hair of taking her reins from her the
first time. That was the reason she never let Tallanvor accompany
her on these rides. That young fool might insist on her honor
and rights if there were a hundred men against him. He spent his
spare hours practicing the sword as though he expected to carve a
way to freedom for her.</p>

<p>Startlingly a sudden breeze brushed her face, and she
realized that Laurain had leaned from her saddle to fan her with a
white lace fan. A slender young woman with dark eyes set slightly
too close together, Laurain wore a permanent simper. &ldquo;It must be so
gratifying for Your Majesty to learn that her son has joined the
Children of the Light. And to have attained rank so quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That should be no surprise,&rdquo; Altalin said, fanning
her own plump face. &ldquo;Her Majesty&rsquo;s son would of course rise
quickly, as the sun in splendor does.&rdquo; She basked in the
appreciative murmurs from some of the other women for her pitiful
pun.</p>

<p>Morgase kept her face smooth with difficulty.
Niall&rsquo;s news last evening, during one of his surprise visits,
had come as a shock. Galad a Whitecloak! At least he was safe, so
Niall said. But unable to visit her; the duties of a Child of the
Light kept him away. But assuredly he would be part of her escort
when she returned to Andor at the head of an army of the
Children.</p>

<p>No, Galad was no more safe than Elayne or Gawyn.
Perhaps less. The Light send that Elayne was secure in the White
Tower. The Light send that Gawyn was alive; Niall claimed not to
know where he was, except that he was not in Tar Valon. Galad was a
knife to her throat. Niall would never be so crude as to even
suggest it, but one simple order from him could send Galad where he
would surely die. The one protection he had was that Niall might
think she did not care as much for him as for Elayne and Gawyn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am pleased for him if it is what he seeks,&rdquo; she
told them in an indifferent tone. &ldquo;But he is Taringail&rsquo;s son,
not mine. Taringail was a marriage of state, you understand.
Strange, but he has been dead so long, I can hardly recall his
face. Galad is free to do as he will. It is Gawyn who will be First
Prince of the Sword when Elayne follows me on the Lion Throne.&rdquo; She
waved away a servant with a goblet on a tray. &ldquo;Niall could at least
have provided us with decent wine.&rdquo; A wave of anxious titters
answered her. She had had some success in drawing them closer to
her, yet none could be easy about offending Pedron Niall, not where
it might get back to him. Morgase took every opportunity to do so
in their hearing. It convinced them of her bravery, important if
she was to gain even partial allegiance. Perhaps more importantly,
for her own mind at least, it helped maintain the illusion that she
was not Niall&rsquo;s prisoner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear that Rand al&rsquo;Thor displays the Lion
Throne like a trophy from the hunt.&rdquo; That was Marande, a pretty
woman with a heart-shaped face, somewhat older than the others. The
sister of the High Seat of House Algoran, she was powerful in her
own right, perhaps powerful enough to have resisted Ailron, but not
Niall. The others reined their mounts aside for her to heel her bay
gelding closer to Morgase. There was no question of gaining any
sort of allegiance or friendship from Marande.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard as much,&rdquo; Morgase replied blithely.
 &ldquo;The lion is a dangerous animal to hunt, and the Lion Throne more
so. Especially for a man. It always kills men who seek it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marande smiled. &ldquo;I also hear he gives high places to
men who can channel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That produced uneasy glances among the other women,
and a worried buzz. One of the younger women, Marewin, slight and
little more than a girl, swayed in her high-cantled saddle as if
she might faint. News of al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s amnesty had spawned
frightening tales; rumors only, Morgase fervently hoped. The Light
send it was all rumor, men who could channel gathering in Caemlyn,
carousing in the Royal Palace, terrorizing the city.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hear a great deal,&rdquo; Morgase said. &ldquo;Do you spend
all your time listening at cracked doors?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marande&rsquo;s smile deepened. She had been unable to
resist pressure to become one of Morgase&rsquo;s attendants, but she
was powerful enough to show her displeasure without fear. She was
like a thorn driven deep into the foot, impossible to dislodge and
giving a sharp jab at every step. &ldquo;I have little time left from the
pleasure of serving Your Majesty to listen anywhere, but I do try
to catch what news I can of Andor. So I may converse with Your
Majesty. I hear the false Dragon consorts daily with Andoran
nobles. Lady Arymilla and Lady Naean, Lord Jarin and Lord Lir.
Others, friends of theirs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the falconers lifted a hooded, sleek gray bird
with black wings up to Morgase. Silver bells on the falcon&rsquo;s
jesses tinkled as she shifted on the handler&rsquo;s gauntlet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, but I have had enough of hawking for
today,&rdquo; Morgase told him, then raised her voice. &ldquo;Master Gill,
gather the escort. I am returning to the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gill gave a start. He knew very well that all he was
there for was to ride at her heels, but he began waving and
shouting orders to the Whitecloaks as if he believed they would
obey. For her part, Morgase turned her black mare immediately. She
did not take the animal faster than a walk, of course. Norowhin
would have been on her like a flash if he saw a possibility she was
considering escape.</p>

<p>As it was, the cloakless Whitecloaks were galloping
to form up their escort before the mare had gone ten steps, and
before she reached the edge of the meadow, Norowhin was at her
side, a dozen men ahead and the rest close behind. The servants and
musicians and falconers were left to gather themselves up and
follow as quickly as they could.</p>

<p>Gill and Paitr took their places behind her, and then
came the ladies-in-waiting. Marande wore her smile like a badge of
triumph now, though some of the others frowned in disapproval. Not
too openly&mdash;even if she had had to yield to Niall, the woman
was a force to be reckoned with in Amadicia&mdash;but most of them
did try to do their best at a task they did not want. For the
greater part they would likely have attended Morgase willingly; it
was residing inside the Fortress of the Light they did not
like.</p>

<p>Morgase would have smiled herself if she could be
sure Marande would not see it. The only reason she had not insisted
weeks ago that the woman be sent away was how free she was with her
tongue. Marande enjoyed pricking her with how far Andor had fallen
from her grasp, but the names she chose were a balm to Morgase. All
men and women who had opposed her during the Succession, all
sycophants of Gaebril. She expected no less of them, and no more.
Had Marande named others, the result would have been different.
Lord Pelivar or Abelle or Luan, Lady Arathelle or Ellorien or
Aemlyn. Others. They had never been part of Marande&rsquo;s stabs,
and they would have been if even a whisper from Andor had made her
think of them. So long as Marande did not mention them, there was
at least hope that they had not knelt to al&rsquo;Thor. They had
supported Morgase&rsquo;s first claim to the throne, and they might
yet again, the Light willing.</p>

<p>Nearly leafless forest gave way to a road of
hard-packed dirt, and they took it south toward Amador. Stretches
of woods alternated with coppiced trees and fallow stone-fenced
fields, with thatch-roofed stone houses and barns standing well
back from the road. A good many people crowded the way, raising
dust that made Morgase tie a silk kerchief across her face, though
they scrambled aside onto the verge at the first glimpse of such a
large party of armed and armored men. Some even darted into the
trees or leaped fences and scurried across the fields. The
Whitecloaks ignored them, and no farmers appeared to shake a fist
or shout at the trespassers. Several of the farms had an abandoned
look, with no chickens or animals in sight.</p>

<p>Among the people on the road there was an ox-cart
here, a man with a few sheep there, somewhere else a young woman
herding a flock of geese. Plainly they were all local people. Some
had a bundle shouldered or a fat scrip, but most were empty-handed,
walking as if with no idea where they were going. The numbers of
the latter sort had increased every time Morgase had been allowed
to leave Amador, no matter in which direction.</p>

<p>Adjusting the kerchief over her nose, Morgase eyed
Norowhin sideways. He was about Tallanvor&rsquo;s age and height,
but there the resemblance ended. Red-faced under his burnished
conical helmet and peeling from the sun, he had never been
handsome. A lanky build and a thrusting nose made her think of a
pickaxe. Every time she left the Fortress of the Light, he led her
 &ldquo;escort,&rdquo; and every time she tried to engage him in conversation.
Whitecloak or not, every inch she could shift him from being her
jailer was a victory. &ldquo;Are these people refugees from the Prophet,
Norowhin?&rdquo; They could not all be; as many were heading north as
south.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said curtly, without even glancing at her.
His eyes scanned the roadsides as if he expected a rescue to appear
for her any moment.</p>

<p>That, unfortunately, was the sort of response she had
had so far, but she persevered. &ldquo;Who are they, then? Not
Taraboners, surely. You do a very good job of moving them on.&rdquo; She
had seen a party of Taraboners, fifty or so men, women and
children, dirty and half falling with weariness, being herded west
like cattle by mounted Whitecloaks. Only the bitter knowledge that
she could do absolutely nothing had enabled her to hold her tongue.
 &ldquo;Amadicia is a rich land. Even this drought cannot have driven so
many from their farms in just a few months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Norowhin&rsquo;s face worked. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said finally.
 &ldquo;They are refugees from the false Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how? He is hundreds of leagues from
Amadicia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again a struggle was plain on the man&rsquo;s
sunburned face, either for words or against speaking. &ldquo;They believe
he is the true Dragon Reborn,&rdquo; he said at last, sounding disgusted.
 &ldquo;They say he has broken all bonds, according to the Prophecies. Men
forsake their lords, apprentices desert their masters. Husbands
abandon their families, and wives their husbands. It is a plague
carried on the wind, a wind that blows from the false Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morgase&rsquo;s eyes fell on a young man and woman
huddled in each other&rsquo;s arms, watching her party pass. Sweat
streaked the dirt on their faces, and dust coated their plain
clothes. They looked hungry, their cheeks sunken, their eyes too
big. Could this be happening in Andor? Had Rand al&rsquo;Thor done
this to Andor too? <em>If he has, he will pay</em>. The problem was
making sure the cure was not worse than the disease. To deliver
Andor, even from this, and hand it to the Whitecloaks&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She tried to keep the conversation going, but having
delivered himself of more words than he had ever before spoken to
her at one time, Norowhin retreated into monosyllables. It did not
matter; if she could crack his reserve once, she could again.</p>

<p>Twisting in her saddle, she tried to see the young
man and woman, but they were hidden behind the Whitecloak soldiers.
That did not matter either. Those faces would reside in her memory,
alongside her promise.</p>
