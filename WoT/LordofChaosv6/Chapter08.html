<h4><em>The Storm Gathers</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ynaeve
woke the next morning at first light feeling
grumpy. She had a sense of bad weather coming, yet a glance out of
the window revealed not a single cloud marring the still gray sky.
Already the day promised to be another oven. Her shift was
sweat-damp and twisted from tossing and turning. Once she had been
able to rely on her ability to Listen to the Wind, but it seemed to
have gone all askew since leaving the Two Rivers, when it did not
desert her completely.</p>

<p>Waiting her turn to use the washstand did not help,
either, nor listening to Elayne&rsquo;s recital of what had happened
after she left them in Elaida&rsquo;s study. Her own night had been
one long futile search through the streets of Tar Valon, empty save
for herself, pigeons, rats and heaps of garbage. That had
been a shock. Tar Valon was always kept spotless; Elaida must
be neglecting the city terribly for garbage to show in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. Once she had glimpsed Leane through
the window of a tavern near Southharbor, of all places, but when
she hurried inside, the common room was empty except for the
freshly painted blue tables and benches. She should just have given
up, but Myrelle had been badgering her lately, and she wanted a
clear conscience when she told the woman that she had tried.
Myrelle could pounce on an evasion as quickly as anyone Nynaeve had
ever seen or heard of. To finish it off, she had stepped out of
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> last night to find Elayne&rsquo;s
ring already back on the table and Elayne fast asleep. If there had
been a prize for useless effort, she would have won it walking
away. And now to learn that Sheriam and the rest had nearly gotten
themselves killed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;even the song sparrow&rsquo;s chirping in
its wicker cage earned a sour look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They think they know everything,&rdquo; Nynaeve muttered
disparagingly. &ldquo;I told them about nightmares. I warned them, and
last night was not the first time.&rdquo; It made no difference that all
six sisters had been Healed before she so much as got back from
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. Much too easily it could have
ended much worse&mdash;because they thought they knew it all. The
irritated tugs she gave her braid delayed redoing it for the day.
The <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> bracelet sometimes caught on her hair, too,
but she was not about to take it off. It was Elayne&rsquo;s turn to
wear it today, but she was just as likely to leave it on a peg on
the wall. Worry tickled through the bracelet, and the inevitable
fear, but more than anything else, frustration. Doubtless &ldquo;Marigan&rdquo;
was already helping with breakfast; having to do chores seemed to
grate at her more than being a prisoner did. &ldquo;That was good
thinking on your part, Elayne. You didn&rsquo;t say how you ended up
in it yourself after trying to warn everybody else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still scrubbing with her facecloth, Elayne shuddered.
 &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t so hard to think of it. A nightmare that size
needed all of us to handle. Maybe they learned a little humility.
Maybe their meeting with the Wise Ones tonight won&rsquo;t be so
bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve nodded to herself. As she had thought. Not
about Sheriam and the others; Aes Sedai would find humility when
goats flew on wings, and a day before the Wise Ones at that. About
Elayne. She had probably let herself be caught in the nightmare,
though the girl would never admit it. Nynaeve was not sure whether
Elayne thought taking credit for bravery was boasting or whether
she simply did not realize how brave she was. Either way, Nynaeve
was torn between admiration for the other woman&rsquo;s courage and
a wish that just once Elayne would acknowledge it. &ldquo;I thought I saw
Rand.&rdquo; That brought the facecloth down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he there in the flesh?&rdquo; That was dangerous,
according to the Wise Ones; it risked losing some part of what made
you human. &ldquo;You warned him about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did he start listening to sense? I only
glimpsed him. Maybe he just touched <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> in a dream.&rdquo; Unlikely, that. He
apparently hedged his dreams with wards so strong she did not think
he could reach the World of Dreams any other way than in the flesh,
not even if he had been a Dreamwalker <em>and</em> had one of the
rings. &ldquo;Maybe it was somebody who looked a little like him. As I
said, I only saw him for a moment, in the square in front of the
Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be there with him,&rdquo; Elayne muttered.
Emptying the basin into the night jar, she moved aside to let
Nynaeve reach the washstand. &ldquo;He <em>needs</em> me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What he needs is what he has always needed.&rdquo; Nynaeve
glowered as she refilled the basin from the pitcher. She did hate
washing in water that had stood all night. At least it was not
cold; there was no such thing as cold water anymore. &ldquo;Somebody to
box his ears once a week on general principles and keep him on the
straight and narrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t fair.&rdquo; A clean shift going over
Elayne&rsquo;s head muffled the words. &ldquo;I worry about him all the
time.&rdquo; Her face popped out the top, looking more worried than
indignant whatever her tone, and she pulled a banded white dress
from one of the pegs. &ldquo;I even worry about him in my <em>
dreams</em>! Do you think he spends all his time fretting about
<em>me</em>? I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve nodded, though a part of her considered that
it was not exactly the same. Rand had been told Elayne was safe
with Aes Sedai, if not where. How could Rand ever be safe? She bent
over the basin, and Lan&rsquo;s ring fell out of her shift, dangling
on its leather cord. No, Elayne was right. Whatever Lan was doing,
wherever he was, she doubted he thought of her half as often as she
did of him. <em>Light, let him be alive even if he doesn&rsquo;t
think of me at all</em>. That possibility made her angry enough to
pull her braid out by the roots, if she had not had her hands full
of soap and facecloth. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t concern yourself over a man
all the time,&rdquo; she said sourly, &ldquo;even if you do want to be a Green.
What did they find out last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a long tale, though with little meat to it,
and after a bit Nynaeve sat down on Elayne&rsquo;s bed to listen and
ask questions. Not that the answers told her much either. It was
just not the same when you did not see the documents yourself. All
very well to learn Elaida finally knew about Rand&rsquo;s amnesty,
but what did she mean to do about it? Proof the Tower was
approaching rulers might actually be good news; it might light a
fire under the Hall. Something had to. Elaida sending an embassy to
Rand was certainly a worry, but he could not be fool enough to
listen to anyone who came from Elaida. Could he? There just was not
enough in what Elayne had overheard. And what was Rand doing
putting the Lion Throne on a pedestal? What was he doing with a
throne at all? He might be the Dragon Reborn and this Aiel <em>
car</em>-whatever, but she could not get past the fact that she had
tended him when he was a child and paddled his bottom when he
needed it.</p>

<p>Elayne went right ahead dressing, and was done before
her story was. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you the rest later,&rdquo; she said
hastily, and flew out the door.</p>

<p>Nynaeve grunted and went back to clothing herself
unhurriedly. Elayne was teaching her first class of novices today,
something Nynaeve had not been allowed to do yet. But if she was
not trusted to teach novices, there was still Moghedien. She would
be done with her breakfast chores shortly.</p>

<p>The only trouble was, when Nynaeve found the woman,
Moghedien was up to her elbows in soapy water, the silver necklace
of the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> looking especially out of place. She was
not alone; a dozen other women were industriously scrubbing clothes
on washboards in a wooden-fenced yard, amid steaming kettles of
boiling water. More were hanging the first wash on long lines
strung between poles, but heaps of bed linens and smallclothes and
every sort of thing waited their turn on the washboards. The look
Moghedien gave Nynaeve should have been enough to fry her hide.
Hatred, shame and outrage rolled through the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>,
nearly enough to swamp the ever-present fear.</p>

<p>The woman in charge, a sticklike gray-haired woman
named Nildra, came bustling up, a stirring paddle held like a
scepter and her dark woolen skirts tied up to the knee to keep them
off ground muddy from spilled water. &ldquo;Good morning, Accepted. I
suppose you want Marigan, eh?&rdquo; Her tone was a dry blend of respect
with knowledge that tomorrow she might find any one of the Accepted
added to her laundresses for a day or a month, to be worked and
chivvied as hard as the rest if not harder. &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t let
her go, yet. I&rsquo;m shorthanded as it is. One of my girls is
getting married today, another ran off, and two are on light work
because they&rsquo;re pregnant. Myrelle Sedai told me I could have
her. Maybe I can do without her in a few hours. I&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moghedien straightened, opening her mouth, but
Nynaeve silenced her with a firm look&mdash;and a conspicuous
touch to the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> bracelet on her wrist&mdash;and
she resumed work. All it would take would be a few wrong words from
Moghedien, a complaint that would never come from the farm woman
she appeared to be, to start her on a path to stilling and the
headsman, and Nynaeve and Elayne on one not much better. Nynaeve
could not help swallowing in relief when Moghedien bent back to her
washboard, mouth working as she muttered under her breath. Immense
shame and outright fury surged through the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>.</p>

<p>Nynaeve managed a smile for Nildra and murmured
something, she was not sure what, then stalked off to one of the
communal kitchens to find breakfast. Myrelle again. She wondered
if the Green had taken against her personally for some reason. She
wondered if she was going to harvest a permanently sour stomach
from keeping Moghedien. She was practically eating goosemint like
candy since putting the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> on the woman.</p>

<p>It was easy enough to get a clay mug full of tea with
honey and a bun hot from the oven, but once she had them, she
walked while she ate. Sweat beaded on her face. Even at that early
hour heat was building and the air dry. The rising sun formed a
dome of molten gold above the forest.</p>

<p>The dirt streets were full, as usual when there was
light to see. Aes Sedai glided past serenely, ignoring dust and
heat, mysterious-faced on mysterious errands, often with Warders
heeling them, cold-eyed wolves vainly pretending to be tame. There
were soldiers everywhere, usually marching or riding in blocks,
though Nynaeve did not understand why they were allowed to crowd
the streets so when they had camps in the woods. Children darted
about, often aping the soldiers with sticks for swords and pikes.
White-clad novices trotted through the throng about their chores.
Servants moved somewhat more slowly, women with armloads of sheets
for Aes Sedais&rsquo; beds or baskets of bread from the kitchens,
men leading ox-carts piled with firewood, hauling chests or
shouldering whole sheep carcasses for the kitchens. Salidar had not
been made to hold so many people; the village was ready to pop at
the seams.</p>

<p>Nynaeve kept moving. An Accepted&rsquo;s day was
supposedly her own for the most part, unless she was teaching
novices, to be used studying what she chose to, alone or with an
Aes Sedai, but an Accepted who appeared to be doing nothing could
be snapped up by any Aes Sedai. She did not intend to spend the day
helping a Brown sister catalog books or copying out notes for a
Gray. She <em>hated</em> copying, with all that tongue clicking if
she made a blot and all those sighs because her script was not as
neat as a clerk&rsquo;s. So she wove through the dust and the crowd,
and kept an eye out for Siuan and Leane. She was angry enough to
channel without using Moghedien.</p>

<p>Every time she became aware of the heavy gold ring
nestling between her breasts she thought, <em>He has to be alive.
Even if he&rsquo;s forgotten me, Light, just let him be alive</em>.
Which last, of course, only made her angrier. If al&rsquo;Lan
Mandragoran so much as let forgetting her cross his mind, she would
set him straight. He had to be alive. Warders often died avenging
their Aes Sedai&mdash;it was as sure as the sun coming up that no
Warder would let anything stand in the way of that retribution&mdash;but there was no way for Lan to avenge Moiraine any more
than if she had fallen off a horse and broken her neck. She and
Lanfear had killed one another. He had to be alive. And why should
she feel guilty over Moiraine&rsquo;s death? True, it had freed Lan
for her, but she had had nothing to do with it. Yet her first
thought on learning Moiraine was dead, however momentary, had been
joy that Lan was free, not sorrow for Moiraine. She could not rid
herself of shame over that, and it made her angrier than ever.</p>

<p>Suddenly she saw Myrelle stalking down the street in
her direction with yellow-haired Croi Makin, one of her three
Warders, striding at her side, a young splinter of a man but hard
as rock. A determined look on her face, the Aes Sedai certainly
showed no effects from the night before. There was nothing to say
Myrelle was looking for her, but Nynaeve quickly ducked into a
large stone building that had once been one of Salidar&rsquo;s three
inns.</p>

<p>The broad common room had been cleared and furnished
like a reception room; its plaster walls and high ceiling had been
patched, a few bright tapestries had been hung, and a few colorful
rugs lay scattered on a floor that no longer looked precisely
splintered but still did not want to hold a polish. The shaded
interior actually seemed cool after the street: Cooler, at least.
It was also in use.</p>

<p>Logain stood insolently in front of one of the wide
unlit fireplaces, the tails of his gold-embroidered red coat shoved
behind his back, under the watchful gaze of Lelaine Akashi, her
blue-fringed shawl marking the occasion as formal. A slender woman
with a dignified air that could sometimes break in a warm smile,
she was one of the three Sitters for the Blue Ajah in the Hall
of the Tower in Salidar. Today it was her penetrating eye
most in evidence as she studied Logain&rsquo;s audience.</p>

<p>Two men and a woman resplendent in embroidered silks
and gold jewelry, all three graying, and one of the men nearly bald
and wearing a square-cut beard and long mustache to make up for it.
Powerful Altaran nobles, they had arrived the day before with
strong escorts and as much suspicion for one another as for the Aes
Sedai gathering an army inside Altara. Altarans gave allegiance to
a lord or a lady or a town, with little if any left for a nation
called Altara, and few nobles paid taxes, or heed to what the queen
in Ebou Dar said, but they gave heed to an army in their midst. The
Light alone knew what effect the rumors of Dragonsworn had on them.
For the moment, though, they forgot to stare haughtily at one
another or defiantly at Lelaine. Their eyes were fixed on Logain as
they might have been on a huge, brightly colored viper.</p>

<p>To complete the cycle, copper-skinned Burin Shaeren,
looking carved from an uprooted stump, watched both Logain and the
visitors, a man ready to move suddenly and violently in the blink
of an eye. Lelaine&rsquo;s Warder was there only partly to guard
Logain&mdash;supposedly Logain was in Salidar of his own free
will, after all&mdash;and mainly to protect the man from his
visitors and a knife in his heart.</p>

<p>For his part, Logain appeared to flourish under all
those stares. A tall man with curling hair that touched his broad
shoulders, dark and handsome if hard of face, he looked as proud
and confident as an eagle. It was a promise of vengeance that put
the light in his eyes, though. If he could not repay everyone he
wanted to, he could at least repay some. &ldquo;Six Red sisters found me
in Cosamelle about a year before I proclaimed myself,&rdquo; he said as
Nynaeve came in. &ldquo;Javindhra, the leader was called, though one
named Barasine talked a good deal. And I heard Elaida mentioned, as
if she knew what these were about. They found me asleep, and I
thought I was done when they shielded me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aes Sedai,&rdquo; the listening woman broke in harshly.
Stocky and hard-eyed, she had a thin scar across her cheek that
Nynaeve found incongruous on a woman. Altaran women did have a
reputation for fierceness, of course, though very likely overblown.
 &ldquo;Aes Sedai, how can what he claims be true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know how, Lady Sarena,&rdquo; Lelaine said
calmly, &ldquo;but it was confirmed to me by one who cannot lie. He
speaks true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sarena&rsquo;s face did not change, but her hands
clenched into fists behind her back. One of her companions, the
tall gaunt-faced man with more gray hair than black, had his thumbs
tucked behind his sword belt, trying to appear at ease, but his
grip was white-knuckle tight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I was saying,&rdquo; Logain went on with a smooth
smile, &ldquo;they found me, and gave me a choice of death on the spot or
taking what they offered. A strange choice, not at all what I
expected, but not one I had to think long on. They did not come out
and say they had done this before, but there was a practiced feel
to it. They gave no reasons, but it seems clear, looking back.
Bringing in a man who could channel carried little glory; pulling
down a false Dragon, though&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve frowned. He was so casual about it, a man
discussing the day&rsquo;s hunting, yet it was his own downfall he
spoke of, and every word another nail in Elaida&rsquo;s coffin.
Maybe in a coffin for the whole Red Ajah. If the Reds had pushed
Logain to name himself the Dragon Reborn, could they have done the
same for Gorin Rogad or Mazrim Taim? Perhaps for <em>all</em> the
false Dragons throughout history? She could all but see the
thoughts turning in the Altarans&rsquo; minds like gears in a mill,
reluctantly at first, then spinning faster and faster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a whole year they helped me avoid other Aes
Sedai,&rdquo; Logain said, &ldquo;sent messages when one was near, though there
weren&rsquo;t many then. After I proclaimed myself, and began to
gather a following, they sent news of where the king&rsquo;s armies
were, and in what numbers. How else do you think I always knew
where to strike and when?&rdquo; His listeners shifted their feet, as
much for his feral grin as for his words.</p>

<p>He hated Aes Sedai. Nynaeve was sure of that from the
few times she had been able to bring herself to study him. Not that
she had done so since before Min left, or learned anything when she
had. Once she had thought studying him would be looking at the
problem from a different angle&mdash;never was just how different
men were as clear as in using the Power&mdash;but it was worse
than staring into a dark hole; there was nothing there, not even
the hole. All in all, being around Logain was unsettling. He had
watched her every move with a burning intensity that made her
shiver even knowing she could wrap him up in the Power if he so
much as lifted a finger wrong. Not the sort of fervor that
men&rsquo;s eyes often directed at women, but a pure contempt that
never touched his face at all, which made it all the more
horrifying. Aes Sedai had shut him away from the One Power forever;
Nynaeve could imagine her own feelings if anyone did that to her.
He could not revenge himself on all Aes Sedai, however. What he
could do was destroy the Red Ajah, and he was making a fair
beginning to it.</p>

<p>This was the first time three had come at once, but
every week or so brought another lord or lady to hear his tale,
from across Altara and sometimes as far as Murandy, and every one
left looking squeezed flat by what Logain had to say. Small wonder;
the only news more shocking would have been for the Aes Sedai to
admit the Black Ajah really did exist. Well, they were not about to
do that, not publicly, and for much the same reason they held news
of Logain as close as possible. It might have been the Red Ajah who
did this, but they were still Aes Sedai, and too many people could
not tell one Ajah from another. All in all, only a few were brought
to hear Logain, yet every one of that handful was chosen for the
power of the House they led. Houses that now would lend their
support to the Aes Sedai in Salidar, if not always openly, or at
worst, withhold support from Elaida.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Javindhra sent me word when more Aes Sedai came,&rdquo;
Logain said, &ldquo;the ones hunting me, and where they would be, so I
could come on them before they knew.&rdquo; Lelaine&rsquo;s serene,
ageless features hardened for a moment, and Burin&rsquo;s hand
drifted toward his sword hilt. Sisters had died before Logain was
captured. Logain did not seem to notice their reactions. &ldquo;The Red
Ajah never played me false until they betrayed me in the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bearded man was staring at Logain so hard it was
plain he was making himself do it. &ldquo;Aes Sedai, what of his
followers? Perhaps he was safe in the Tower, but he was captured a
good many leagues closer to where we stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were not all killed or captured,&rdquo; the
gaunt-faced lord put in right behind him. &ldquo;Most escaped, melted
away. I know my history, Aes Sedai. Raolin Darksbane&rsquo;s
followers dared attack the White Tower itself after he was taken,
and Guaire Amalasan&rsquo;s as well. We remember too well
Logain&rsquo;s army marching across our lands to want it to come
again, to rescue him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need have no fear of that.&rdquo; Lelaine eyed Logain
with a brief smile, as a woman might a fierce dog she knew tamed to
her leash. &ldquo;He has no more desire for glory, only to make some
small restitution for the harm he did. Besides which, I doubt many
of his former followers would come if he did call, not after he was
carried to Tar Valon in a cage and gentled.&rdquo; Her light laugh, was
echoed by the Altarans, but only after a moment, and weakly.
Logain&rsquo;s face was an iron mask.</p>

<p>Abruptly Lelaine noticed Nynaeve just inside the
doorway, and her eyebrows rose. She had exchanged pleasant words
with Nynaeve more than once, and praised her and Elayne&rsquo;s
supposed discoveries, but she could be as quick as any other Aes
Sedai to call down an Accepted who put a foot wrong.</p>

<p>Nynaeve dropped a curtsy, gesturing with the clay
mug, now empty of tea. &ldquo;Pardon me, Lelaine Sedai. I must take this
back to the kitchen.&rdquo; She darted out into the baking street before
the Aes Sedai could say a word.</p>

<p>Luckily, Myrelle was nowhere in sight now. Nynaeve
was in no mood for yet another lecture on showing responsibility or
holding her temper or any one of a dozen fool things. An even
better piece of luck, Siuan was standing not thirty paces away,
facing Gareth Bryne in the middle of the street with the passing
throng parting around them. Like Myrelle, Siuan showed no sign of
the battering Elayne had reported; perhaps they would have more
respect for <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> if they could not
simply step out and have their blunders Healed. Nynaeve moved
closer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with you, woman?&rdquo; Bryne growled
at Siuan. His gray head lowered over her youthful-seeming one;
booted feet planted wide and fists on hips made him seem as wide as
a boulder. The sweat rolling down his face might have been on
someone else&rsquo;s for all the mind he paid it. &ldquo;I compliment you
on how soft my shirts are, and you snap my head off. And I said you
looked cheerful, hardly the opening of a battle, I thought. It was
a compliment, woman, if not one with roses in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Compliments?&rdquo; Siuan growled right back, blue eyes
blazing up at him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your compliments! It just
pleases you that I have to iron your shirts. You are a smaller man
than I ever thought, Gareth Bryne. Do you expect me to trail after
you like a camp follower when the army marches, hoping for more of
your <em>compliments</em>? And you will not address me so, as <em>
woman</em>! It sounds like &lsquo;Here, dog!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

<p>A vein started throbbing on Bryne&rsquo;s temple. &ldquo;It
pleases me that you keep your word, <em>Siuan</em>. And if the army
ever does march, I expect you to continue keeping it. I never asked
that oath of you; it was your own choice, to try wiggling out of
responsibility for what you did. You never thought you&rsquo;d be
called to keep it, did you? Speaking of the army marching, what
have you heard while groveling for the Aes Sedai and kissing their
feet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In one heartbeat Siuan went from fiery rage to icy
calm. &ldquo;That is no part of my oath.&rdquo; You might have thought her a
young Aes Sedai, standing there straight-backed with that coolly
arrogant defiance, one who had not worked with the Power long
enough to take on agelessness. &ldquo;I will not spy for you. You serve
the Hall of the Tower, Gareth Bryne, on <em>your</em> oath. Your
army will march when the Hall decides. Listen for their words, and
obey when you hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The change in Bryne was as lightning quick. &ldquo;You
would be an enemy worth crossing swords with,&rdquo; he chuckled
admiringly. &ldquo;You would be a better&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; That fast the chuckle
faded back into a glower. &ldquo;The Hall, is it? Bah! You tell Sheriam
she might as well stop avoiding me. What can be done here has been
done. Tell her a wolfhound kept in a cage might as well be a pig
when the wolves come. I didn&rsquo;t gather these men to be sold at
market.&rdquo; With a short nod, he went striding off through the crowd.
Siuan stared after him, frowning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that all about?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked, and Siuan
gave a start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of your business is what it was,&rdquo; she snapped,
smoothing her dress. You would have thought Nynaeve had sneaked up
on her purposely. The woman always took everything personally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it pass,&rdquo; Nynaeve said levelly. She was not
going to let herself be led off down a side trail. &ldquo;What I
won&rsquo;t let pass is studying you.&rdquo; She was going to do something
useful today if it killed her. Siuan opened her mouth, looking
around. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t have Marigan, and right now, I don&rsquo;t
need her. You&rsquo;ve let me near you twice&mdash;twice!&mdash;since I found a clue that something in you might be Healed. I mean
to study you today, and if I don&rsquo;t, I <em>will</em> tell
Sheriam you&rsquo;re disobeying her orders to make yourself
available. I swear I will!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment she thought the other woman was going to
dare her to do her worst, but at last Siuan said grudgingly, &ldquo;This
afternoon. I am busy this morning. Unless you think what you want
is more important than helping your Two Rivers friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve stepped closer. No one in the street was
paying them any mind beyond a glance in passing, but she lowered
her voice anyway. &ldquo;What are they planning about him? You keep
saying they haven&rsquo;t made up their minds what to do, but they
must have come to <em>some</em> conclusion by now.&rdquo; If they had,
Siuan would know of it, whether she was supposed to or not.</p>

<p>Abruptly Leane was there, and Nynaeve might as well
not have spoken. Siuan and Leane glared at one another,
stiff-backed as two strange cats in a small room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Siuan muttered with a tight jaw.</p>

<p>Leane sniffed, and her curls swung as she tossed her
head. A sneer twisted her lips, yet her words did not match
expression or tone. &ldquo;I tried to talk them out of it,&rdquo; she spat, but
softly. &ldquo;Only they had not listened to you enough to even consider
it. You won&rsquo;t be meeting the Wise Ones tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fishguts!&rdquo; Siuan growled, and turning on her heel,
she stalked away, but no more quickly than Leane in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>Nynaeve almost threw up her hands in frustration.
Talking as if she were not there, as if she did not know exactly
what they were talking about. Ignoring her. Siuan had better appear
this afternoon as promised, or she would find a way to wring her
out and hang her up to dry! She jumped as a woman spoke behind
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those two should be sent to Tiana for a sound
switching.&rdquo; Lelaine stepped up beside Nynaeve, looking first after
Siuan then Leane. Going around sneaking up on people! There was no
sign of Logain or Burin or the Altaran nobles. The Blue sister
shifted her shawl. &ldquo;They are not what they were, of course, but one
would think they could retain a little decorum. It will not do if
they actually come to hair-pulling in the street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes people just rub one another the wrong
way,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. Siuan and Leane worked so hard to maintain
their fiction, the least she could do was support it. How she hated
people sneaking up on her.</p>

<p>Lelaine eyed Nynaeve&rsquo;s hand on her braid, and
she snatched it away. Too many knew about that habit; a habit she
had tried hard to break. But what the Aes Sedai said was &ldquo;Not when
it impinges on the dignity of Aes Sedai, child. Women who serve
Aes Sedai should show some reserve in public however silly they are
in private.&rdquo; There was certainly nothing to be said to that;
nothing safe, anyway. &ldquo;Why did you come in where I was showing
Logain just now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought the room was empty, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Nynaeve
said hastily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I hope I did not disturb you.&rdquo; That
was no answer&mdash;she could hardly say she had been hiding from
Myrelle&mdash;but the slender Blue only met her eyes for a
moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think Rand al&rsquo;Thor will do,
child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve blinked in confusion. &ldquo;Aes Sedai, I
haven&rsquo;t seen him in half a year. All I know is what I&rsquo;ve
heard here. Is the Hall&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Aes Sedai, what has the Hall decided
about him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scrutinizing Nynaeve&rsquo;s face, Lelaine pursed her
lips. Those dark eyes, seeming to see inside your head, were quite
unsettling. &ldquo;A remarkable coincidence. You come from the same
village as the Dragon Reborn, and so does that other girl, Egwene
al&rsquo;Vere. Great things were expected when she became a novice.
Do you have any idea where she is?&rdquo; She did not wait for an answer.
 &ldquo;And the other two young men, Perrin Aybara and Mat Cauthon. Both
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> as well, so I understand. Remarkable,
indeed. Then there is you, with your extraordinary discoveries
despite your limitations. Wherever Egwene is, does she also venture
where none of us have gone? All of you have occasioned a good deal
of discussion among the sisters, as you may imagine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope they say good things,&rdquo; Nynaeve said slowly.
There had been many questions about Rand since coming to Salidar,
especially since the embassy left for Caemlyn&mdash;some Aes Sedai
seemed able to speak of little else to her&mdash;but this seemed
something different. That was the trouble with talking to Aes
Sedai. Half the time you could not be sure what they meant or what
they were after.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you still have hopes of Healing Siuan and Leane,
child?&rdquo; Nodding as if Nynaeve had answered, Lelaine sighed.
 &ldquo;Sometimes I think Myrelle is right. We indulge you too much.
Whatever your discoveries, perhaps we should put you in
Theodrin&rsquo;s charge until your block against channeling at will
is broken. Considering what you have done in the last two months,
think what you could do then.&rdquo; Gripping her braid unconsciously,
Nynaeve tried to get a word in edgewise, a carefully framed
protest, but Lelaine ignored the attempt. Which was probably for
the best. &ldquo;You do Siuan and Leane no favors, child. Let them forget
who and what they were and be content with who and what they are.
From the way they behave, the only thing that keeps them from
forgetting completely is you, and your foolish attempts to Heal
what cannot be Healed. They are no longer Aes Sedai. Why hold out
false hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a hint of compassion in her voice, and a
tinge of contempt too. Those not Aes Sedai were less, after all,
and Siuan and Leane&rsquo;s ruse had definitely painted them among
the least. Plus, of course, no few here in Salidar blamed the
Tower&rsquo;s troubles on Siuan, on her plotting while Amyrlin. Very
likely they believed she deserved everything that had happened to
her and more.</p>

<p>What <em>had</em> been done complicated the whole
thing, though. Stilling was rare. Before Siuan and Leane, no woman
had been tried and stilled in one hundred and forty years, and none
burned out in at least a dozen. A stilled woman usually tried to
get as far from Aes Sedai as she could. No doubt if Lelaine had
been stilled, she would want to forget being Aes Sedai if she
could. No doubt she would like to forget that Siuan and Leane had
been, too, that all that had been taken away from them. If they
could be seen as two women never able to channel, never Aes Sedai,
a good many Aes Sedai would be more comfortable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sheriam Sedai has given me permission to try,&rdquo;
Nynaeve said as firmly as she dared to a full sister. Lelaine held
her eyes until she let her gaze drop. Her knuckles whitened around
her braid before she could let go, but she kept her face smooth.
Trying to trade stares with an Aes Sedai was a wool-head&rsquo;s
trick for an Accepted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are all fools sometimes, child, yet a wise woman
learns to limit how often. Since you seem to have finished
breakfast, I suggest you rid yourself of that mug and find
something to do before you find yourself in hot water instead. Have
you ever considered cutting your hair short? No matter. Off with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve dropped a curtsy, but it was being made to
the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s back before she reached the bottom of it. Safe
from Lelaine&rsquo;s eyes, she glowered at the woman. Cut her <em>
hair</em>? She lifted her braid and shook it at the retreating Aes
Sedai. That she had waited until it was safe made her furious,
though if she had not waited she would almost certainly be on her
way to join Moghedien at the laundry, with a stop to see Tiana on
the way. Months sitting here in Salidar doing nothing&mdash;for
all practical purposes it seemed she was, no matter what she and
Elayne managed to pull out of Moghedien&mdash;amid Aes Sedai who
did nothing except talk and wait while the world went on its way to
ruin without them, and Lelaine thought she should cut her hair! She
had pursued the Black Ajah, been captured and escaped, captured one
of the Forsaken in turn&mdash;well, none of them knew that&mdash;helped the Panarch of Tarabon regain her throne however briefly,
and now all she did was sit and take credit for what she could
shake loose from Moghedien. Cut her hair? She might as well shave
herself bald for all the good it would do!</p>

<p>She caught sight of Dagdara Finchey striding through
the throng, as wide as any man in the street and taller than most,
and the round-faced Yellow made her angry, too. One reason she had
chosen to remain in Salidar was to study with the Yellows, for they
knew more of Healing than anyone else; everyone said so. But if any
of them knew more than she already did, they were not sharing it
with a mere Accepted. The Yellows should have been the most
welcoming to her desire to Heal anything and everything, even
stilling, but they were the least. Dagdara would have had her
scrubbing floors from sunup to sundown until she gave up &ldquo;foolish
notions and wasting time&rdquo; if Sheriam had not intervened, while
Nisao Dachen, a diminutive Yellow with eyes that could drive nails,
refused to even speak to Nynaeve as long as she persisted in trying
to &ldquo;alter how the Pattern has been woven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To top it all off, her weather sense still told her a
storm was on its way, closer now, while the cloudless sky and
burning sun taunted her.</p>

<p>Muttering to herself, she tucked the clay mug into
the back of a passing woodcart and set off weaving through the
crowded street. There was nothing to do except keep moving until
Moghedien was free, and the Light knew how long that would be. A
whole morning wasted, added to a string of wasted days.</p>

<p>Many of the Aes Sedai nodded and smiled at her, but
by the simple expedient of smiling back apologetically and
quickening her step for a few paces as if hurrying somewhere, she
avoided stopping for the inevitable questions about what new things
they might expect out of her. In her present mood she might just
tell them exactly what she thought, which would be foolish in the
extreme. Doing nothing. Asking <em>her</em> what Rand was going to
do. Telling her to cut her hair. Bah!</p>

<p>Of course, they were not all smiles. Not only did
Nisao look right through Nynaeve; Nynaeve had to step nimbly out of
the way before the tiny woman walked right over her. And a haughty,
pale-haired Aes Sedai with a prominent chin, guiding a tall roan
gelding through the crowd, cast a sharp blue-eyed frown at her as
she rode by. Nynaeve did not recognize her. The woman was perfectly
neat in a riding dress of pale gray silk, but the light linen
dust-cloak folded in front of her saddle spoke of travel and named
her a new arrival. Adding to the likelihood that she was new come,
the lanky green-coated Warder at her heels on a tall gray warhorse
looked uneasy. Warders <em>never</em> looked uneasy, but Nynaeve
supposed joining a rebellion against the Tower might make for an
exception. Light! Even new arrivals came ready to put her back
up!</p>

<p>And then there was scar-faced Uno, his head shaven
except for a topknot and his missing eye covered by a patch painted
with a hideous glaring red replacement. Pausing in the
leather-lunged flaying of an abashed young man in plate-and-mail
armor who stood holding the reins of a horse with a lance lashed to
the saddle, Uno directed a warm grin in Nynaeve&rsquo;s direction.
Well, it would have been warm without the eyepatch. Nynaeve&rsquo;s
grimace made him blink and hurry back to dressing down the
soldier.</p>

<p>It was not Uno or his eyepatch that soured her
stomach. Not exactly. He had accompanied her and Elayne to Salidar,
and once promised to steal horses&mdash;&ldquo;borrow,&rdquo; he called it&mdash;if they wanted to leave. No chance of that now. Uno wore a
band of golden braid on the cuffs of his worn dark coat now; he was
an officer, training heavy cavalry for Gareth Bryne, and much too
caught up in it to bother himself with Nynaeve. No, that was not
true. If she said she wanted to go, he would procure horses in a
matter of hours, and she would ride with an escort of top-knotted
Shienarans who had given their allegiance to Rand and were only in
Salidar because she and Elayne brought them there. Only, she would
have to admit she had been wrong in deciding to stay, admit she had
been lying all those times she had told him she was happy right
where she was. Making those admissions was just beyond her.
Uno&rsquo;s main reason for staying was that he thought he should
<em>look after</em> her and Elayne. He would hear no admissions
from her!</p>

<p>The whole thought of leaving Salidar was a new one,
sparked by Uno, and it set her thinking fiercely. If only Thom and
Juilin had not gone jaunting off to Amadicia. Not that they had
made the trip for the fun of it, really. Back in the days when it
seemed the Aes Sedai here might really do something, they had
volunteered to scout out what was going on across the river.
Meaning to penetrate as far as Amador itself, they had been gone
well over a month, and would not return for days more at best. They
were not the only scouts, of course; even Aes Sedai and Warders had
been sent, though most of those were aimed farther west, at
Tarabon. A show of doing something, and the delay before any could
return with word was a good excuse to wait. Nynaeve wished she had
not let the two men go. Neither would have, had she said no.</p>

<p>Thom was an old gleeman, though he had once been
considerably more, and Juilin a thief-taker from Tear, both
competent men who knew how to handle themselves in strange places,
and handy in a number of ways. They had accompanied her and Elayne
to Salidar, too, and neither would have asked questions if told she
wanted to leave. Undoubtedly they would have said a good deal
behind her back, but not to her face, the way Uno would.</p>

<p>It was galling to admit that she really needed them,
but she was not sure she knew how to go about stealing a horse. In
any case, an Accepted would be noticed fooling around the horses,
in the stables as much as out on the soldiers&rsquo; picket lines,
and if she changed out of the banded white dress, she would
certainly be seen and reported before she got anywhere near a
horse. Even if she managed it, she would be pursued. Runaway
Accepted, like runaway novices, were almost always brought back to
face punishment that erased any thought of a second attempt. When
you began training to be Aes Sedai, Aes Sedai were not finished
with you until <em>they</em> said they were.</p>

<p>It was not fear of punishment that held her, of
course. What was a switching or two against the chance of being
killed by the Black Ajah, or facing one of the Forsaken? It was
just a matter of whether she really wanted to go. Where would she
go, for instance? To Rand, in Caemlyn? Egwene in Cairhien? Would
Elayne come? Certainly, if they went to Caemlyn. Was it a desire to
<em>do</em> something, or fear that Moghedien was going to be discovered?
The punishment for running away would not be a patch on that! She
had reached no conclusion when she rounded a corner and found
herself looking at Elayne&rsquo;s novice class, gathered in an open
space between two thatch-roofed stone houses where the fallen-in
ruins of a third had been cleared away.</p>

<p>More than twenty white-clad women sat on low stools
in a semicircle, watching Elayne guide two of their number through
an exercise. The glow of <em>saidar</em> surrounded all three
women. Tabiya, a green-eyed freckle-faced girl of sixteen or so,
and Nicola, a slender black-haired woman Nynaeve&rsquo;s age, were
unsteadily passing a small flame back and forth. It wavered and
sometimes vanished for an instant when one was too slow to catch it
up from the other and maintain it. In her present mood, Nynaeve
could clearly see the flows they wove.</p>

<p>Eighteen novices had been whisked away when Sheriam
and the rest fled&mdash;Tabiya was one of those&mdash;but most in
this group were like Nicola, newly recruited since the Aes Sedai
established themselves in Salidar. Nicola was not the only woman
there older than usual for a novice; a good half were. When Nynaeve
and Elayne went to the Tower, Aes Sedai rarely tested women much
older than Tabiya&mdash;Nynaeve had been remarked for her age as
much as for being a wilder&mdash;but perhaps in desperation, the
Aes Sedai here had expanded their testing to women even a year or
two beyond Nynaeve. The result was that Salidar now held more
novices than the White Tower had for years. That success had made
the Aes Sedai send sisters out across Altara in a
village-by-village search.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you wish you were teaching that class?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voice at her shoulder made Nynaeve&rsquo;s stomach
turn over. Twice in one morning. She wished she had some goosemint
in her belt pouch. If she kept letting herself be taken by
surprise, she was going to end up sorting papers for a Brown
yet.</p>

<p>Of course, the apple-cheeked Domani woman was not Aes
Sedai. Back in the Tower, Theodrin would have been raised to the
shawl already, but here she had been raised to something more than
Accepted, less than a full sister. She wore her Great Serpent ring
on her right hand not her left, and a green dress that went well
with her bronze coloring, but she could not choose an Ajah or wear
the shawl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have better things to be about than teaching a
bunch of thickheaded novices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Theodrin only smiled at the tartness in
Nynaeve&rsquo;s voice. She was quite nice, really. &ldquo;A thickheaded
Accepted to teach thickheaded novices?&rdquo; Usually, she was nice.
 &ldquo;Well, once we have you where you can channel without being ready
to thump their heads, you will be teaching novices too. And I would
not be surprised if you were raised soon after, the things
you&rsquo;ve been discovering. You know, you have never told me what
your trick was.&rdquo; Wilders almost always had some trick they had
learned, the first unveiling of the ability to channel. The other
thing most wilders had in common was a block, something they had
built up in their minds to hide their channeling even from
themselves.</p>

<p>Nynaeve kept her face smooth with an effort. To be
able to channel whenever she wanted. To be raised Aes Sedai.
Neither would remedy the problem of Moghedien, but she would be
able to go where she wanted then, study as she wanted without
anyone telling her this or that simply could not be Healed. &ldquo;People
got well when they shouldn&rsquo;t. I would get so mad that somebody
was going to die, that everything I knew about herbs wasn&rsquo;t
enough&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; she shrugged. &ldquo;And they got well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much better than mine.&rdquo; The slender woman sighed. &ldquo;I
could make a boy want to kiss me, or not want to. My block was men,
not anger.&rdquo; Nynaeve looked at her incredulously, and Theodrin
laughed. &ldquo;Well, it was emotion, too. If there was a man present,
and I liked or disliked him a great deal, I could channel. If I
felt neither one way nor the other, or there wasn&rsquo;t a man at
all, I might as well have been a tree so far as <em>saidar</em> was
concerned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you ever break through that?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked
curiously. Elayne had the novices all paired off now, fumbling
their way through passing small flames back and forth.</p>

<p>Theodrin&rsquo;s smile deepened, but a blush stained
her cheeks, too. &ldquo;A young man named Charel, a groom in the Tower
stables, began making eyes at me. I was fifteen, and he had the
most gorgeous smile. The Aes Sedai let him sit in on my lessons,
quietly in a corner, so I could channel at all. What I didn&rsquo;t
know was that Sheriam had arranged for him to meet me in the first
place.&rdquo; Her cheeks darkened more. &ldquo;I also didn&rsquo;t know he had a
twin sister, or that after a few days, the Charel sitting in the
corner was really Marel. When she took off her coat and shirt one
day in the middle of my lesson, I was so shocked I fainted. But
after that, I could channel whenever I wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve burst out laughing&mdash;she could not help
it&mdash;and despite her blushes Theodrin joined in without
restraint. &ldquo;I wish it could be that easy for me, Theodrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whether it is or not,&rdquo; Theodrin said, her laughter
fading, &ldquo;we will break down your block. This afternoon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m studying Siuan this afternoon,&rdquo; Nynaeve cut
in hastily, and Theodrin&rsquo;s mouth tightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been avoiding me, Nynaeve. In the past
month you&rsquo;ve managed to wriggle out of all but three
appointments. I can accept your trying and failing, but I will not
accept you being afraid to try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not,&rdquo; Nynaeve began indignantly, as a small
voice asked whether she was trying to hide the truth from herself.
It was so disheartening to try and try and try&mdash;and fail.</p>

<p>Theodrin let her have no more than those few words.
 &ldquo;Allowing that you have commitments today,&rdquo; she said calmly, &ldquo;I
will see you tomorrow, and every day thereafter, or I will be
forced to take other steps. I don&rsquo;t want to do that, and you
do not want me to, but I mean to break your block down. Myrelle has
asked me to make special efforts, and I vow that I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The near echo of what she had told Siuan made
Nynaeve&rsquo;s jaw drop. This was the first time the other woman
had used the increased authority of her position. It would be just
the way Nynaeve&rsquo;s luck was running today for her and Siuan to
end up waiting to see Tiana side by side.</p>

<p>Theodrin did not wait for a reply. She merely nodded
as if she had received agreement, then glided off up the street.
Nynaeve could almost see a fringed shawl around her shoulders. This
morning was not going well at all. And Myrelle again! She wanted to
scream.</p>

<p>Over among the novices, Elayne gave her a proud
smile, but Nynaeve only shook her head and turned away. She was
going back to her room. It was a measure of how the day was
progressing that before she was halfway there Dagdara Finchey
crashed into her running and knocked her flat on her back. Running!
An Aes Sedai! The big woman did not stop, either, or as much as
shout an apology over her shoulder as she plowed through the
crowd.</p>

<p>Nynaeve picked herself up, dusted herself off,
stumped the rest of the way to her room and slammed the door behind
her. It was hot and close, the beds were unmade until Moghedien
could get around to them, and worst of all, Nynaeve&rsquo;s weather
sense told her there should have been a hailstorm breaking over
Salidar right that minute. But she would not be surprised there, or
trampled.</p>

<p>Flinging herself down atop her rumpled sheets, she
lay fingering the silver bracelet, thoughts skittering from what
she might manage to dig out of Moghedien today to whether Siuan
would appear that afternoon, from Lan to her block to whether she
was going to stay in Salidar. It would not be running away, really.
She would probably go to Caemlyn, to Rand; he did need somebody to
keep his head from swelling too big, and Elayne would like that.
She just wished leaving&mdash;<em>not</em> running away!&mdash;had not begun to seem even more attractive after Theodrin announced
her intentions.</p>

<p>She expected to have some sign in the emotions oozing
through the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> that Moghedien was finished with
her work, and to have to go find her&mdash;she often hid when she
was sulking&mdash;but the shame and outrage never decreased, and
the door banging open came as a complete surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So there you are,&rdquo; Moghedien grated. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; She
held up her hands. &ldquo;Ruined!&rdquo; To Nynaeve they looked no different
from any hands that been doing laundry; white and wrinkled, true,
but that would fade. &ldquo;It is not enough that I must live in squalor,
fetching and carrying like a servant, now I&rsquo;m expected to
labor like some primitive&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve cut her off by a simple expedient. She
thought of one quick stroke of a switch, what it felt like, then
shifted the thought into the part of her mind that held
Moghedien&rsquo;s received emotions. The other woman&rsquo;s dark
eyes widened, and her mouth clamped shut, lips compressing. Not a
hard blow, but a reminder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Close the door and sit down,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;You can
make the beds later. We are going to have a lesson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am used to better than this,&rdquo; Moghedien grumbled
as she complied. &ldquo;A night laborer in Tojar was used to better!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless I miss my guess,&rdquo; Nynaeve told her sharply,
 &ldquo;a night laborer in wherever didn&rsquo;t have a death sentence
hanging over his head. Any time you want it, we can tell Sheriam
exactly who you are.&rdquo; It was pure bluff&mdash;Nynaeve&rsquo;s
stomach clenched up in a burning ball at the mere thought&mdash;but a sickening flood of fear roared out of Moghedien. Nynaeve
almost admired how steady the woman&rsquo;s face remained; had she
felt like that, she would have been shrieking and gnashing her
teeth on the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want me to show you?&rdquo; Moghedien said in
a level tone. They always had to tell her what they wanted out of
her. She practically never volunteered anything unless they pressed
her to a point Nynaeve considered the brink of torture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try something you haven&rsquo;t been very
successful with teaching. Detecting a man&rsquo;s channeling.&rdquo; So
far, that was the only thing she and Elayne had not been able to
pick up quickly. It could be useful if she did decide to go to
Caemlyn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not easy, especially with no man to practice on. A
pity you haven&rsquo;t been able to Heal Logain.&rdquo; There was no
mockery in Moghedien&rsquo;s voice or on her face, but she glanced
at Nynaeve and hurried on. &ldquo;Still, we can try the forms again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lesson truly was not easy. It never was, even
with something Nynaeve could learn right away once the weaves
became clear. Moghedien could not channel without Nynaeve allowing
her to, without Nynaeve guiding her, in fact, but in a new lesson
Moghedien had to give the lead for how the flows were to go. It
made a pretty tangle, the main reason they were not able to learn a
dozen new things from her every day. In this case Nynaeve already
had <em>some</em> idea of how the flows were woven, but it was an
intricate lacework of all of the Five Powers that made Healing seem
simple, and the pattern shifted at blinding speed. Its difficulty
was the reason it had never been used very often, Moghedien
claimed. It also gave you a grinding headache if kept up very
long.</p>

<p>Nynaeve lay back on her bed and worked at it as hard
as she could, though. If she did go to Rand, she might need this,
and there was no telling how soon. She channeled the flows all by
herself, too; an occasional thought of Lan or Theodrin kept her
anger twisted up tight enough. Sooner or later Moghedien was going
to be called to account for her crimes, and where would Nynaeve be
then, used to drawing on the other woman&rsquo;s power whenever she
wanted? She had to live and work with her own limits. <em>
Could</em> Theodrin find a way to break her block? Lan had to be
alive, so she could find him. The ache became a pain that bored at
her temples. A tightness appeared around Moghedien&rsquo;s eyes, and
she rubbed at her head sometimes, but underneath the fear the
bracelet carried a current of what almost seemed contentment.
Nynaeve supposed that even when you did not want to teach, it must
bring a certain satisfaction. She was not sure she liked Moghedien
displaying such a normal human response.</p>

<p>She was not sure how long the lesson went on, with
Moghedien murmuring, &ldquo;Almost&rdquo; and &ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; but when the door
banged open again, she nearly lifted straight up off the mattress.
The sudden bolt of fear from Moghedien would have accompanied
howling in another woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you heard, Nynaeve?&rdquo; Elayne asked, pushing the
door to. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an emissary from the Tower, from
Elaida.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve forgot the words she would have shouted if
her heart had not been clogging her throat. She even forgot her
headache. &ldquo;An emissary? You&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m sure, Nynaeve. Do you think
I&rsquo;d come running for <em>gossip</em>? The whole village is
aflutter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why,&rdquo; Nynaeve said sourly. The
grating inside her skull was back. And all the goosemint in her
scrip of herbs under the bed would not have quieted the burning in
her stomach. Would the girl never learn to knock? Moghedien had
both hands pressed to her belly as though she could use some
goosemint as well. &ldquo;We did tell them Elaida knew about
Salidar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe they believed us,&rdquo; Elayne said, dropping onto
the foot of Nynaeve&rsquo;s bed, &ldquo;and maybe they didn&rsquo;t, but
this drove it home. Elaida knows where we are, and likely what we
are up to. Any of the servants could be her eyes-and-ears. Maybe
even some of the sisters. I caught a glimpse of the emissary,
Nynaeve. Pale yellow hair and blue eyes that could freeze the sun.
A Red named Tarna Feir, Faolain said. One of the Warders who was
keeping guard escorted her in. When she looks at you, she could be
looking at a stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve looked at Moghedien. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re done with
the lesson for now. Come back in an hour and you can make the
beds.&rdquo; She waited until Moghedien had gone, tight-lipped and
gripping her skirts in fists, then turned to Elayne. &ldquo;What&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;message did she bring?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They certainly didn&rsquo;t tell me, Nynaeve. Every
Aes Sedai I passed was wondering the same thing. I heard when Tarna
was told she&rsquo;d be received by the Hall of the Tower, she
laughed. And not as if she was amused. You do not think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
Elayne chewed at her underlip for a moment. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think
they could really decide to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go back?&rdquo; Nynaeve said incredulously. &ldquo;Elaida will
want them to come the last ten miles on their knees, and the final
mile on their bellies! Even if she didn&rsquo;t, even if this Red
says, &lsquo;Come home. All is forgiven and dinner&rsquo;s
waiting,&rsquo; do you think they could brush aside Logain so
easily?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve, Aes Sedai could brush aside anything to
make the White Tower whole again. Anything. You don&rsquo;t
understand them the way I do; there were Aes Sedai in the palace
from the day I was born. The question now is, what is Tarna saying
to the Hall? And what are they saying to her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve rubbed her arms irritably. She had no
answers, only hopes, and her weather sense told her that that
hailstorm that was not there was beating the roofs of Salidar like
drums. The feeling went on for days.</p>
