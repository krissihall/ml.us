<h4><em>The Amyrlin Is Raised</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>gwene
raised her head from the pillows and looked
around, for a moment surprised to find herself in a canopied bed in
a large room. Early-morning light spilled in at the windows, and a
plumply pretty woman in a simple gray wool dress was setting a
large white pitcher of hot water on the wash-stand. Chesa had been
introduced to her last night as her maid. The Amyrlin&rsquo;s maid.
A covered tray already sat beside her comb and brush on a narrow
table beneath a mirror with a silver-worked frame. The smell of hot
bread and stewed pears drifted in the air.</p>

<p>Anaiya had prepared the room for Egwene&rsquo;s
arrival. The furnishings still did not match, but they were the
best Salidar had to offer, from the padded armchair upholstered in
green silk to the stand-mirror in the corner with all its gilding
intact to the ornately carved wardrobe where her belongings now
hung. Unfortunately, Anaiya&rsquo;s taste seemed to run heavily to
frothy lace and frills. Both thickly bordered the canopy of the bed
and the drawn-back bed curtains, and one or the other decked the
table and its stool, the arms and legs of the padded chair, the
coverlet Egwene had tossed on the floor and the thin silk sheet
that had followed. The curtains at the windows were lace, too.
Egwene put her head back down. Lace edged the pillows as well. The
room made her feel she might drown in lace.</p>

<p>There had been a great deal of talk after Sheriam and
the others brought her here to what they called the Little Tower,
almost all of it on their side. They were not really interested in
what she thought Rand was up to, or what Coiren and the others
might want. There was an embassy on its way to Caemlyn under
Merana, who knew what to do, though they were rather vague about
exactly what that was. For the most part, they did the talking, she
the listening, her questions brushed aside. The answers to some
were unimportant, she was told, for now anyway; those that were
answered got a quick gloss before they went on to what was
important. Embassies had been sent off to every ruler, each one
named in turn, with an explanation of why he or she was absolutely
vital to Salidar&rsquo;s cause, which it seemed every one was. They
did not quite say everything would fail if even one ruler went
against them, but the emphasis they laid on every one said it for
them. Gareth Bryne was building an army that would eventually be
strong enough to prosecute their&mdash;her&mdash;claims against
Elaida, if it came to that. They did not seem to think it would,
despite Elaida&rsquo;s demand that they return to the Tower; they
seemed to believe that once word of Egwene al&rsquo;Vere&rsquo;s
elevation to the Amyrlin Seat was spread, Aes Sedai would come to
her, even some of those in the Tower now, enough that Elaida would
have no choice but to step down on demand. The Whitecloaks were
twiddling their thumbs for some reason, so Salidar was as safe as
anywhere for as long as was necessary. That Logain had been Healed
as well as Siuan&mdash;and Leane; of course she would have been
Healed if she was here; it was just a surprise to find out she was&mdash;came up almost in passing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Nothing to worry you there,&rdquo; Sheriam said
soothingly. She stood over Egwene, who sat in the padded armchair,
with the others in an arc around her. &ldquo;The Hall will argue whether
to gentle him again until old age relieves us of the
problem.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Egwene tried to stifle another yawn&mdash;it was
getting late&mdash;and Anaiya said, &ldquo;We need to let her sleep.
Tomorrow is almost as important as tonight was, child.&rdquo; Abruptly
she laughed to herself softly. &ldquo;Mother. Tomorrow is important too,
Mother. We will send Chesa to help you get ready for bed.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even after they left, going to bed was not easy.
While Chesa was still undoing Egwene&rsquo;s dress, Romanda appeared
with a number of suggestions for the Amyrlin, delivered in a firm
no-nonsense voice, and no sooner did she go than Lelaine came, as
if the Blue Sitter had been waiting for the Yellow&rsquo;s
departure. Lelaine had her own helpful counsel, given with Egwene
sitting up in bed after Chesa was gently but firmly put out of the
room. It was not a bit like Romanda&rsquo;s advice&mdash;neither
was much like Sheriam&rsquo;s&mdash;and came with a warm, even
affectionate, smile, but with just as much certainty that Egwene
would need a little guidance in her first months. Neither woman
exactly said that she could guide Egwene to what was best for the
Tower better than Sheriam, or that Sheriam and her little circle
might try to tug in too many directions, or that they might give
bad advice, but the strong implications were there. Romanda and
Lelaine also each hinted that the other might have her own agenda,
one that undoubtedly would cause untold misery.</p>

<p>By the time Egwene channeled the last lamp out, she
expected a sleep full of nightmares. In fact there were only two
that she remembered the next morning. In one she was Amyrlin&mdash;Aes Sedai, but without taking the oaths&mdash;and everything she
did led to disaster. That wakened her bolt upright, just to get
away, yet she was sure it was not a dream with meaning. It was much
the same as one of her experiences inside the <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> where she had been tested for Accepted; as
far as anyone knew, those had no connection to reality. Not to this
reality. The other was the sort of foolishness she expected; she
knew enough about her own dreams now to know that, even if she had
to wake herself finally to escape that one as well. Sheriam had
snatched the stole from her shoulders, and then everyone was
laughing at her and pointing at the fool who really believed a girl
of barely eighteen years could be Amyrlin. Not just the Aes Sedai,
but all the Wise Ones, and Rand and Perrin and Mat, Nynaeve and
Elayne, almost everyone she had ever met, while she stood there
naked, desperately trying to put on an Accepted&rsquo;s dress that
might have fit a ten-year-old child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you can&rsquo;t be lying abed all day,
Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene opened her eyes.</p>

<p>Chesa had an expression of mock severity on her face
and a twinkle in her eye. At least twice Egwene&rsquo;s age, at
their first meeting she had fallen straight into the blend of
respect and familiarity that could be expected of an old retainer.
 &ldquo;The Amyrlin Seat can&rsquo;t be lying slugabed, not today of all
days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last thing in my mind.&rdquo; Scrambling stiffly from
the bed, Egwene stretched before pulling off her sweaty shift. She
could not wait until she had worked long enough with the Power to
stop sweating. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wear the blue silk with the white
morningstars along the neckline.&rdquo; She noticed Chesa very carefully
not looking as the woman handed her a fresh shift. The effects of
meeting her <em>toh</em> had faded somewhat, but she still appeared
faintly bruised. &ldquo;I had an accident before I got here,&rdquo; she said,
hurriedly thrusting her head through the new shift.</p>

<p>Chesa nodded in sudden understanding. &ldquo;Horses are
wicked, untrustworthy beasts. You&rsquo;ll never get me on one,
Mother. A good sturdy cart is ever so much safer. If I fell off a
horse like that, I&rsquo;d never let on to a soul. Nildra would say
such things, and Kaylin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;oh, you&rsquo;d never believe the
things some women can say the moment your back is turned. Of
course, it&rsquo;s different for the Amyrlin Seat, but that&rsquo;s
what I&rsquo;d do.&rdquo; Holding the wardrobe door open, she glanced
sideways at Egwene to see whether she understood.</p>

<p>Egwene smiled at her. &ldquo;People are people, low or
high,&rdquo; she said gravely.</p>

<p>Chesa beamed for an instant before bringing out the
blue dress. Sheriam might have chosen her, but she was the Amyrlin
Seat&rsquo;s maid, and her loyalty was to the Amyrlin Seat. And she
was right about today&rsquo;s importance, too.</p>

<p>Eating quickly&mdash;despite Chesa&rsquo;s murmurs to
herself about how gulping food always upset the stomach; the warm
milk with honey and spices was sovereign for settling a nervous
stomach&mdash;Egwene scrubbed her teeth and washed hurriedly, let
Chesa take a few licks at her hair with the brush and dressed as
fast as the woman could get the blue silk over her head. Settling
the seven-striped stole on her shoulders, she paused to look in the
stand-mirror. Stole or no stole, she did not look very much like
the Amyrlin Seat. <em>But I am. This is no dream</em>.</p>

<p>In the large room below, the tables stood as empty as
they had in the night. Only the Sitters were there, wearing their
shawls and clustered according to Ajah, and Sheriam standing alone.
They quieted as Egwene descended the stair, curtsied when she
reached the bottom. Romanda and Lelaine eyed her sharply, then
turned away, very obviously not looking at Sheriam, and resumed
their conversations. When Egwene remained silent, the others did
the same. Occasionally one of them glanced at her. Even in whispers
their voices sounded too loud. There was silence outside; utter
stillness. Egwene plucked her handkerchief from her sleeve and
patted her face. None of <em>them</em> sweated a drop.</p>

<p>Sheriam came to stand beside her. &ldquo;It will go well,&rdquo;
she said softly. &ldquo;Just remember what you are to say.&rdquo; That was
another thing they had gone over in detail last night; Egwene had a
speech to deliver this morning.</p>

<p>Egwene nodded. It was strange. Her stomach should
have been turning over, her knees shaking. They were not, and she
could not understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no need to be anxious,&rdquo; Sheriam said. She
sounded as if she thought Egwene was, and meant to soothe her, but
before she could open her mouth again, Romanda spoke loudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a rustle of skirts the Sitters lined up according
to age, with Romanda in the lead this time, and marched outside.
Egwene moved to just short of the door. Still no flutters. Maybe
Chesa was right about the warm milk.</p>

<p>Silence still, then Romanda&rsquo;s voice, too loud
for nature. &ldquo;We have an Amyrlin Seat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene stepped outside into a heat she would not have
expected until later in the day. As her foot left the stoop, it
landed on a platform woven of Air. The lines of Sitters stretched
out to either side of her, each Sitter glowing with the light of
<em>saidar</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egwene al&rsquo;Vere,&rdquo; Romanda intoned, her voice
carried by weaves of the Power, &ldquo;the Watcher of the Seals, the
Flame of Tar Valon, the Amyrlin Seat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They lifted her high as Romanda spoke, raising the
Amyrlin in truth, until she stood just below the thatched roof,
standing on thin air it would seem to any but a woman who could
channel.</p>

<p>There were plenty to see her outlined by the rising
sun; a second weave made the light into a shimmering weave around
her. Men and women packed the street. The crowd disappeared around
corners. Every doorway was filled, every window, every rooftop
except that of the Little Tower itself. A roar erupted that very
nearly drowned out Romanda, waves of cheering that rolled across
the village. Egwene scanned the crowd searching for Nynaeve and
Elayne, but she could not find them in that sea of upturned faces.
An age seemed to pass before there was quiet enough for her to
speak. The weave that had carried Romanda&rsquo;s voice shifted to
her.</p>

<p>They had prepared her speech, Sheriam and the others,
a weighty exhortation she might have been able to deliver without
blushing if she was twice her age, or better yet three times. She
had made a few changes on her own. &ldquo;We are gathered together in a
quest for truth and justice that will not end until the false
Amyrlin Elaida is removed from the place she usurped.&rdquo; The only
change in that was &ldquo;will not&rdquo; for &ldquo;cannot,&rdquo; but she thought it
stronger and better. &ldquo;As Amyrlin, I will lead you in that quest,
and I will not falter, as I know you will not.&rdquo; And that was quite
enough exhortation; in any case, she had no intention of remaining
up here long enough to repeat everything they wanted said. It all
amounted to what she already had said anyway. &ldquo;As my Keeper of the
Chronicles, I name Sheriam Bayanar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That produced a much smaller cheer; a Keeper was not
an Amyrlin, after all. Egwene glanced down, waiting until she saw
Sheriam hurry outside, still draping her shoulders with the stole
of the Keeper, blue to show she had been raised from the Blue Ajah.
It had been decided not to make a copy of the Amyrlin&rsquo;s staff,
topped with a golden flame, that the Keeper carried; until the true
staff was recovered from the White Tower, they would have to do
without. Sheriam had been expecting a much longer wait, and she
looked at Egwene with open exasperation. In the lines of Sitters,
Romanda and Lelaine wore no expression at all; each had had her own
very strong suggestion for Keeper, and needless to say, neither had
been Sheriam.</p>

<p>Egwene drew breath and turned back to the waiting
crowd. &ldquo;In honor of this day, I hereby decree that all Accepted and
novices are absolved of penances and punishments.&rdquo; That was
customary, and produced shouts of glee only from white-clad girls
and a few Accepted who forgot themselves. &ldquo;In honor of this day, I
hereby decree that Theodrin Dabei, Faolain Orande, Nynaeve
al&rsquo;Meara and Elayne Trakand are from this moment raised to the
shawl, full sisters and Aes Sedai.&rdquo; A sort of questioning silence
greeted that, with here and there a murmur. It was not according to
custom at all; far from it. But it was said, and a good thing
Morvrin had happened to mention Theodrin and Faolain. Time to
return to what they had written out for her. &ldquo;I hereby decree this
a day of feasting and celebration. Let no work be done but what is
necessary for enjoyment. May the Light shine on you all, and the
Creator&rsquo;s hand shelter you.&rdquo; That last was swallowed by a
tumultuous roar that overwhelmed the weave carrying her words. Some
people began dancing in the street right there and then, though
there was hardly room for them to move.</p>

<p>The platform of Air descended perhaps a trifle more
quickly than it had risen. The Sitters were staring at her when she
stepped off, and the glow of <em>saidar</em> began winking out
among them almost before she touched ground.</p>

<p>Sheriam darted up to take Egwene&rsquo;s arm, smiling
at the stone-faced Sitters. &ldquo;I must show the Amyrlin her study.
Forgive me.&rdquo; Egwene would not exactly have said Sheriam hustled her
inside, but then again, she would not exactly have said she did
not. She did not think Sheriam would actually try to drag her, but
it seemed best to gather her skirts with her free hand and take
longer strides so as not to find out.</p>

<p>Her study, at the back of the waiting room, turned
out to be somewhat smaller than her bedroom, with two windows, a
writing table, a straight-backed chair behind it and two more in
front. Nothing else. The beetle-riddled wall panels had been waxed
to a dull shine, but the tabletop was quite bare. There was a piece
of flowered carpet on the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me if I was abrupt, Mother,&rdquo; Sheriam said,
releasing her arm, &ldquo;but I thought we should speak privately before
you spoke to any of the Sitters. They all had a hand in writing
your speech, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I made a few changes,&rdquo; Egwene said with a
bright smile, &ldquo;but I felt such a mudgin standing up there with all
that to say.&rdquo; <em>All</em> of them had a hand? No wonder it had
sounded like a pompous old woman who could not stop talking. She
almost laughed. &ldquo;Anyway, I said what had to be said, the heart of
it. Elaida must be removed, and I will lead them to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Sheriam said slowly, &ldquo;but there might be a few
questions about some of the other&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;changes. Theodrin and
Faolain will certainly be raised Aes Sedai as soon as we have the
Tower and the Oath Rod back, and very likely Elayne, but Nynaeve
still can&rsquo;t light a candle unless she yanks her braid at
people first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was exactly the point I wished to raise,&rdquo;
Romanda said, coming in without knocking. &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she added after
a distinct pause. Lelaine shut the door behind them, nearly in the
faces of several other Sitters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seemed necessary,&rdquo; Egwene said, widening her
eyes. &ldquo;I thought of it last night. I&rsquo;ve been raised Aes Sedai
without being tested or taking the Three Oaths, and if I was the
only one, it would just point me out. With four others, I
won&rsquo;t seem quite so odd anymore. Not to people here, at least.
Elaida might try to make something of it when she hears, but most
folk know so little about Aes Sedai, they won&rsquo;t know what to
believe anyway. It is the people here who matter most. They must
have confidence in me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anyone but Aes Sedai would have gaped at her. As it
was, Romanda very nearly spluttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may be so,&rdquo; Lelaine began sharply, giving her
blue-fringed shawl a jerk, then stopped. It was so. More, the
Amyrlin Seat had publicly decreed those women Aes Sedai. The Hall
might be able to keep them Accepted&mdash;or whatever Theodrin and
Faolain were, in their cases&mdash;but the Hall could not erase
memories, and it would not stop everyone knowing they had gone
against the Amyrlin on her first day. A great deal that would do
for confidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope, Mother,&rdquo; Romanda said in a tight voice,
 &ldquo;that you will consult the Hall first the next time. Going against
custom can have unexpected consequences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going against law can have unfortunate ones,&rdquo;
Lelaine said bluntly, tacking on a belated, &ldquo;Mother.&rdquo; That was
nonsense, or close to it. The conditions for being raised Aes Sedai
were set in law, true, but the Amyrlin could decree almost anything
she wished. Still, a wise Amyrlin did not jump into fights with the
Hall when they could be avoided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I will consult in the future,&rdquo; Egwene told them
earnestly. &ldquo;But it did seem the right thing to do. Please, would
you excuse me now? I really do need to speak with the Keeper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They practically quivered. Their curtsies were
slight, their parting words perfectly correct so far as the words
went, but muttered in Romanda&rsquo;s case, and in Lelaine&rsquo;s,
sharp enough to cut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You handled that very well,&rdquo; Sheriam said when they
were gone. She sounded surprised. &ldquo;But you must remember the Hall
can make problems for any Amyrlin. One reason I am your Keeper is
so that I can advise you, and keep you away from that sort of
problem. You should ask me about any decrees you want to make. And
if I&rsquo;m not at hand, Myrelle and Morvrin and the others. We are
here to help you, Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand, Sheriam. I promise to listen carefully
to whatever you say. I&rsquo;d like to see Nynaeve and Elayne, if
that is possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It should be,&rdquo; Sheriam said, smiling, &ldquo;though I may
have to pull Nynaeve away from a Yellow physically. Siuan is coming
to teach you about the etiquette of being Amyrlin&mdash;there is a
great deal of it to learn&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll tell her to come a
little later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene stared at the door after Sheriam had gone.
Then she turned and stared at the table. Absolutely bare. Not a
report to be read, no records to study. Not so much as pen and ink
to write a note, much less a decree. And Siuan coming to teach her
etiquette.</p>

<p>When a timid tap came at the door, she was still
standing there. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, wondering whether it was Siuan,
or perhaps a servant with a snack of honeycakes, already cut into
suitably small pieces.</p>

<p>Nynaeve poked her head in hesitantly, then was pushed
into the room by Elayne. Side by side, they made perfect deep
curtsies, spreading white, banded skirts wide and murmuring,
 &ldquo;Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; Egwene said. Actually,
it was more of a wail. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only two friends I have,
and if you start&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Light, she was almost ready to cry!</p>

<p>Elayne reached her first by a hair, throwing her arms
around her. Nynaeve was silent, fiddling nervously with a slim
silver bracelet, but not Elayne. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re still your friends,
Egwene, but you <em>are</em> the Amyrlin Seat. Light, remember I told you
one day you&rsquo;d be the Amyrlin when I was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Elayne
grimaced faintly. &ldquo;Well, in any case, you <em>are</em>. We
can&rsquo;t just walk up to the Amyrlin and say, &lsquo;Egwene, does
this dress make me look fat?&rsquo; It would not be proper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes it would,&rdquo; Egwene said stoutly. &ldquo;Well, in
private,&rdquo; she allowed after a moment. &ldquo;When we&rsquo;re alone, I
<em>want</em> you to tell me a dress makes me look fat, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;or
whatever you want.&rdquo; Smiling at Nynaeve, she tugged the woman&rsquo;s
thick braid gently. Nynaeve gave a start. &ldquo;And I want you to pull
that at me, if you feel like it. I need somebody who is
Egwene&rsquo;s friend and doesn&rsquo;t see this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;this <em>
bloody</em> stole all the time, or I will go crazy. Speaking of
dresses, why are you still in those? I thought sure you could be
changed by now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve did pull at her braid then. &ldquo;That Nisao told
me it must be some sort of mistake and dragged me off. She said she
wasn&rsquo;t going to waste her turn just for a celebration.&rdquo; The
sounds of it were beginning to rise outside, a general hum just
loud enough to penetrate the stone walls, and a faint thread of
music.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it was no mistake,&rdquo; Egwene said. Nisao&rsquo;s
turn? Well, she was not going to ask now; Nynaeve was not happy
about it, and Egwene wanted this to be as happy an occasion as it
could. Dragging the chair from behind the table, she saw two plump
patchwork cushions on the seat and smiled. Chesa. &ldquo;We are going to
sit here and talk, and then I will help you find the two best
dresses in Salidar. Tell me about these discoveries of yours.
Anaiya mentioned them, and Sheriam, but I could not make them hold
still long enough to give me any details.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Almost as one, the pair paused in the act of sitting
and exchanged glances. Unaccountably, they seemed reluctant to talk
of anything but Nynaeve&rsquo;s Healing Siuan and Leane&mdash;Nynaeve repeated three times rather anxiously that Healing Logain
had been an accident&mdash;and Elayne&rsquo;s work with <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>. Those were remarkable feats, especially
Nynaeve&rsquo;s, but there was only so much they could say, and
there were only so many times Egwene could tell them how marvelous
what they had done was and how much she envied them. Trying to
demonstrate did not last long; Egwene had no real feel for Healing,
especially not this complicated tapestry Nynaeve wove without
thought, and though she had an affinity for metals and very good
strength in both Fire and Earth, Elayne lost her almost
immediately. Of course they wanted to know what life was like among
the Aiel. From the startled blinks and shocked laughs, abruptly cut
off, she was not sure they believed everything she told them, and
she certainly did not tell everything. The Aiel led naturally into
Rand. Both women stared all through her rendition of his meeting
with the Aes Sedai. They agreed that he was wading waters deeper
than he knew and needed someone to guide him before he stepped into
a hole. Elayne thought Min might help with that, once the embassy
reached Caemlyn&mdash;this was the first Egwene knew Min was with
him, or had been in Salidar&mdash;though in truth, Elayne seemed
rather halfhearted. And she muttered something truly peculiar, as
if it were a truth she did not like hearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Min is a better woman than I am.&rdquo; For some reason,
that got a sympathetic look from Nynaeve. &ldquo;I wish <em>I</em> were
there,&rdquo; Elayne went on in a stronger voice. &ldquo;To guide him, I mean.&rdquo;
She looked from Egwene to Nynaeve, red touching her cheeks. &ldquo;Well,
that, too.&rdquo; Nynaeve and Egwene began laughing so hard they nearly
fell out of their chairs, and Elayne joined in almost
immediately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one good thing to tell, Elayne,&rdquo; Egwene
said breathlessly, still trying to recover. Then she realized
exactly what she was going to say, and why. Light, what a mire she
had stepped into, and while laughing! &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about your
mother, Elayne. You don&rsquo;t know how I wished I could offer my
condolences before this.&rdquo; Elayne looked confused, as well she
might. &ldquo;The point is, Rand means to give you the Lion Throne <em>
and</em> the Sun Throne.&rdquo; To her surprise, Elayne sat up very
straight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He does, does he?&rdquo; she said in a cool flat voice.
 &ldquo;He intends to give them to me.&rdquo; Her chin rose slightly. &ldquo;I have
some claim to the Sun Throne, and if I choose to make it, I will do
so in my own right. As for the Lion Throne, Rand al&rsquo;Thor has
no right&mdash;none!&mdash;to <em>give</em> me what is mine
already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he didn&rsquo;t mean it that way,&rdquo;
Egwene protested. Did he? &ldquo;He loves you, Elayne. I know he
does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If only it were that simple,&rdquo; Elayne muttered,
whatever that was supposed to mean.</p>

<p>Nynaeve sniffed. &ldquo;Men always say they didn&rsquo;t
mean it that way. You would think they spoke a different
language.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I put my hands on him again,&rdquo; Elayne said
firmly, &ldquo;I will teach him to speak the right language. <em>
Give</em> me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was all Egwene could do not to laugh again. The
next time Elayne laid hands on Rand she would be too busy hunting a
secluded spot to teach him anything. This was very like old times.
 &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re Aes Sedai, you can go to him any time you want.
Nobody can stop you.&rdquo; A quick look passed between the pair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Hall isn&rsquo;t letting anyone just pick up and
leave,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. &ldquo;And even if she could, we found something I
think is more important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne nodded vigorously. &ldquo;I think so, too. I&rsquo;ll
admit, the first thought I had when I heard you announced Amyrlin
was that now maybe Nynaeve and I could go find it. Well, the
second; the first was a sort of stunned joy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene blinked in confusion. &ldquo;You found something.
But now you need to find it.&rdquo; Leaning forward in their chairs, they
answered eagerly and almost on top of one another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We found it,&rdquo; Elayne said, &ldquo;but only in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We used need,&rdquo; Nynaeve added. &ldquo;We certainly needed
<em>something</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bowl,&rdquo; Elayne continued, &ldquo;a <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, and I think it might be strong enough to
change the weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only, the bowl is somewhere in Ebou Dar, in an
awful, tangled warren of streets with no signs or anything to help.
The Hall sent a letter to Merilille, but she&rsquo;ll never find
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Especially since she is supposed to be busy
convincing Queen Tylin that the <em>real</em> White Tower is
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We told them it needed a man in the channeling.&rdquo;
Nynaeve sighed. &ldquo;Of course, that was before Logain, though I
don&rsquo;t think they would trust him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t really need a man,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;We
just wanted to make them believe they <em>needed</em> Rand. I
don&rsquo;t know how many women it does need; maybe a full circle of
thirteen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne says it&rsquo;s very powerful, Egwene. It
could make the weather right again. I&rsquo;d welcome that just to
get my weather sense straight again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bowl <em>can</em> make it right, Egwene.&rdquo; Elayne
exchanged happy looks with Nynaeve. &ldquo;All you have to do is send us
to Ebou Dar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The flood receded, and Egwene leaned back in her
chair. &ldquo;I will do what I can. Maybe there&rsquo;ll be no objection,
now that you&rsquo;re Aes Sedai.&rdquo; She had the feeling there would
be, though. Raising them had seemed such a bold stroke, but she was
beginning to believe it was not quite so simple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you can?&rdquo; Elayne said incredulously. &ldquo;You are
the Amyrlin Seat, Egwene. You give a command, and Aes Sedai jump.&rdquo;
She flashed a quick grin. &ldquo;Say &lsquo;jump,&rsquo; and I&rsquo;ll prove
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grimacing, Egwene shifted on the cushions. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
the Amyrlin, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Elayne, Sheriam doesn&rsquo;t have to think
very hard to recall a novice named Egwene, staring goggle-eyed at
everything and being sent to rake the New Garden walks for eating
apples after bedtime. She means to lead me by the hand, or maybe
push me by the scruff of my neck. Romanda and Lelaine both wanted
to be Amyrlin, and they see that novice too. They intend to show me
where to put my feet as much as Sheriam does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve frowned worriedly, but Elayne was pure
indignation. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t let them get away with trying to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to <em>bully</em> you. You are the <em>Amyrlin</em>. The Amyrlin
tells the Hall what to do, not the other way around. You have to
stand up and make them <em>see</em> the Amyrlin Seat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s laugh had a touch of bitterness. Had it
only been last night that she was so defiant about being bullied?
 &ldquo;That will take a little time, Elayne. You see, I finally
understood why they chose me. Part is for Rand, I think. Maybe they
believe he&rsquo;ll be more amenable if he sees me wearing the
stole. The other part is because they remember that novice. A woman&mdash;no; a girl!&mdash;who&rsquo;s so used to doing as she&rsquo;s
told that there will be no trouble making her do as they want.&rdquo; She
fingered the striped stole around her neck. &ldquo;Well, whatever their
reasons, they chose me Amyrlin, and since they did, I mean to <em>
be</em> Amyrlin, but I have to be careful, at first anyway. Maybe
Siuan made the Hall jump every time she frowned&rdquo;&mdash;she
wondered whether that had ever been true&mdash;&ldquo;but if I try that,
I might just be the first Amyrlin ever deposed the day after she
was raised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne looked dumbfounded, but Nynaeve nodded slowly.
Perhaps being Wisdom and dealing with the Women&rsquo;s Circle back
home had given her more insight into how the Amyrlin Seat and the
Hall of the Tower actually worked together than all of
Elayne&rsquo;s training to be Queen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne, once word spreads and rulers know about me,
I can begin making the Hall realize they chose an Amyrlin, not a
puppet, but until then, they really could take this stole away as
fast as they gave it. I mean, if I&rsquo;m not really Amyrlin, then
it isn&rsquo;t hard to push me aside. There might be a few mutters,
but I have no doubt they could smooth those over fast enough. If
anyone outside Salidar ever heard somebody named Egwene
al&rsquo;Vere was raised Amyrlin, it would just be one of those
peculiar rumors that grow up around Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; Elayne asked quietly.
 &ldquo;You are not going to accept it meekly.&rdquo; That made Egwene smile
wholeheartedly. It was not a question, but a firm statement of
fact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I am not.&rdquo; She had listened to a number of
Moiraine&rsquo;s lectures to Rand about the Game of Houses. Back
then, she had thought the Game absurd, and worse than underhanded.
Now she hoped she could remember everything she had heard. The Aiel
always said, &lsquo;Use the weapons you have.&rsquo; It may help
that they&rsquo;re trying to fit me for three different leashes. I
can pretend to be pulled by one or another, depending on which is
closest to what I want to do. Once in a while I can just do what I
want, the way I did raising you two, but not very often yet.&rdquo;
Squaring her shoulders, she met their gazes levelly. &ldquo;I would like
to say I raised you because you deserved it, but the truth is, I
did it because you&rsquo;re my friends, and because I hope as full
sisters you can help me. I certainly don&rsquo;t know who else I can
trust except you two. I will send you to Ebou Dar as soon as I can,
but before and after, you are who I can discuss things with. I know
you will tell me the truth. That trip to Ebou Dar may not take as
long as you might think. You two have made all sorts of
discoveries, so I hear, but if I can puzzle a few things out, I may
have one of my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be wonderful,&rdquo; Elayne said, but she
sounded almost absentminded.</p>
