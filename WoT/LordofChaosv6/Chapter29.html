<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">P</span>ausing
in the shade in front of the Little Tower,
Nynaeve carefully dabbed at her face, then tucked the handkerchief
back up her sleeve. Not that it did much good&mdash;sweat popped
out again right away&mdash;but she wanted to look her best inside.
She wanted to look cool, serene, dignified. Small chance of that.
Her temples were throbbing, and her stomach felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;fragile; she
had not been able to look at breakfast this morning. Just the heat,
of course, but she wanted to go back to her bed, curl up and die.
To top it off, her weather sense was nagging at her; the molten sun
should have been hidden by roiling black clouds and threatening
bolts of lightning.</p>

<p>The Warders lounging out front did not look like
guards at first glance, but they were. They reminded her of the
Aiel she had seen in the Stone of Tear; they probably looked like
wolves even when asleep. A bald, square-faced man, no taller than
she but nearly as wide as he was tall, trotted out of the Little
Tower and down the street, the hilt of the sword on his back
thrusting up over his shoulder. Even he&mdash;Jori, bonded to
Morvrin&mdash;managed it.</p>

<p>Top-knotted Uno passed, threading his horse through
the crowd and hardly seeming to acknowledge the heat despite the
steel plates and mail that covered him from the shoulders down. He
twisted in his saddle to watch her with his good eye, and her face
darkened. Birgitte <em>had</em> talked. Every time the man saw her
he was obviously waiting for her to ask him for horses. She was
almost ready to. Even Elayne could not say they were doing any
good. Well, she could, and did, but she should not.</p>

<p>Uno rode out of sight around a corner, and Nynaeve
sighed. She was just trying to put off going inside. Myrelle might
be there. Blotting her face again, she frowned at her wrinkled hand&mdash;today would be the eleventh scrubbing pots, with twenty-nine
more to go; twenty-nine!&mdash;and went in.</p>

<p>It was slightly cooler in what had been the common
room when the Little Tower was an inn, offering a little relief to
her aching head. Everyone called it &ldquo;the waiting room&rdquo; now. No time
had been wasted for repairs here. The fireplaces had stones
missing, and lathing showed through holes in the plaster. Areina
and Nicola were working brooms with another novice, but making
little impression on the age-roughened floor; Areina wore a scowl,
but, then, she was never pleased at having to do chores with the
novices. No one went choreless in Salidar. At the far end of the
room Romanda was speaking with two slender, aged Aes Sedai&mdash;their faces might be ageless, but their hair was white&mdash;plainly new arrivals by the thin dustcloaks still hanging down
their backs. No sign of Myrelle, which brought a sigh of relief;
the woman raked Nynaeve over the coals at every opportunity, then
raked her the other way! Aes Sedai sat at tables, mismatched but
carefully arranged in rows, working over parchments or issuing
orders to Warders and servants, but fewer than the first time she
had seen the room. Only the Sitters and their servants lived on the
floors above now; everyone else had been removed to make space for
Aes Sedai to work in. The Little Tower had taken on attributes of
the White Tower, the precise formality above all. When Nynaeve
first saw this room it had had a bustle about it, an air of
something being done. A false air, then. Now it seemed almost slow,
but it was the feel of the White Tower.</p>

<p>Approaching one of the tables not the nearest, she
curtsied carefully. &ldquo;Pardon, Aes Sedai, but I was told Siuan and
Leane are here. Could you tell me where to find them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brendas&rsquo; pen stopped moving and she looked up
with cool dark eyes. Nynaeve had chosen her instead of someone
nearer the door because Brendas was one of the few Aes Sedai who
had never grilled her about Rand. Besides, once, when Siuan was
Amyrlin, Siuan had chosen Brendas as one who could be trusted. That
had nothing to do with this, but Nynaeve found small comforts where
she could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are with some of the Sitters, child.&rdquo;
Brendas&rsquo; voice was chimes, as emotionless as her pale face.
Whites seldom showed emotion, but Brendas never showed any.</p>

<p>Nynaeve stifled an irritated sigh. If Sitters had
them reporting on their eyes-and-ears, they might not be free for
hours yet. Maybe not for the rest of the day. By then she would be
head-down among the pots. &ldquo;Thank you, Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brendas stopped her curtsy with a gesture. &ldquo;Did
Theodrin make any progress with you yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Aes Sedai.&rdquo; If her voice was bit tight, a touch
curt, she had reason. Theodrin had said she meant to try
everything, and apparently she really did mean everything.
Yesterday&rsquo;s effort had involved sipping wine to relax her,
only somehow Nynaeve had ended up taking more than just a few sips.
She did not think she would ever forget being carried back to her
room singing&mdash;singing!&mdash;or remember without going red
in the face. Brendas had to know. Everyone had to know. Nynaeve
wanted to writhe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only ask because your studies seem to be
suffering. I&rsquo;ve heard several sisters remark that you appear
to have reached the end of your remarkable discoveries. Your extra
chores might be the problem&mdash;but Elayne reveals something new
every day, even with teaching her classes and working at the pots.
A number of sisters are wondering whether they might not be able to
help you more than Theodrin can. If we took it in turns, working
you all day every day might prove more fruitful than these informal
sessions with someone who is, after all, little more than Accepted
herself.&rdquo; It was all delivered in a level tone without the
slightest accusation, yet Nynaeve&rsquo;s face heated as if she had
been shouted at.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Theodrin will find the key any day,
Aes Sedai,&rdquo; she almost whispered. &ldquo;I will try harder, Aes Sedai.&rdquo;
Bobbing a hurried curtsy, she whirled around before Brendas could
stop her again. With the result that she bumped into one of
the two white-haired newcomers. They looked enough alike to be
sisters in truth, almost mirror images of one another, with fine
bones and long patrician faces.</p>

<p>The bump was more of a brush, really, and she did try
to apologize, but the Aes Sedai fixed her with a stare to do a hawk
proud. &ldquo;Watch where you are going, Accepted. In my day, an Accepted
who tried to trample Aes Sedai would have had hair whiter than mine
by the time she finished scrubbing floors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other touched her arm. &ldquo;Oh, do let the child go,
Vandene. We have work to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vandene directed a sharp sniff at Nynaeve, but
allowed herself to be led outside.</p>

<p>Waiting a moment to let them leave, Nynaeve saw
Sheriam come out of one of the meeting rooms with Myrelle, Morvrin
and Beonin. Myrelle saw her, too, and started in her direction, but
only a step before Sheriam and Morvrin each put a hand on the Green
sister&rsquo;s arms and spoke quickly and softly, with many a glance
at Nynaeve. Still talking, the four crossed the room and
disappeared through another door.</p>

<p>Nynaeve waited until she was back in front of the
Little Tower before giving her braid a firm, deliberate tug. They
had met the Wise Ones last night. Guessing why the others had
stopped Myrelle from speaking was easy enough. If Egwene had
finally been there in the Heart of the Stone, she was not to be
told. Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara was in disgrace. Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara
was scrubbing pots like a novice when she might have been at least
a step higher than Accepted. Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara was getting
nowhere with Theodrin, and all her marvelous discoveries had dried
up. Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara would never be Aes Sedai. She had known
it was a mistake to start funneling everything from Moghedien
through Elayne. She had known it!</p>

<p>Her tongue tried to curl up at the memory of a vile
taste. Boiled catfern and powdered mavinsleaf. An antidote she had
used on many a child who would not stop lying. All right; she had
been the one to suggest it herself, but it was still a mistake. Aes
Sedai were no longer talking about her innovations; they talked
about the lack of them. Aes Sedai who had never taken more than a
passing interest in her block were now caught up in how to break it
down. She could not win. One way or another she was going to end up
with Aes Sedai examining her from hair to toenails, sunup to
sundown.</p>

<p>She yanked harder on her braid, hard enough to hurt
her scalp, and the way her head felt, that did nothing for her
temper. A soldier in an archer&rsquo;s flat helmet and padded jerkin
slowed to look at her curiously, but she gave him such a stare of
refined malevolence that he stumbled over his own feet and quickly
lost himself in the throng. <em>Why</em> did Elayne have to be so
stubborn?</p>

<p>A man&rsquo;s hands closed on her shoulders, and she
whirled about with words that would rip his head from his neck.
They died on her tongue.</p>

<p>Thom Merrilin grinned down at her through his long
white mustaches, sharp blue eyes twinkling in his gnarled face. &ldquo;By
the look of you, Nynaeve, I could almost think you were angry, but
I know you have such a sweet disposition people ask you to dabble
your fingers in their tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juilin Sandar was there beside him, the lean fellow
looking carved from dark wood, leaning on his thumb-thick bamboo
staff. Juilin was Tairen, not Taraboner, but he still wore that
ridiculous flat-topped conical red cap, even more battered than she
had last seen it. He snatched it off when she glanced at him. Both
men were dusty and travel-worn, their faces gaunt, though neither
had been particularly fleshy to begin with. They looked as if they
had spent the weeks since leaving Salidar sleeping in their clothes
when they were not in the saddle.</p>

<p>Before Nynaeve could open her mouth, they were hit by
a human storm. Elayne flung herself at Thom so hard he staggered.
He of course put his hands under her arms and hoisted her, whirling
her around in a circle like a child despite his slight limp. He was
laughing when he set her down again, and so was she. She reached up
and tugged at one of his mustaches, and they fell to laughing even
harder. He examined her hands, as wrinkled as Nynaeve&rsquo;s,
asking what sort of trouble she had dived into without him to keep
her on the straight and narrow, and she replied that she had no
need of anyone to tell her what to do, only she spoiled it by
blushing, and giggling, and biting her lip.</p>

<p>Nynaeve took a deep breath. Sometimes the pair of
them took playing at father and daughter entirely too far.
Sometimes Elayne seemed to think she was about ten, and so did
Thom. &ldquo;I thought you had a novice class this morning, Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other woman glanced at her sideways, then
gathered herself in an attempt at decorum that came too late, and
set about straightening her banded dress. &ldquo;I asked Calindin to take
it,&rdquo; she said casually. &ldquo;I thought I might keep you company. And
I&rsquo;m glad I did,&rdquo; she added with a grin for Thom. &ldquo;Now we can
hear everything you learned in Amadicia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve sniffed. Keep her company indeed. She did not
remember everything about yesterday, but she remembered Elayne
laughing while getting her undressed and putting her to bed with
the sun not yet all the way down. And she was sure she remembered
the woman asking whether she wanted a bucket of water to cool her
head.</p>

<p>Thom noticed nothing; most men were blind, though he
was sharp enough usually. &ldquo;We will have to be quick,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now
Sheriam&rsquo;s drained us dry, she means to have us report to some
of the Sitters in person. Luckily, it boils down well enough. There
aren&rsquo;t enough Whitecloaks along the Eldar to keep a mouse from
crossing, if he had drums and trumpets to announce him a day ahead.
Except for a strong force on the Tarabon border and the men he has
trying to hold back the Prophet in the north, Niall seems to be
gathering every last Whitecloak around Amadicia, and Ailron is
pulling in his soldiers, too. Talk of Salidar had started in the
streets before we left, but if Niall has even thought about the
place twice, I could find not a hint of it anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tarabon,&rdquo; Juilin muttered, studying his cap. &ldquo;All
ill country for anyone who doesn&rsquo;t know how to take care of
herself, or so we heard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve was not sure which of the two was best at
dissembling, but she was sure either could lie to your face to make
a wool merchant blue with envy. And right then, she was sure they
were hiding something.</p>

<p>Elayne saw more than that. Gripping Thom&rsquo;s
lapel, she peered up at him. &ldquo;You heard something about Mother,&rdquo;
she said calmly, and it was not a question.</p>

<p>Thom knuckled his mustaches. &ldquo;There are a hundred
rumors on every street in Amadicia, child, each wilder than the
last.&rdquo; His gnarled leathery face was pure innocence and openness,
but the man had not been innocent the day he was born. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
said the whole White Tower is here in Salidar, with ten thousand
Warders ready to cross the Eldar. It&rsquo;s said Aes Sedai have
captured Tanchico, and Rand has wings he uses to fly around in the
night, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thom?&rdquo; Elayne said.</p>

<p>He snorted, glaring at Juilin and Nynaeve as though
this were their fault. &ldquo;Child, it&rsquo;s just a rumor, as crazed as
any we heard. I could not confirm anything, and believe me, I
tried. I meant not to mention it. It just stirs up your pain. Let
it pass, child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thom.&rdquo; Much firmer. Shifting his feet, Juilin looked
as if he wished he were somewhere else. Thom just looked grim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you must hear it. Everybody in Amadicia
seems to think your mother is in the Fortress of the Light, that
she&rsquo;s going to lead an army of Whitecloaks back to Andor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne shook her head, laughing softly. &ldquo;Oh, Thom, do
you think I would worry over something like that? Mother would
never go to the Whitecloaks. I could wish she had. I could wish she
was alive to. Even though it violates everything she ever taught me&mdash;bringing foreign soldiers into Andor; and Whitecloaks!&mdash;I could wish it. But if wishes were wings&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Her smile
was sad, but it was a muted sadness. &ldquo;I have done my grieving,
Thom. Mother is dead, and I must do my best to be worthy of her.
She would never have gone running after ridiculous rumors, or wept
over them either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Child,&rdquo; he said awkwardly.</p>

<p>Nynaeve wondered what if anything he himself felt
about Morgase&rsquo;s death. Hard as it was to believe, he had been
Morgase&rsquo;s lover once, when she was young and Elayne little
more than a babe. Back then he must not have looked as though he
had been left to dry in the sun too long. Nynaeve knew little more
of how or why it ended than that he had slipped out of Caemlyn with
an arrest warrant at his heels. Not the mark of a love to be told
in the stories. At the moment he certainly appeared concerned only
with whether Elayne was telling the truth or hiding her hurt, with
patting her shoulder and stroking her hair. If Nynaeve had not
wished they would just once snap at one another like normal people,
she would have thought it a pretty picture.</p>

<p>A throat clearing broke up the vignette. &ldquo;Master
Merrilin?&rdquo; Tabitha said, spreading her white dress in a quick
curtsy. &ldquo;Master Sandar? Sheriam Sedai says the Sitters are ready to
receive you. She says you were not supposed to leave the Little
Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Little Tower, is it?&rdquo; Thom said dryly, eyeing
the former inn. &ldquo;Elayne, they can&rsquo;t keep us forever. When
we&rsquo;re done, you and I can discuss&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;whatever you wish.&rdquo;
Motioning Tabitha to lead, he marched inside, his limp obvious, the
way it was when he was tired. Juilin squared his shoulders and
followed as though walking to a gallows; he was Tairen, after
all.</p>

<p>Nynaeve and Elayne stood there, neither quite looking
at the other.</p>

<p>Finally, Nynaeve said, &ldquo;I was not&mdash;&rdquo; at the
same time that Elayne said, &ldquo;I should not&mdash;&rdquo; They cut off
together, and moments passed in fidgeting with skirts and blotting
faces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is too hot to just stand here,&rdquo; Nynaeve said at
last.</p>

<p>It was unlikely that the Sitters who were hearing
Siuan and Leane&rsquo;s reports would stop to hear Thom and
Juilin&rsquo;s. They split such things among them. That left Logain,
much as she wished it did not. She would not learn anything. But it
was better than twiddling her thumbs until a dozen Aes Sedai
descended on her with an hourly schedule.</p>

<p>With a sigh she started down the street. Elayne came
along as though she had been invited. That helped Nynaeve find the
anger she was going to need. Abruptly she realized that
Elayne&rsquo;s wrists were bare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the bracelet?&rdquo; she asked softly. No one in
the street would understand if they heard, but caution once
forgotten could be forgotten once too often. &ldquo;Where is
Marigan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bracelet is in my pouch, Nynaeve.&rdquo; Elayne
stepped aside to let a high-wheeled cart pass, then joined Nynaeve
again behind the cart. &ldquo;Marigan is doing our laundry, with about
twenty other women around her. And groaning every time she moves.
She said something she didn&rsquo;t think Birgitte would hear, and
Birgitte&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I <em>had</em> to take the thing off, Nynaeve.
Birgitte had the right, and it <em>hurt</em>. I told Marigan to say
she fell down some stairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve sniffed, but her heart was not in it. She had
not been wearing the bracelet much of late. Not because she could
not hand over anything she dug out as her own. She was still sure
Moghedien knew <em>something</em> about Healing even if she did not
realize it herself&mdash;nobody could be that blind&mdash;and
there was the trick of detecting a man&rsquo;s channeling that
Moghedien kept saying they almost had right. The truth of it was,
she was afraid she might do far worse than Birgitte had if she had
any more contact with the woman than was absolutely necessary.
Maybe it was the way satisfaction seemed to underlie everything
else even when Moghedien was groaning from the fed-back pain of
Nynaeve trying to master that detection. Maybe it was remembering
how afraid she had been, alone with the woman without the bracelet.
Maybe growing disgust at keeping one of the Forsaken from judgment.
Maybe some of all of it. What she did know was that she had to make
herself put on the bracelet now, and that whenever she saw
Moghedien&rsquo;s face, she wanted to pound it with her fists.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should not have laughed,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;I am sorry
I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve stopped dead so suddenly that a horseman had
to jerk his reins to keep from riding over her. He shouted
something before the crowd carried him away, but shock muffled his
words beyond hearing. Not shock at the apology. At what she had to
say. The right thing to say. The truth.</p>

<p>Unable to look at Elayne, she started walking again.
 &ldquo;You had every right to laugh. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She swallowed hard. &ldquo;I
made a complete fool of myself.&rdquo; She had. A few sips, Theodrin
said; a cup. And she emptied the pitcher. If you were going to
fail, better to have some other reason than that you just could not
do it. &ldquo;You should have sent for that bucket and dunked my head
until I could recite <em>The Great Hunt of the Horn</em> without a
mistake.&rdquo; She risked a glance from the corner of her eye. Small
spots of color rested in Elayne&rsquo;s cheeks. So there had been
mention of a bucket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It could happen to anyone,&rdquo; the other woman said
simply.</p>

<p>Nynaeve felt her own cheeks heating. When it had
happened to Elayne, she had dunked the girl to wash away the wine.
 &ldquo;You should have done whatever you needed to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to sober
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was quite the oddest argument Nynaeve could
remember, with her insisting she had been a total fool and deserved
whatever came of it, while Elayne made excuse after excuse for her.
Nynaeve did not understand why it felt so refreshing, taking all
the blame on herself that way. She could not recall ever doing that
before, not without hedging as far as she was able. She very nearly
got angry with Elayne for not agreeing that she had been a childish
buffoon. It lasted until they reached the small thatched house on
the edge of the village where Logain was kept.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t stop this,&rdquo; Elayne said finally,
 &ldquo;I vow I&rsquo;ll send for a bucket of water right this
instant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve opened her mouth, then closed it again. Even
in this newfound euphoria of admitting she had been wrong, that was
going too far. Feeling this good, she could not face Logain.
Feeling this good, it would be useless anyway, without Moghedien
and the bracelet she definitely felt too fine to put on. She
glanced at the two Warders standing guard beside the stone-linteled
door. They were not close enough to hear, but she still pitched her
voice low. &ldquo;Elayne, let&rsquo;s go. Tonight.&rdquo; With Thom and Juilin
in Salidar, there was no need to ask Uno to find horses. &ldquo;Not to
Caemlyn, if you don&rsquo;t want. To Ebou Dar. Merilille will never
find that bowl, and Sheriam will never let us go find it. What do
you say? Tonight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Nynaeve. What good can we do Rand if they take
us for runaways? Which is what we&rsquo;d be. You promised, Nynaeve.
You promised, if we found something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promised if we found something we could use. All
we&rsquo;ve found is this!&rdquo; Nynaeve thrust her shriveled hands under
the other woman&rsquo;s nose.</p>

<p>The firmness slid from Elayne&rsquo;s face, and her
voice; she pursed her lips and studied the ground. &ldquo;Nynaeve, you
know I told Birgitte we were staying. Well, it seems she told Uno
that under no circumstances was he to provide you with a horse
unless she said so. She told him you were thinking of running away.
I didn&rsquo;t find out until it was too late.&rdquo; Her head tossed
irritably. &ldquo;If this is what having a Warder is like, I don&rsquo;t
know why anybody wants one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve thought her eyes might burst from
indignation. So that was why he had been staring at her. Euphoria
vanished in a heat of&mdash;well, partly anger, partly
humiliation. The man knew, he thought she&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;wait. For a moment
she frowned at Elayne, then decided not to voice the question that
had come to mind. Was Nynaeve the only name Birgitte had mentioned
to Uno, or was Elayne perhaps included? Elayne had found herself
quite an adopted family. In Thom, an indulgent father who wanted to
teach her everything he knew, and in Birgitte, an older sister who
thought it was her job to keep the younger from breaking her neck
riding horses she could not handle yet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; she said flatly, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s see what
I can learn from Logain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a small house, only two rooms, but thick stone
walls made it relatively cool. Logain was in his shirtsleeves,
smoking a pipe and reading by a window. The Aes Sedai were taking
good care of him. The chairs and tables were as fine as anything in
Salidar&mdash;nothing elaborate, but well made, though nothing
matched anything else&mdash;and a scroll-woven red-and-gold carpet
covered much of a floor that was swept so clean Nynaeve doubted he
did the sweeping.</p>

<p>He set his book down when they entered, seemingly not
at all put out by the lack of a knock. Rising leisurely, he tapped
out his pipe, donned his coat and only then made a smooth leg. &ldquo;It
is good to see you again after so long. I thought you had forgotten
me. Will you join me in some wine? The Aes Sedai keep me on short
supply, but what they do let me have is not bad at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The offer of wine would have been enough&mdash;Nynaeve barely suppressed a wince&mdash;if she had needed more.
Thinking of Uno, the fact that he was male was enough. No need to
pull up any of her anger from the Little Tower. Thinking of it
added its bit, though. The True Source was suddenly there, an
unseen warmth just out of sight. She opened herself, and <em>
saidar</em> flooded her; if what she had felt earlier was euphoria,
this was beyond ecstasy. She <em>was</em> surrendering to it, burn
Theodrin!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; she told him coldly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have no
chatter out of you. Answer when you&rsquo;re spoken to, and
otherwise hold your tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Logain only shrugged and complied, meek as a puppy.
No, not meek; that smile was pure insolence. Part came from his
feelings toward Aes Sedai, Nynaeve was certain, and part&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;he
watched Elayne take another chair, arranging her skirts with a
studied care, and even if Nynaeve had not seen what he was looking
at, she would have known it was a woman. There was no smirking
about it, no leering, just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Nynaeve did not know what, only
that he directed the same at her, and she was suddenly very much
aware that she was a woman and he a man. Maybe it was just that he
was handsome and had broad shoulders, but she liked to think
better of herself. Of course that was not it.</p>

<p>Clearing her throat, she wove filaments of <em>
saidar</em> into him, Air and Water, Fire and Earth, Spirit. All
the elements of Healing, but used now to probe. It would have
helped to lay her hands on him, but she could not bring herself to
do that. Bad enough to touch him with the Power. He was healthy as
a bull and almost as strong, nothing wrong with him in the
slightest&mdash;except for the hole.</p>

<p>It was not really a hole, more a feeling that what
seemed continuous was not, that what seemed smooth and straight was
really skirting around an absence. She knew that sensation well,
from the early days, back when she thought she might really learn
something. It still made her skin crawl.</p>

<p>He looked up at her intently. She did not remember
moving closer. His face was fixed in a mask of brazen contempt; she
might not be Aes Sedai, but she was the next thing to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you do all of that at once?&rdquo; Elayne asked.
 &ldquo;I could not keep track of half of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; Nynaeve murmured. Hiding the effort required,
she took Logain&rsquo;s head in her hands roughly. Yes. It was
better with physical contact, the impressions sharper.</p>

<p>She directed the full flow of <em>saidar</em> into
where the hole should have been&mdash;and was almost surprised to
find an emptiness. Of course, she still did not expect to learn
anything. Men were as different from women in the Power as they
were in flesh, maybe more so. She might as well study a rock to
find out about fish. It was hard to keep her thoughts on what she
was doing, knowing she was only going through motions, killing time
as it were.</p>

<p><em>What is Myrelle going to say? Would she keep back
a message from Egwene?</em> That emptiness, so small she could pass
right over it, was vast once she slipped the flows inside, immense
enough to swallow them all. <em>If only I could talk to Egwene.
I&rsquo;ll wager once she knows the Tower is sending an embassy to
Rand, and the Aes Sedai here are just sitting on their hands,
she&rsquo;ll help me convince Elayne we&rsquo;ve done all we can
here</em>. Vast emptiness; nothingness. What about what she had
found in Siuan and Leane, the feel of something cut? She was sure
it was real, however faint. Men and women might be different, but
maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>All I need to do is talk to her somehow.
She&rsquo;ll see that Rand would be better off with us there. Elayne
will listen to her; Elayne thinks Egwene knows Rand better than
anybody else</em>. There it was. Something cut. Just an impression,
but the same as in Siuan and Leane. <em>So how do I find her? If
only she&rsquo;d pop into our dreams again. I&rsquo;ll bet I can talk
her into joining us. The three of us would do much better with
Rand. Together, we could tell him what we learn in</em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod<em>, keep him from making some wool-headed
mistake with the Aes Sedai. She&rsquo;ll see that</em>. Something
about that cut&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;if it was bridged with Fire and Spirit, so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was the slight widening of Logain&rsquo;s eyes that
told her what she had done. Breath froze in her throat. She backed
away from him so fast she stumbled over her skirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve,&rdquo; Elayne said, sitting up straight, &ldquo;what is
the mat&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A heartbeat, and Nynaeve had all of <em>saidar</em>
she could hold redirected into a shield. &ldquo;Go find Sheriam,&rdquo; she
said hurriedly. &ldquo;Nobody else but Sheriam. Tell her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She drew
a deep breath that seemed like her first in hours; her heart was
speeding to beat galloping horses. &ldquo;Tell her I&rsquo;ve Healed
Logain.&rdquo;</p>
