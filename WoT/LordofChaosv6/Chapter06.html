Sammael stepped onto flowery silk carpets,
leaving the gateway open in case he needed to retreat and holding
hard to <em>saidin</em>. Usually he refused meetings except on
neutral ground, or his own, but this was the second time he had
come here. A matter of necessity. He had never been a trusting man,
and was less so since hearing bits of what had passed between
Demandred and the three women, and Graendal certainly had told him
only enough to support some gain she saw for herself. He quite
understood; he had plans of his own the other Chosen knew nothing
about. There would only be one Nae&rsquo;blis, and that was a prize
worth as much as immortality itself.</p>

<p>He stood on a deep dais, marble-railed at one end,
where tables and chairs of gilded work and carved ivory, some quite
disgusting in their details, were arranged to command the rest of
the long, columned hall, ten feet below. No stairs led down there;
it was a huge, extravagant pit in which to present entertainment.
Sunlight sparkled through tall windows where colored glass made
elaborate patterns. None of the sun&rsquo;s blistering heat
penetrated; the air was cool, though he felt it only remotely.
Graendal had no more need than he to make such an effort, but of
course she would. The wonder was that she had not extended the net
to the entire palace.</p>

<p>There was something different in the lower part of
the chamber since his last visit, but he could not see what. Three
long wading pools ran down the center of the hall, each with a
fountain&mdash;sleek forms, motion frozen in stone&mdash;that
sent water almost to the carved marble ribs of the arched ceiling
overhead. Men and women sported in the pools wearing scraps of silk
or less, while others garbed in little more performed along the
sides, acrobats and jugglers, dancers in varied styles and
musicians playing flutes and horns, drums and all sorts of stringed
instruments. Of every size, every shade of skin and hair and eyes,
each was more physically perfect than the last. It was all meant to
amuse whoever stood on the dais. It was idiocy. A waste of time and
energy. Typical of Graendal.</p>

<p>The dais had been empty except for himself when he
stepped onto it, but with <em>saidin</em> filling him, he smelled
Graendal&rsquo;s sweet perfume, like an air from a garden of
flowers, and heard her slippers whispering on the carpets well
before she spoke behind him. &ldquo;Are my pets not beautiful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She joined him at the railing, smiling at the display
below. Her thin blue Domani gown clung and more than hinted. As
usual she had a ring with different stones on every finger, four or
five gem-encrusted bracelets on each wrist, and a wide collar of
huge sapphires snugged around the gown&rsquo;s high neck. He did not
know about such things, but he suspected hours had gone into
arranging those sun-gold curls touching her shoulders, and the
moondrops seemingly scattered through them; there was something
about their casualness that hinted at precision.</p>

<p>Sammael sometimes wondered about her. He had never
met her until he chose to abandon a losing cause and follow the
Great Lord, but everyone knew of her, famous and honored, a
dedicated ascetic, treating those with disturbed minds Healing
could not touch. At that first meeting, when she accepted his
initial pledges to the Great Lord, every trace of the abstemious
benefactor was gone, as if she had deliberately become the opposite
of everything she had been before. On the surface her total
fixation was her own pleasure, nearly obscuring a desire to pull
down everyone who had a particle of power. And that in turn almost
hid her own thirst for power, very seldom exercised openly.
Graendal had always been very good at hiding things in plain sight.
He thought he knew her better than any of the other Chosen did&mdash;she had accompanied him to Shayol Ghul to make his obeisance&mdash;but even he did not know all the layers of her. She had as
many shades as a <em>jegal</em> had scales, slipping from one to
another as quickly as lightning. She had been the mistress then, he
the acolyte, for all his accomplishments as a general. That
situation had changed.</p>

<p>None of the waders or performers looked up, but with
her appearance they became more energetic, more graceful if that
was possible, attempting to display themselves to best advantage;
they existed to please her. Graendal made sure of that.</p>

<p>She gestured to four acrobats, a dark-haired man
supporting three slim women, coppery skins oiled and gleaming.
 &ldquo;They are my favorites, I think. Ramsid is the Domani king&rsquo;s
brother. The woman standing on his shoulders is Ramsid&rsquo;s wife;
the other two are the king&rsquo;s youngest sister and eldest
daughter. Don&rsquo;t you find it remarkable what can be learned
with the proper encouragement? Consider all the talents going to
waste.&rdquo; That was one of her favorite concepts. A place for everyone
and everyone in their place, chosen for them according to their
talents and the needs of society. Which needs always seemed to
center on her own desires. The whole thing bored Sammael; had her
precepts been applied to him, he would still stand where he
was.</p>

<p>The male acrobat turned slowly to give them a good
view; he held a woman straight-armed to either side while they hung
by one hand from the grip of the one on his shoulders. Graendal had
already moved on, to a very dark-skinned man and woman with curly
hair, both of great beauty. A slender pair played oddly elongated
harps, with chimes that resonated to the plucked strings in
crystalline echoes. &ldquo;My newest acquisitions, from the lands beyond
the Aiel Waste. They should thank me for rescuing them. Chiape was
Sh&rsquo;boan, a sort of empress, newly widowed, and Shaofan was to
marry her and become Sh&rsquo;botay. For seven years she would have
ruled absolutely, then died. Whereupon he would have chosen a new
Sh&rsquo;boan and ruled absolutely until his death in seven years.
They have followed that cycle for nearly three thousand years
without a break.&rdquo; She gave a small laugh and shook her head
wonderingly. &ldquo;Shaofan and Chiape insist the deaths are natural. The
Will of the Pattern, they call it. To them everything is the Will
of the Pattern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sammael kept his eyes on the people below. Graendal
prattled like a fool, but only a true fool took her for one. What
she seemed to let slip among her babbling was often planted as
carefully as a <em>conje</em> needle. The key was picking out why,
and what she meant to gain. Why would she suddenly have snatched
pets from so far away? She seldom went out of her way. Was she
trying to divert him toward the lands beyond the Waste by making
him think she had an interest there? The battlefield was here. The
Great Lord&rsquo;s first touch when he broke free would land here.
The rest of the world would be whipped by the fringes of storms,
even racked by storms, but those storms would generate here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since so much of the Domani king&rsquo;s family met
with your approval,&rdquo; he said dryly, &ldquo;I am surprised no more did.&rdquo;
If she wanted to divert him, she would find a way to slide it in
again. She never thought anyone knew her tricks well enough to see
through them.</p>

<p>A lithe dark-haired woman, not young but with the
sort of pale beauty and elegance that would last all her life,
appeared at his elbow cradling a crystal goblet of dark wine punch
in both hands. He took it, though he had no intention of drinking;
beginners watched for a major assault till their eyes burned, and
let a lone assassin walk up behind them. Alliances, however
temporary, were all very well, but the fewer of the Chosen who
remained on the Day of Return, the greater the chance among the
survivors to be named Nae&rsquo;blis. The Great Lord had always
encouraged such&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;competition; only the fittest were worthy to
serve. At times Sammael behaved that the one chosen to rule the
world forever would be the last of the Chosen left standing.</p>

<p>The woman turned back to a muscular young man who
held a golden tray with another goblet and a tall matching
pitcher. Both wore diaphanous white robes, and neither gave so much
as the flicker of an eye to the gateway, opening into his
apartments in Illian. When she served Graendal, the woman&rsquo;s
face was a portrait of worship. There was never any trouble about
speaking in front of her servants and pets, though they would not
number a single Friend of the Dark among them. She distrusted
Friends of the Dark, claiming they were too easily swayed, but the
level of Compulsion used on those who served her personally left
little room for anything beyond adoration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I almost expect to see the king himself here serving
wine,&rdquo; he continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I choose only the most exquisite. Alsalam
is not up to my standard.&rdquo; Graendal took the wine from the woman
with barely a glance, and not for the first time Sammael wondered
whether the pets were another screen, like the chattering. A little
prodding might shake something loose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sooner or later you will slip, Graendal. One of your
visitors will recognize one who serves him wine or turns down his
bed, and he will have sense enough to hold his tongue until he
leaves. What will you do if someone descends on this palace with an
army to rescue a husband or a sister? An arrow may not be a
shocklance, yet it can still kill you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She threw back her head and laughed, a trill of gay
amusement, plainly too silly to see the implied insult. Plainly, as
long as you did not know her. &ldquo;Oh, Sammael, why would I let them
see anything but what I want them to? I certainly do not send my
pets to serve them. Alsalam&rsquo;s supporters and his opponents,
even the Dragonsworn, leave here thinking I support them and only
them. And they do not want to disturb an invalid.&rdquo; His skin tingled
slightly as she channeled, and for an instant her image changed.
Her skin became coppery but dull, her hair and eyes dark but flat;
she appeared gaunt and frail, a once-beautiful Domani woman slowly
losing a battle against illness. He barely stopped his lip from
curling. One touch would prove the angular contours of that face
were not hers&mdash;only the most subtle use of Illusion could
pass that test&mdash;but Graendal seemed wedded to flamboyance.
The next moment she was herself again, wearing a wry smile. &ldquo;You
would not believe how they all trust and listen to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It never ceased to amaze him that she chose to remain
here in a palace well known across Arad Doman, with civil war and
anarchy all around her. Of course, he did not think she had let any
others of the Chosen know where she had established herself. That
she trusted him with the knowledge made him wary. She liked her
comforts, and never wanted to expend much effort to keep them, yet
this palace was in sight of the Mountains of Mist, and considerable
work was necessary to keep the turmoil away from her, to keep
anyone from asking where the former owner had gone, along with his
family and servants. Sammael would not be surprised if every Domani
who visited here left believing that this land had been handed down
in her family since the Breaking. She used Compulsion so often like
a hammer that one might forget that she could wield the weaker
forms of it with great delicacy, twisting a mind&rsquo;s path so
subtly that even the closest examination might miss every trace of
her. In fact, she might have been the best at that who ever
lived.</p>

<p>He let the gateway vanish but held on to <em>
saidin</em>; those tricks did not work on someone wrapped in the
Source. And in truth, he enjoyed the struggle for survival, though
it was unconscious now; only the strongest deserved to survive, and
he proved his own fitness to himself every day in that battle.
There was no way she could know he still grasped <em>saidin</em>,
but she smiled briefly into her goblet as if she did. He liked
people pretending to know things almost as little as he liked them
knowing things he did not. &ldquo;What do you have to tell me?&rdquo; he said,
more roughly than he intended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About Lews Therin? You never seem interested in
anything else. Now, he would be a pet. I would make him the
centerpiece of every display. Not that he is handsome enough,
normally, but who he is makes up for that.&rdquo; Smiling into her goblet
again, she added in a murmur that would have been inaudible without
<em>saidin</em> in him, &ldquo;And I do like them tall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was an effort not to stand up as straight as he
could. He was not short, but it rankled that his height did not
match his ability. Lews Therin had been a head taller than he; so
was al&rsquo;Thor. There was always an assumption that the taller
man was the better. It took another effort not to touch the scar
that slanted across his face from hairline to square-cut beard.
Lews Therin had given him that; he kept it for a reminder. He
suspected she had misunderstood his question on purpose, to bait
him. &ldquo;Lews Therin is long dead,&rdquo; he said harshly. &ldquo;Rand
al&rsquo;Thor is a jumped-up farmboy, a <em>choss</em>-hauler who
has been lucky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graendal blinked at him as if surprised. &ldquo;Do you
really think so? There has to be more than luck behind him. Luck
could not have carried him so far, so fast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sammael had not come to talk about al&rsquo;Thor, yet
ice formed at the base of his spine. Thoughts he had forced himself
to dismiss came oozing back. Al&rsquo;Thor was not Lews Therin, but
al&rsquo;Thor was Lews Therin&rsquo;s soul reborn, as Lews Therin
himself had been the rebirth of that soul. Sammael was neither
philosopher nor theologian, yet Ishamael had been both, and he
claimed to have divined secrets hidden in that fact. Ishamael had
died mad, true, but even when he was still sane, back when it
seemed they surely would drive Lews Therin Telamon to defeat, he
claimed this struggle had gone on since the Creation, an endless
war between the Great Lord and the Creator using human surrogates.
More, he avowed that the Great Lord would almost as soon have
turned Lews Therin to the Shadow as have broken free. Maybe
Ishamael had been a little mad then, too, but there had been
efforts to turn Lews Therin. And Ishamael said that it had happened
in the past, the Creator&rsquo;s champion made a creature of the
Shadow and raised up as the Shadow&rsquo;s champion.</p>

<p>There were unsettling implications in those claims,
ramifications Sammael did not want to consider, but the thing that
shoved itself to the front of his mind was the possibility that the
Great Lord might really want to make al&rsquo;Thor Nae&rsquo;blis. It
could not happen in a vacuum. Al&rsquo;Thor would need help. Help&mdash;that could explain his supposed luck so far. &ldquo;Have you
learned where al&rsquo;Thor is hiding Asmodean? Or anything of
Lanfear&rsquo;s whereabouts? Or Moghedien&rsquo;s?&rdquo; Of course,
Moghedien always hid herself; the Spider was forever popping up
just when you were sure she was finally dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know as much as I do,&rdquo; Graendal said blithely,
pausing for a sip from her goblet. &ldquo;Myself, I think Lews Therin
killed them. Oh, don&rsquo;t grimace at me. Al&rsquo;Thor, since you
insist.&rdquo; The thought did not seem to disturb her, but then, she
would never find herself in open conflict with al&rsquo;Thor. That
had never been her way. If al&rsquo;Thor ever discovered her, she
simply would abandon everything and re-establish herself elsewhere&mdash;or else surrender before he could strike a blow, then begin
convincing him that she was indispensable. &ldquo;There are rumors out of
Cairhien about Lanfear dying at Lews Therin&rsquo;s hands the same
day he killed Rahvin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rumors! Lanfear has been aiding al&rsquo;Thor since
the beginning, if you ask me. I would have had his head in the
Stone of Tear except that someone sent Myrddraal and Trollocs to
save him! That was Lanfear; I am certain. I&rsquo;m done with her.
The next time I see her, I&rsquo;ll kill her! And why would he kill
Asmodean? I would if I could find him, but he has gone over to
al&rsquo;Thor. He&rsquo;s teaching him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always some excuse for your failures,&rdquo; she whispered
into her punch, again too softly for him to have heard without <em>
saidin</em>. In a louder voice, she said, &ldquo;Choose your own
explanations, if you wish. You may even be right. All I know is
that Lews Therin seems to be removing us from the game one by
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sammael&rsquo;s hand trembled with anger, nearly
slopping punch from his goblet before he could still it. Rand
al&rsquo;Thor was not Lews Therin. He himself had outlived the great
Lews Therin Telamon, handing out praise for victories he could not
have won himself and expecting others to lap it up. His only regret
was that the man had not left a grave for him to spit on.</p>

<p>Waving ringed fingers in time to a snatch of music
from below, Graendal spoke absently, as though her real attention
was on the tune. &ldquo;So many of us have died confronting him. Aginor
and Balthamel. Ishamael, Be&rsquo;lal and Rahvin. And Lanfear and
Asmodean, whatever you believe. Possibly Moghedien; she might be
creeping about in the shadows waiting until the rest of us have
fallen&mdash;she&rsquo;s foolish enough. I do hope you have
somewhere prepared to run. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any doubt
that he is going after you next. Soon, I would say. I&rsquo;ll face
no armies here, but Lews Therin is gathering quite a large one to
hurl against you. The price you pay if you must be <em>seen</em> to
wield power as well as wield it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did have lines of retreat prepared, as it happened&mdash;that was only prudent&mdash;but hearing in her voice the
certainty of his need infuriated him. &ldquo;And if I destroy <em>
al&rsquo;Thor</em> then, it will violate none of the Great
Lord&rsquo;s command.&rdquo; He did not understand, but there was no
requirement to understand the Great Lord, only to obey. &ldquo;As far as
you&rsquo;ve told it to me. If you have held back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graendal&rsquo;s eyes hardened to blue ice. She might
avoid confrontation, but she did not like threats. The next instant
she was all inane smiles again. As changeable as the weather in
M&rsquo;jinn. &ldquo;What Demandred told me that the Great Lord told him,
I have passed on to you, Sammael. Every word. I doubt even he would
dare lie in the Great Lord&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve told me little enough of what he
plans to do,&rdquo; Sammael said softly, &ldquo;him or Semirhage or Mesaana.
Practically nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have told you what I know.&rdquo; She sighed irritably.
Perhaps she was telling the truth. She seemed to regret not knowing
herself. Perhaps. With her, anything and everything could be show.
 &ldquo;For the rest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;think back, Sammael. We used to plot against
one another almost as hard as we fought Lews Therin, yet we were
winning before he caught us all gathered at Shayol Ghul.&rdquo; She
shuddered, and for a moment her face looked haggard. Sammael did
not want to remember that day either, or what came after, a
dreamless sleep while the world changed past recognition and all he
had wrought vanished. &ldquo;Now we have awakened in a world where we
should stand so far above ordinary mortals as to be another species&mdash;and we are dying. For a moment forget who will be
Nae&rsquo;blis. Al&rsquo;Thor&mdash;if you must call him by that
name&mdash;al&rsquo;Thor was as helpless as a babe when we
woke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ishamael did not find him so,&rdquo; he said&mdash;of
course, Ishamael <em>had</em> been mad then&mdash;but she
continued as if he had not spoken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We behave as if this is the world we knew, when
nothing is what we knew. We die one by one, and al&rsquo;Thor grows
stronger. Lands and people gather behind him. And we die.
Immortality is mine. I do not want to die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he frightens you, then kill him.&rdquo; Before the
words were well out of his mouth he would have swallowed them if he
could.</p>

<p>Disbelief and scorn twisted Graendal&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I
serve the Great Lord and obey, Sammael.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As do I. As well as any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So good of you to deign to kneel to our Master.&rdquo; Her
voice was as wintry as her smile, and his face darkened. &ldquo;All I say
is that Lews Therin is as dangerous now as he ever was in our own
time. Frightened? Yes, I am frightened. I intend to live forever,
not meet Rahvin&rsquo;s fate!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Tsag!</em>&rdquo; The obscenity at least made her
blink and truly look at him. &ldquo;Al&rsquo;Thor&mdash;al&rsquo;Thor,
Graendal! An ignorant boy, whatever Asmodean manages to teach him!
A primitive lout who probably still believes that nine-tenths of
what you and I take for granted is impossible! Al&rsquo;Thor makes a
few lords bow and thinks he has conquered a nation. He hasn&rsquo;t
the will to close his fist and truly conquer them. Only the Aiel&mdash;<em>Bajad drovja!</em> Who would have thought they could
change so?&rdquo;&mdash;he had to get a grip on himself; he never cursed
like this; it was a weakness&mdash;&ldquo;only they truly follow him,
and not all of them. He hangs by a thread, and he will fall, one
way or another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will he? What if he is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; She stopped, raising
her goblet so rapidly that punch spilled onto her wrist, and gulped
until the goblet was almost empty. The elegant serving woman came
scurrying with the crystal pitcher. Graendal thrust out the goblet
to be refilled and went on breathlessly. &ldquo;How many of us will die
before it is done? We must stand together as we never have
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was not what she had started to say. He ignored
the ice that gripped his spine once more. Al&rsquo;Thor would not be
chosen Nae&rsquo;blis. He would not! So she wanted them to stand
together, did she? &ldquo;Then link with me. The pair of us linked would
be more than a match for al&rsquo;Thor. Let that be the beginning of
our new standing together.&rdquo; His scar tightened as he smiled at the
sudden blankness on her face. The link had to come from her, but
with only the two of them, she would have to give him control and
trust him to choose when to end it. &ldquo;So. It seems we will go on as
before.&rdquo; There had never been any question of it, really; trust was
no part of any of them. &ldquo;What more do you have to tell me?&rdquo; That
was the reason he had come here, not to listen to her rattle on
about Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Al&rsquo;Thor would be dealt with. Directly
or indirectly.</p>

<p>She stared at him, gathering herself, eyes glittering
with enmity. Finally she said, &ldquo;Little enough.&rdquo; She would not
forget that he had seen her lose control. None of her anger came
out in her voice; her tone was smooth, even offhand. &ldquo;Semirhage
missed the last gathering; I don&rsquo;t know why, and I do not
think Mesaana or Demandred does either. Mesaana in particular was
annoyed, though she tried to hide it. She thinks Lews Therin soon
will be in our hands, but then she has said the same every time.
She was sure Be&rsquo;lal would kill or capture him in Tear; she was
very proud of that trap. Demandred warns you to be careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So Demandred knows you and I meet,&rdquo; he said flatly.
Why had he ever expected to receive more than driblets from
her?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he does. Not how much I tell you, but that
I tell you something. I am trying to bring us together, Sammael,
before it is too&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He cut in sharply. &ldquo;You deliver a message to
Demandred from me. Tell him I know what he is up to.&rdquo; Events to the
south had Demandred&rsquo;s mark all over them. Demandred had always
liked using proxies. &ldquo;Tell <em>him</em> to be careful. I won&rsquo;t have him
or his <em>friends</em> interfering in my plans.&rdquo; Perhaps he could direct
al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s attention there; that would likely put an end
to him. If other means did not work. &ldquo;So long as they steer clear
of me, his lackeys can carve out what he wants, but they will steer
clear or he will answer for it.&rdquo; There had been a long struggle
after the Bore was opened into the Great Lord&rsquo;s prison, many
years before enough strength was gathered to move openly. This
time, when the final seal was shattered, he would present the Great
Lord with nations ready to follow. If they did not know who they
followed, what did that matter? He would not fail, as Be&rsquo;lal
and Rahvin had. The Great Lord would see who served him best. &ldquo;You
tell him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you wish it,&rdquo; she said, grimacing reluctantly. An
instant later that lazy smile came onto her face again. Changeable.
 &ldquo;All these threats weary me. Come. Listen to the music and calm
yourself.&rdquo; He started to tell her he had no interest in music, as
she knew very well, but she turned to the marble railing. &ldquo;There
they are. Listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The very dark man and woman had come to the foot of
the dais with their peculiar harps. Sammael supposed the chimes
added something to their playing; what, he could not say. They
beamed reverently up at Graendal when they saw her watching.
Despite her own advice to listen, Graendal went on talking. &ldquo;A
peculiar place they come from. Women who can channel are required
to marry the sons of women who can channel, and everyone of those
bloodlines is marked with tattoos on their faces at birth. No one
with the markings is allowed to marry anyone without; any child of
such a union is killed. Tattooed males are killed in their
twenty-first year in any case, and cloistered before, ignorant even
of how to read.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she had come back to it after all. She truly must
think he was simple. He decided to plant a small barb of his own.
 &ldquo;Do they bind themselves like criminals?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A look of puzzlement flashed across her face and was
hastily suppressed. Plainly she had not reasoned it out; there was
no reason she should. Few people in their time had ever committed
one violent crime, let alone more. Before the Bore, at least. She
did not admit her ignorance, of course. There were times when it
was best to hide lack of knowledge, but Graendal often carried the
practice to a fault. That was why he had mentioned it; he knew it
would dig at her, and serve her right for the useless shreds she
doled out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said as if she had understood. &ldquo;The Ayyad,
as they call themselves, live in their own small towns, avoiding
everyone else, and supposedly never channel without permission or
orders from the Sh&rsquo;botay or Sh&rsquo;boan. In fact, they are
the real power, and the reason the Sh&rsquo;botay and Sh&rsquo;boan
only rule seven years.&rdquo; Rich laughter bubbled up in her for a
moment. She herself had always believed in being the power behind
the power. &ldquo;Yes, a fascinating land. Too far from the center to be
of any use for many years, of course.&rdquo; She made a slight,
dismissive gesture, fluttering beringed fingers. &ldquo;There will be
plenty of time to see what can be made of it after the Day of
Return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, she definitely wanted him to think she had some
interest there. If she really had, she never would have mentioned
the place. He set his untouched goblet on the tray the muscular
fellow had ready before his hand finished moving. Graendal did
train her servants well. &ldquo;I am sure their music is fascinating,&rdquo; if
you cared for that sort of thing, &ldquo;but I have preparations to see
to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graendal laid a hand on his arm. &ldquo;Careful
preparations, I trust? The Great Lord will not be pleased if you
disturb his plans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sammael&rsquo;s mouth tightened. &ldquo;I have done
everything short of surrendering to convince al&rsquo;Thor I am no
threat to him, but the man seems obsessed with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could abandon Illian, start again
elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; He had never run from Lews Therin, and he would
not run from this provincial buffoon. The Great Lord could not
mean to put one like that above the Chosen. Above him! &ldquo;You
have told me all of the Great Lord&rsquo;s command?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dislike repeating myself, Sammael.&rdquo; Her voice held
a touch of exasperation, her eyes a hint of anger. &ldquo;If you did not
believe me the first time, you will not now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stared at her a moment longer, then nodded
brusquely. Very probably she had told the truth there; a lie
touching the Great Lord could rebound with deadly force. &ldquo;I see no
reason to meet again until you have something to tell me besides
whether Semirhage was there or not.&rdquo; His brief frown at the
harpists should be enough to convince her she had succeeded in her
misdirection; he turned his gaze into a disapproving sweep across
the people splashing in the pools, the acrobats and the rest, so it
would not seem obvious. All this wasted effort, all this display of
flesh, really did disgust him. &ldquo;Next time you can come to
Illian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shrugged as though it did not matter, but her
lips moved slightly, and his <em>saidin</em>-enhanced hearing
plucked &ldquo;If you are still there&rdquo; from the air.</p>

<p>Icily Sammael opened a gateway back to Illian. The
muscular young man failed to move quickly enough; he did not have
time to scream before he was sliced in two down the middle, him and
the tray and the crystal pitcher. The edge of a gateway made a
razor seem blunt. Graendal pursed her lips peevishly at the loss of
one of her pets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you want to help us stay alive,&rdquo; Sammael told
her, &ldquo;find out how Demandred and the others mean to carry out the
Great Lord&rsquo;s instructions.&rdquo; He stepped through the gateway,
never taking his eyes from her face.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Graendal maintained her vexed expression until the
gateway closed behind Sammael, then allowed herself to tap her
fingernails on the marble railing. With his golden hair Sammael
might have been handsome enough to stand among her pets, if he
would let Semirhage remove the burned furrow that slanted across
his face; she was the only one remaining with the skill to do what
would once have been a simple matter. It was an idle thought. The
real question was whether her effort had paid off.</p>

<p>Shaofan and Chiape played their strange atonal music,
full of complex harmonies and odd dissonances, quite beautifully;
their faces shone with joy that they might be pleasing her. She
nodded, and could almost feel their delight. They were much happier
now than they would have been left to themselves. So much effort to
procure them, and solely for this few minutes with Sammael. Of
course, she could have taken less trouble&mdash;anyone at all from
their lands would have done as well&mdash;but she had her
standards even when preparing a momentary subterfuge. Long ago she
had chosen to seek every pleasure, to deny herself none that did
not threaten her standing with the Great Lord.</p>

<p>Her eyes fell on the offal staining her carpet, and
her nose twitched irritably. The weaving might be salvaged, but it
annoyed her that she would have to remove the blood herself. She
gave quick orders, and Osana ran to oversee having the carpet
removed. And Rashan&rsquo;s remains disposed of.</p>

<p>Sammael was a transparent fool. No, not a fool. He
was deadly enough when he had something to fight directly,
something he could see clearly, but he might as well be blind when
it came to subtleties. Very likely he believed her ruse was
intended to mask what she and the others were up to. One thing he
would never consider was that she knew every twitch of his mind,
every twist of his thoughts. After all, she had spent nearly four
hundred years studying the workings of minds far more convoluted
than his. Transparent, he was. However much he tried to hide it, he
was frantic. He was trapped in a box of his own devising, a box he
would defend to the death rather than abandon, a box in which he
very probably would die.</p>

<p>She sipped her wine, and her forehead furrowed
slightly. Possibly she had already achieved her end with him,
though she had expected it to take four or five visits. She would
have to find reason to call on him in Illian; it was best to
observe the patient even after it appeared the desired path had
been taken.</p>

<p>Whether the boy was a simple farm lad or Lews Therin
himself truly come back&mdash;she could not make up her mind on
that&mdash;he had proven himself far too dangerous. She served the
Great Lord of the Dark, but she did not mean to die, not even for
the Great Lord. She would live forever. Of course, one did not go
against even the slightest of the Great Lord&rsquo;s wishes unless
one wished to spend an eternity dying and another eternity wishing
for the lesser agony of that long death. Still, Rand al&rsquo;Thor
had to be removed, but it would be Sammael who earned the blame. If
he realized that he had been aimed at Rand al&rsquo;Thor like a <em>
dornat</em> set to hunt, she would be very much surprised. No, not
a man to recognize subtleties.</p>

<p>Far from stupid, though. It would be interesting to
discover how he had found out about the binding. She herself would
never have learned had Mesaana not made a rare slip while venting
her anger on an absent Semirhage; her fury had been strong enough
that she did not realize how much she had revealed. How long had
Mesaana been tucked away inside the White Tower? The mere fact that
she was opened interesting avenues. If there were some way to
discover where Demandred and Semirhage had placed themselves, it
might be possible to work out what they intended to do. They had
not trusted her with that. Oh, no. Those three had worked together
since before the War of Power. On the surface, at least. She was
sure they had plotted against one another as assiduously as any of
the Chosen, but whether Mesaana undercut Semirhage or Semirhage
Demandred, she had never yet found a crack between them into which
a wedge could be driven.</p>

<p>A scuff of boots announced an arrival, but not men to
replace the carpet and remove Rashan. Ebram was a tall, well-made
young Domani in tight red breeches and a flowing white shirt; he
could have fit into her collection of pets if he had been more than
a merchant&rsquo;s son. His eyes were intent on her as he knelt,
dark and shining. &ldquo;The Lord Ituralde has come, Great Mistress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graendal set the goblet atop a table that at first
glance seemed to be inlaid with ivory dancers. &ldquo;Then he shall speak
with the Lady Basene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ebram rose smoothly and offered an arm for the frail
Domani woman he now saw. He knew who lay behind the weaving of
Illusion, but even so the reverence on his face faded slightly; she
knew it was Graendal, not Basene, whom he worshiped. At the moment
she did not care. Sammael was at the very least pointed at Rand
al&rsquo;Thor, and perhaps launched. As for Demandred and Semirhage
and Mesaana&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;only she herself knew that she had made her own
journey to Shayol Ghul and down to the lake of fire. Only she knew
that the Great Lord had all but promised to name her Nae&rsquo;blis,
a promise sure to be fulfilled with al&rsquo;Thor out of the way.
She would be the most obedient of the Great Lord&rsquo;s servants.
She would sow chaos till the harvest made Demandred&rsquo;s lungs
explode.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Semirhage let the iron-bound door close behind her.
One of the glowbulbs, salvaged from the Great Lord alone knew
where, flickered fitfully, but they still gave better light than
the candles and oil lamps she had to accept in this time. Aside
from the light, the place had the intimidating look of a prison,
rough stone walls and a bare floor with a small crude wooden table
in one corner. Not her notion; she would have had it all spotless
white and gleaming <em>cueran</em>, sleek and sterile. This place
had been prepared before she knew the need. A pale-haired silk-clad
woman hung spread-eagled from nothing in the middle of the room,
glaring at her defiantly. An Aes Sedai. Semirhage hated Aes
Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the patient demanded. &ldquo;A Darkfriend? A
Black sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ignoring the noise, Semirhage quickly checked the
buffer between the woman and <em>saidar</em>. If it failed, she
could mask the wretch again with no trouble&mdash;it was a measure
of the woman&rsquo;s weakness that she could afford to leave the
knotted buffer unwatched&mdash;but taking care was second nature
to her, taking each step in its exact turn. Now for the
woman&rsquo;s clothing. Someone in garments felt safer than someone
without. Delicately she wielded Fire and Wind, slicing away dress
and shift and every scrap right down to the patient&rsquo;s shoes.
Drawing everything out in front of the woman in one compressed
bundle, she channeled again, Fire and Earth, and fine dust rained
down onto the stone floor.</p>

<p>The woman&rsquo;s blue eyes bulged. Semirhage doubted
she could duplicate those simple feats even if she had been able to
follow them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; This time there was an edge to the
demand. Fear perhaps. It was always good if that began early.</p>

<p>Precisely Semirhage located the centers in the
woman&rsquo;s brain that received messages of pain from the body,
and just as meticulously began to stimulate them with Spirit and
Fire. Only a little at first, building slowly. Too much at once
could kill in moments, yet it was remarkable how far the system
could be taken if fed in finely increasing increments. Working on
something you could not see was a difficult task, even this close,
but she was as knowledgeable about the human body as anyone had
ever been.</p>

<p>The spread-eagled patient shook her head as if she
could shake off the pain, then realized she could not and fixed
Semirhage with a stare. Semirhage merely watched, and maintained
the net. Even in something as hurried as this must be, she could
afford a little patience.</p>

<p>How she did hate any who called themselves Aes Sedai.
She had been one herself, a true Aes Sedai, not an ignorant fool
like the simpleton hanging before her. She had been known, famed,
whisked to every corner of the world for her ability to mend any
injury, to bring people back from the brink when everyone else said
there was nothing more to be done. And a delegation from the Hall
of the Servants had offered her a choice that was no choice: to be
bound never to know her pleasures again, and with that binding be
able to see the end of life approach; or else to be severed, and
cast out as Aes Sedai. They had expected her to accept binding;
that was the rational, proper thing to do, and they were rational,
proper men and women. They never expected her to flee. She had been
one of the first to go to Shayol Ghul.</p>

<p>Fat beads of sweat popped out on the patient&rsquo;s
pale face. Her jaw knotted, and her nostrils flared as she sucked
in air. Now and then she gave a small grunt. Patience. Soon,
now.</p>

<p>It had been jealousy, the jealousy of those who could
not do what she could. Had anyone she pulled back from death&rsquo;s
grasp ever said they would rather have died than suffer the little
extra she exacted? And the others? There were always those who
deserved to suffer. What matter that she enjoyed giving them their
deserts? The Hall and its hypocritical whining about legalities and
rights. She had deserved the right to do as she did; she had earned
the right. She had been more valuable to the world than all those
together who entertained her with their screams. And in jealousy
and spite the Hall had tried to pull her down!</p>

<p>Well, some of them had fallen into her hands during
the war. Given time she could break the strongest man, the proudest
woman, mold them exactly as she wanted them to be. The process
might be slower than Compulsion, but it was infinitely more
enjoyable, and she did not think even Graendal could undo what she
did. Compulsion could be unraveled. But her patients&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;on their
knees they had begged to give their souls to the Shadow, and had
served obediently until they died. Each time Demandred had been
full of what a coup it was, another Counselor of the Hall publicly
proclaiming allegiance to the Great Lord, but for her the best part
had been the way their faces went pale, even years later, when they
saw her, the way they hurried to assure her that they remained
faithful to what she had made of them.</p>

<p>The first sob ripped out of the woman hanging in the
air and was stifled. Semirhage waited impassively. Haste might be
necessary here, but too much haste could spoil everything. More
sobbing erupted, overwhelming the patient&rsquo;s efforts to subdue
it, growing louder, louder, until it swelled to a howl. Semirhage
waited. The woman shone with a greasy slick of sweat; her head
flung from side to side, flailing her hair, and she jerked
helplessly in her unseen tethers, convulsive flutters.
Full-throated, ear-shattering shrieks lasted until breath was
exhausted and began again as soon as lungs could be filled. Those
wide bulging blue eyes saw nothing; they seemed to be glazing. Now
it began.</p>

<p>Semirhage cut off her streams of <em>saidar</em>
abruptly, but minutes passed before the screams subsided into
panting. &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; she asked gently. The question did
not matter as long as it was one the woman would answer. It could
have been &ldquo;Do you still defy me?&rdquo;&mdash;it was often pleasant to
keep on with that one until they pleaded to prove they no longer
did&mdash;but she needed to make every question count this
time.</p>

<p>Involuntary shudders ran through the hanging woman.
Giving Semirhage a wary, slitted gaze, she licked her lips,
coughed, and finally muttered hoarsely, &ldquo;Cabriana Mecandes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Semirhage smiled. &ldquo;It is good to tell me the truth.&rdquo;
There were pain centers in the brain, and pleasure centers. She
stimulated one of the latter, just for a few moments but hard, as
she moved closer. The jolt widened Cabriana&rsquo;s eyes as far as
they would go; she gasped and shook. Plucking a handkerchief from
her sleeve, Semirhage lifted the woman&rsquo;s wondering face and
tenderly dabbed away sweat. &ldquo;I know this is very hard on you,
Cabriana,&rdquo; she said warmly. &ldquo;You must try not to make it more
difficult.&rdquo; With a soft touch she smoothed damp hair away from the
woman&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Would you like something to drink?&rdquo; Not waiting
for an answer, she channeled; a battered metal flask floated from
the small table in the corner to her hand. The Aes Sedai never took
her eyes from Semirhage, but she drank thirstily. After a few
swallows, Semirhage took the flask away and returned it to the
table. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s better, isn&rsquo;t it? Remember, try not
to make it difficult for yourself.&rdquo; As she turned away, the woman
spoke again, in a rasping voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I spit in the milk of your mother, Darkfriend! Do
you hear me? I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Semirhage stopped listening. Any other time there
would have been a spreading glow of pleasure that the
patient&rsquo;s defiance had not been crushed yet. The purest
exhilaration came from shaving away defiance and dignity in minute
slices, watching the patient finally realize that they were going
and struggle vainly to cling to what remained. No time for that
now. Carefully she once more set the web on the pain centers of
Cabriana&rsquo;s brain and knotted it. Normally she liked to be in
personal control, but some haste was necessary. Triggering the net,
she channeled to extinguish the lights and left, closing the door
behind her. Darkness would work its part, too. Alone, in the dark,
with the pain.</p>

<p>Despite herself Semirhage made a vexed sound. There
was no finesse in this. She did not like having to hurry. And to be
called away from her charge; the girl was willful and obdurate, the
circumstances difficult.</p>

<p>The corridor came close to matching the chamber for
bleakness, a broad shadowy shaft through stone, with crossing
passageways that she had no desire to explore nearly lost in the
murk. Only two other doors were in sight, one leading to her
present quarters. They were comfortable enough rooms if she had to
be here, but she made no move toward them. Shaidar Haran stood in
front of that door, black-clad and wreathed in dimness like smoke,
so still that it was almost a shock when it spoke, a sound of bone
dust being ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you learned?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The summons to Shayol Ghul had resulted in a warning
from the Great Lord. WHEN YOU OBEY SHAIDAR HARAN, YOU OBEY ME. WHEN
YOU DISOBEY SHAIDAR HARAN&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;however much the warning nettled,
there had been no need for more. &ldquo;Her name. Cabriana Mecandes. I
could hardly learn more so quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It flowed across the hallway in that eye-wrenching
way, ebon cloak hanging in denial of motion. One moment it was a
statue ten paces away, the next it loomed over her so she had the
choice of backing away or craning her neck to look up at that
dead-white, eyeless face. Backing away was out of the question.
 &ldquo;You will drain her completely, Semirhage. You will squeeze her
dry, without delay, and tell me every scrap that you learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promised the Great Lord that I would,&rdquo; she told it
coldly.</p>

<p>Bloodless lips twisted in a smile. That was its only
reply. Turning sharply, it strode away through patches of shadow&mdash;and abruptly was gone.</p>

<p>Semirhage wished she knew how Myrddraal did that. It
had nothing to do with the Power, but on the edges of shadow, where
light was becoming dark, a Myrddraal could suddenly be elsewhere,
in another shadow far away. Long ago Aginor had tested over a
hundred of them to destruction in a vain effort to learn how it was
done. The Myrddraal themselves did not know; she herself had proved
that.</p>

<p>Abruptly she realized that her hands were pressed
hard against her stomach, which seemed a ball of ice. It had been
many years since she had felt fear anywhere except facing the Great
Lord in the Pit of Doom. The frozen lump began to melt as she moved
to the other prison door. Later she would analyze the emotion
dispassionately; Shaidar Haran might be different from any other
Myrddraal she had ever seen, but it was still a Myrddraal.</p>

<p>Her second patient, hanging like the first in midair,
was a blocky, square-faced man in a green coat and breeches
suitable for fading into a forest. A full half of the glowbulbs
here shimmered on the edge of failure&mdash;that any had survived
so long was a miracle&mdash;but Cabriana&rsquo;s Warder was
unimportant, really. What was needed, for whatever purpose, rested
in the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s mind, yet the Myrddraal apparently had been
told to capture an Aes Sedai, and in their minds for some reason
Aes Sedai and Warders seemed inseparable. As well they had, though.
She had not before had an opportunity to break one of these storied
fighters.</p>

<p>His dark eyes tried to bore holes through her head as
she removed his clothing and boots and destroyed them as she had
Cabriana&rsquo;s. He was hairy, a mass of large hard muscles
and scars. He never flinched. He said nothing. His defiance was
different from the woman&rsquo;s. Hers was bold, flung in your face,
his a quiet refusal to bend. He might be harder to crack than his
mistress. Normally he would have been much the more
interesting.</p>

<p>Pausing, Semirhage studied him. There was something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a tightness around the mouth and eyes. As if he already fought
pain. Of course. That peculiar bond between Aes Sedai and Warder.
Strange that these primitives should have come up with something
that none of the Chosen understood, yet it was so. From the little
she knew, this fellow quite possibly felt at least some of what the
other patient was undergoing. Another time that would present
interesting possibilities. Now, it only meant that he thought he
knew what he was facing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your owner does not take very good care of you,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;If she was more than a savage, there would be no need for
you to be marred with all those scars.&rdquo; His expression changed only
slightly. To a tinge of contempt. &ldquo;So.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time she set the net on the pleasure centers and
began the slowly increasing stimulation. He was intelligent. He
frowned, shook his head, then his eyes narrowed, fixed on her like
chips of dark ice. He knew he should not be feeling that rising
bliss, and though he could not see her net, he knew it had to be
her work, so he set himself to fight it. Semirhage almost smiled.
No doubt he thought pleasure easier to fight than pain. On rare
occasions she had broken patients with no more than this. It gave
her little enjoyment, and afterward they could not think
coherently, simply wanting more of the ecstasy that bloomed in
their heads, but it was quick, and they would do absolutely
anything for more. That lack of coherence was why she had not used
it on the other patient; she needed answers there. This fellow
would learn the difference soon enough.</p>

<p>Difference. She put a finger to her lips in thought.
Why was Shaidar Haran different from every other Myrddraal? She did
not like discovering an oddity just when everything seemed to be
going in their favor, and a Myrddraal set above the Chosen, even
occasionally, was more than a mere oddity. Al&rsquo;Thor was
blinded, his attention all on Sammael, and Graendal was letting
Sammael know enough to keep him from ruining everything with his
pride. Of course, Graendal and Sammael were certainly scheming for
advantage, together or separately. Sammael was a hot <em>sofar</em> with
warped steering planes, and Graendal not much easier to predict.
They had never learned that power came only from the Great Lord,
handed out as he chose, for his own reasons. At his whims; she
could think that in the safety of her head.</p>

<p>More troubling were the Chosen who had vanished.
Demandred insisted they must be dead, but she and Mesaana were not
so sure. Lanfear. If there was any justice, time would give her
Lanfear. The woman was always there when least expected, always
behaving as if she had the right to dabble her fingers in
others&rsquo; plans, always flitting to safety if her dabbling
brought ruin. Moghedien. She skulked out of sight, but she had
never gone so long before without making herself known, just to
remind the rest of them that she, too, was Chosen. Asmodean. A
traitor, and so doomed, but he really had vanished, and Shaidar
Haran&rsquo;s existence and her own orders here combined to remind
her that the Great Lord worked in his own ways toward his own
goals.</p>

<p>The Chosen were no more than pieces on the board;
they might be Counselors and Spires, but they were still pieces. If
the Great Lord moved her here secretly, might he not be moving
Moghedien or Lanfear, or even Asmodean? Might Shaidar Haran not be
sent to deliver covert commands to Graendal or Sammael? Or for that
matter, to Demandred or Mesaana? Their uneasy alliance&mdash;if it
could be called by so strong a name&mdash;had lasted a long time,
but neither would tell her if they received secret orders from the
Great Lord, any more than she would ever let them learn of the
orders that had brought her here, or those that had had her send
Myrddraal and Trollocs to the Stone of Tear to battle those sent by
Sammael.</p>

<p>If the Great Lord meant to make al&rsquo;Thor
Nae&rsquo;blis, she herself would kneel to him&mdash;and wait for a
slip to deliver him into her hands. Immortality meant infinite time
to wait. There would always be other patients to amuse her in the
meantime. What troubled her was Shaidar Haran. She had never been
more than an indifferent <em>tcheran</em> player, but Shaidar Haran
was a new piece on the board, one of unknown strength and purpose.
And one daring way to capture your opponent&rsquo;s High Counselor
and turn it to your side was to sacrifice your Spires in a false
attack. She would kneel if need be, for as long as need be, but she
would not be sacrificed.</p>

<p>An odd feel to the net pulled her out of her
thoughts. She took one look at the patient and clicked her tongue
in exasperation. His head hung to one side, chin dark with blood
where he had chewed his tongue, eyes staring and already filmed
over. Inattention and she had let the stimulation grow too fast,
too far. With an irritation that never touched her face, she
stopped channeling. There was no point trying to stimulate the
brain of a corpse.</p>

<p>A sudden thought occurred to her. If the Warder could
feel what the Aes Sedai felt, was the reverse true? Eyeing the
scars that decorated the man&rsquo;s body, she was sure it was
impossible; even these simple fools would have altered the bond if
it meant sharing the feel of <em>that</em>. Still, she abandoned
the cadaver and stepped across the corridor with some haste.</p>

<p>Screams heard before she opened the iron-bound door
onto darkness brought a deep breath of relief. Killing the woman
before draining her of everything she knew would probably have
meant remaining here until another Aes Sedai was captured. At the
least.</p>

<p>There were barely intelligible words among the
throat-shredding howls, words that seemed to have all the force of
the patient&rsquo;s soul behind them. &ldquo;Pleeeeaaaase! Oh Light
PLEEEEAAAASE!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Semirhage smiled faintly. There was a little fun in
this after all.</p>
