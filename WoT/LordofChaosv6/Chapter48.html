<h4><em>Leaning on the Knife</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">C</span>limbing
out of the big copper tub with a length of
white toweling wrapped around her head, Nynaeve dried slowly. The
plump gray-haired serving woman tried to dress her, but Nynaeve
sent her away, ignoring the startled looks and protests, and did it
herself, with great care, examining the dark green dress with its
wide collar of pale Merada lace in the tall narrow stand-mirror.
Lan&rsquo;s heavy gold ring lay in her pouch&mdash;best not
to think of that&mdash;alongside one of the twisted ring <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, and the Great Serpent gleamed golden around
the third finger of her right hand. Her right hand. Best not to
think of that either.</p>

<p>The high ceiling was quite pleasantly painted in blue
sky and white clouds, and if the furnishings stood on
disconcertingly large gilded lion feet and the slim bedposts and
chair legs and everything else vertical had too much fluting and
gilding for her taste, it was still a more comfortable room than
she had stayed in for some considerable time. A pleasant room.
Moderately cool. What she was trying to do was calm herself.</p>

<p>It did not work, of course. She had felt <em>
saidar</em> being woven, and as soon as she stepped from her
bedchamber she saw the ward against eavesdropping Elayne had made
and tied off around the sitting room. Birgitte and Aviendha were
already there as well, all of them freshly scrubbed and
dressed.</p>

<p>In what Birgitte claimed was a rather ordinary
arrangement here, four bedchambers flanked the one sitting room,
which also had a ceiling painted as sky and clouds. Four tall
arched windows opened onto a long balcony of white-painted wrought
iron, so intricate they could peer down from it unseen at the Mol
Hara Square in front of the palace. A faint breeze stirred through
the windows, carrying the salt scent of the sea, and for a wonder
it actually was a little cool. Anger interfered with her
concentration, and Nynaeve had been feeling the heat since shortly
after arriving in the Tarasin Palace.</p>

<p>Thom and Juilin had been given a room somewhere deep
in the servants&rsquo; quarters, which in truth seemed to irritate
Elayne more than it did either of the men. Thom had actually
laughed. But then, he could afford to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have some of this excellent tea, Nynaeve,&rdquo; Elayne
said, laying a white napkin across gleaming blue silk skirts. Like
everything else in the sitting room, her wide chair had gilded
balls for feet, and more standing along the tall back above her
head. Aviendha sat by her side, but on the floor, legs folded
beneath the skirt of a high-necked dress that almost matched the
pale green tile. Her labyrinthine silver necklace went very well
with the dress. Nynaeve did not think she had seen the Aiel woman
sit in a chair once. People had certainly stared at her in those
two inns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mint and cloudberries,&rdquo; Birgitte added to
Elayne&rsquo;s offer, filling another delicate golden porcelain cup
without waiting. Birgitte wore wide gray trousers and a short blue
coat. She did wear dresses occasionally, but her taste made Nynaeve
glad it was seldom. All three of them dressed and primped, and no
one wanted them.</p>

<p>The silver pitcher glistened damply, and the tea was
cool and refreshing. Nynaeve admired Elayne&rsquo;s face, cool and
dry. She herself already felt moist again despite the breeze. &ldquo;I
must say,&rdquo; she muttered, &ldquo;I expected a different reception.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you really?&rdquo; Elayne asked. &ldquo;After the way
Vandene and Adeleas treated us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve sighed. &ldquo;Very well, then, I hoped. I am
finally Aes Sedai, really Aes Sedai, and nobody seems to believe
it. I truly hoped leaving Salidar would make a difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their meeting with Merilille Ceandevin had not gone
well. Their presentation to her, in truth. Vandene&rsquo;s
introduction had been almost perfunctory, and then they were
dismissed, sent away so the real Aes Sedai could talk. Merilille
had said she was sure they wanted to freshen up, but it was a
dismissal, with a choice of going like obedient Accepted or
refusing like sulky children. Just remembering ruined all
Nynaeve&rsquo;s attempts at calm; sweat began to run down her
face.</p>

<p>Being sent away was not the worst of it, really.
Merilille was a slender, palely elegant Cairhienin with glossy
black hair and large liquid eyes, a Gray who looked as if nothing
had ever surprised her and nothing ever could. Only those dark eyes
had gone wide when told Nynaeve and Elayne were Aes Sedai, and
wider still on learning Egwene was the Amyrlin Seat. Birgitte as a
Warder clearly astounded her, though by that time she managed to
hold her reaction to one stare and a brief tightening of her lips.
Aviendha came out of it the easiest; Merilille gave her only a
murmur about how much she would enjoy being a novice. Then came the
dismissal. And a suggestion, more in the nature of a command, that
they spend several days <em>recuperating</em> from the <em>
rigors</em> of their journey.</p>

<p>Nynaeve plucked her handkerchief from her sleeve and
fanned her face uselessly with the lacy square. &ldquo;I still think
they&rsquo;re hiding something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Nynaeve,&rdquo; Elayne said, shaking her head. &ldquo;I
do <em>not</em> like how we&rsquo;re treated any more than you, but
you are trying to make a bull out of a mouse. If Vandene and
Adeleas want to look for runaways, let them. Would you rather have
them trying to take over looking for the bowl?&rdquo; During the whole
journey they had hardly mentioned the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>
they sought, for fear the pair would do just that.</p>

<p>Whether they would have or not, Nynaeve still thought
they were hiding things. Elayne just did not want to admit it.
Adeleas had not realized that Nynaeve had overheard that remark
about looking for runaways once they reached Ebou Dar, and when
Nynaeve asked whether they really expected to find any, Vandene
replied just a bit too quickly that they always kept an eye out for
young women who had run from the Tower. It did not make sense. No
one had run away from Salidar, but novices did run sometimes&mdash;the life was hard, especially with years of obedience to look
forward to before you could even think of thinking for yourself&mdash;and an occasional Accepted who had begun to despair of ever
reaching the shawl tried to slip away, yet even Nynaeve knew that
few made it off the island of Tar Valon and almost all were dragged
back. You could be put out at any time, for not being strong enough
to go on, for refusing or failing your test for Accepted or the
test for Aes Sedai that she and Elayne had slipped by, but leaving
was never your decision unless you wore the shawl.</p>

<p>So if successful runaways were so rare, why did
Vandene and Adeleas think they might find one in Ebou Dar, and why
had they shut up like mussels when she asked? She was afraid she
knew the answer to the last, anyway. Not tugging her braid required
considerable self-control. She thought she was becoming better at
that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least Mat finally knows we&rsquo;re Aes Sedai,&rdquo;
she growled. At least she could deal with him now. Let him try
anything, and he would see what it was like being thumped with
everything she could wrap a flow around. &ldquo;He had better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that why you&rsquo;ve been avoiding him like a
Cheltan flinching from the tax collector?&rdquo; Birgitte asked with a
grin, and Nynaeve felt her face coloring. She thought she had
hidden her feelings better than that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is very irritating, even for a man,&rdquo; Aviendha
murmured. &ldquo;You must have traveled very far, Birgitte. You often
speak of places I have never heard of. One day I would like to
travel the wetlands and see all these strange places. Where is this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Cheltan? Chelta?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That wiped Birgitte&rsquo;s grin right off; wherever
it was, it might be dead a thousand years, or since an earlier Age
altogether. Her and her slipping ancient places and things into the
conversation. Nynaeve wished she had been there to see her admit to
Egwene what Egwene already knew. Egwene had grown impressively
forceful in her time with the Aiel, and put up with little she
considered nonsense. Birgitte had actually come back looking
chastened.</p>

<p>Even so, Nynaeve liked Birgitte rather better than
she did Aviendha, who made her very uneasy at times with her hard
stares and bloodthirsty talk. And however irritating Birgitte could
be, Nynaeve had promised to help her keep her secret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;threatened me,&rdquo; she said hurriedly. It was
the first way that came to mind to divert Aviendha and the last
thing she wanted anyone else to know. Her cheeks heated all over
again. Elayne actually smiled, though she had the grace to hide it
in her teacup. &ldquo;Not like that,&rdquo; Nynaeve added when Aviendha began
frowning and fingering her belt knife. The Aiel woman seemed to
think the proper response to everything was a violent one. &ldquo;It was
just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Aviendha and Birgitte looked at her, all ears and
interest. &ldquo;He just said&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; As she had rescued Birgitte, Elayne
rescued her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really think that is enough about Master Cauthon,&rdquo;
Elayne said firmly. &ldquo;He is only here to pull him out of
Egwene&rsquo;s hair, and I can puzzle out what to do about the <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> later.&rdquo; Her lips compressed for a moment. She
had not been happy when Vandene and Adeleas began channeling at Mat
without so much as a by-your-leave, and even less when he slipped
off to that inn. There had been nothing she could do, of course.
She claimed that by only telling him to do what he had to do anyway
in the beginning, she could bring him into the habit. Well, good
luck to her. &ldquo;He is the least important part of this trip,&rdquo; she
said, even more firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Nynaeve just kept the relief out of her voice.
 &ldquo;Yes, the bowl is what&rsquo;s important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suggest I scout about first,&rdquo; Birgitte said. &ldquo;Ebou
Dar seems rougher than I remember, and the district you describe
could be rougher than&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She did not quite glance at Aviendha.
 &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;than the rest of the city,&rdquo; she finished with a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there is scouting to be done,&rdquo; Aviendha put in
eagerly, &ldquo;I wish to be part of it. I have a <em>
cadin&rsquo;sor</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A scout is supposed to blend in,&rdquo; Elayne said
gently. &ldquo;I think we should find Ebou Dari dress for <em>all</em> of
us; then we can all search together from the start, and none of us
will stand out. Though Nynaeve will have the easiest time of it,&rdquo;
she added, smiling at Birgitte and Aviendha. The Ebou Dari they had
seen so far all had dark hair, and most seemed to have nearly black
eyes.</p>

<p>Aviendha exhaled glumly, and Nynaeve felt like
echoing her, thinking of those deep necklines. Very deep, however
narrow. Birgitte actually grinned; the woman had no shame at
all.</p>

<p>Before the discussion could go any further, a woman
with short black hair, in the livery of House Mitsobar, entered
without knocking, which Nynaeve thought rude no matter what Elayne
said was proper for servants. Her dress was white, the skirt sewn
up to the knee on the left side to expose a green petticoat, with a
snug bodice embroidered on the left breast with a green Anchor and
Sword. Even the livery&rsquo;s narrow neckline plunged as far as
Nynaeve recalled. Plump and somewhere in her middle years, the
woman hesitated, then curtsied and addressed herself to everyone.
 &ldquo;Queen Tylin wishes to see the three Aes Sedai, if it pleases
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve exchanged wondering looks with Elayne and the
others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are only two of us Aes Sedai here,&rdquo; Elayne
said after a moment. &ldquo;Perhaps you meant to go to Merilille?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was directed to this apartment&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Aes Sedai.&rdquo;
The pause was barely long enough to notice, and the woman just
missed turning the title into a question.</p>

<p>Elayne rose, smoothing her skirts; no stranger would
suspect that that smooth face hid anger, but there was a hint of
tightness at the corners of eyes and mouth. &ldquo;Shall we go, then?
Nynaeve? Aviendha? Birgitte?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not Aes Sedai, Elayne,&rdquo; Aviendha said, and the
serving woman put in hurriedly, &ldquo;I was told only the Aes
Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aviendha and I could have a look around the city
while you see the Queen,&rdquo; Birgitte said before Elayne could open
her mouth. Aviendha&rsquo;s face lit up.</p>

<p>Elayne gave the pair of them a sharp look, then
sighed. &ldquo;Well, at least be careful. Nynaeve, are you coming, or do
you want to see the city too?&rdquo; That last was in a dry tone, with
another glance at Birgitte.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I would not miss it,&rdquo; Nynaeve told her. &ldquo;It will
be good to finally meet someone who thinks&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She could not
finish it with the maid there. &ldquo;We should not keep the Queen
waiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; the liveried woman said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be as
much as my ears are worth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However much her ears were worth, it took some time
to walk through the palace corridors. As though to make up for all
the white outside, the palace was full of color. In one corridor
the ceiling was painted green and the walls blue, in another the
walls were yellow and the ceiling pale rose. The floor tiles were
diamonds of red and black and white, or blue and yellow, or almost
any combination in any shade. There were very few tapestries,
usually scenes of the sea, but a good many tall vases of golden Sea
Folk porcelain stood in arched niches, and also large pieces of
carved crystal, statuettes and vases and bowls, that caught
Elayne&rsquo;s eye as well as Nynaeve&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Of course servants scurried about everywhere, the
men&rsquo;s version of the livery entailing white breeches and a
long green vest over a white shirt with wide, pleated sleeves, but
before they had gone very far Nynaeve saw someone striding toward
them who made her stop and catch Elayne&rsquo;s arm. It was Jaichim
Carridin. She did not take her eyes off the tall graying man as he
strode on past them, those cruel deep-set eyes never turning in
their direction, white cloak spreading behind him. Sweat covered
his face, but he ignored it as he ignored them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is he doing here?&rdquo; Nynaeve demanded. That man
had unleashed slaughter in Tanchico, and the Light only knew where
else.</p>

<p>The serving woman looked at her quizzically. &ldquo;Why,
the Children of the Light sent an embassy too, months gone. The
Queen&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Aes Sedai?&rdquo; Again, that hesitation.</p>

<p>Elayne managed to nod graciously, but Nynaeve could
not blank the asperity from her own voice. &ldquo;Then we should not keep
her waiting.&rdquo; One thing Merilille had let slip about this Tylin was
that she was a punctilious woman, stiffly formal. But if she too
started doubting they were Aes Sedai, Nynaeve was in just the mood
to prove it.</p>

<p>The serving woman left them in a large room with a
pale blue ceiling and yellow walls, where a row of tall
triple-arched windows gave onto a long wrought-iron balcony and let
in a quite comfortable salty breeze, and before the Queen Nynaeve
and Elayne made their curtsies, proper for Aes Sedai to ruler, a
slight dip, a tiny bow of the head.</p>

<p>Tylin was a most impressive woman. No taller than
Nynaeve, she stood with a regal bearing that Elayne would have had
to strain to match on her best day. She should have replied to
their courtesies with the same, but she did not. Instead her large
black eyes examined them with imperious intensity.</p>

<p>Nynaeve returned the favor as well as she could.
Waves of glossy black hair, gray at the temples, hung well below
Tylin&rsquo;s shoulders, framing a face that was handsome if not
unlined. Shockingly, there were two scars on the woman&rsquo;s
cheeks, fine and so old they had all but vanished. Of course, she
did have one of those curved knives stuck through a belt of woven
gold, with hilt and scabbard encrusted in gems, Nynaeve was sure it
must be for show. Tylin&rsquo;s blue silk dress was certainly
nothing anyone could wear fighting a duel, with falls of snowy lace
that would nearly hide her fingers if she lowered her hands, and
skirts drawn up above her knees in front to expose layers of green
and white silk petticoats and trailing behind her a pace or more.
The bodice, trimmed in the same lace, was snug enough that Nynaeve
was not sure whether sitting in it or standing would be more
uncomfortable. A collar of woven gold fastened around the
gown&rsquo;s high neck, which put more lace under her chin,
supported a white-sheathed marriage knife hanging hilt-down into an
oval cut-out that easily equalled any of those deep necklines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You two must be Elayne and Nynaeve.&rdquo; Tylin took a
chair carved to resemble bamboo, though covered in gilt, and
arranged her skirts carefully without taking her eyes from them.
Her voice was deep, melodious and commanding. &ldquo;I understood there
was a third. Aviendha?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve exchanged glances with Elayne. There had been
no invitation for them to sit, not so much as a flicker of eyes
toward a chair. &ldquo;She is not Aes Sedai,&rdquo; Elayne began calmly.</p>

<p>Tylin spoke before she could say more. &ldquo;And you are?
You&rsquo;ve seen eighteen winters at most, Elayne. And you,
Nynaeve, staring at me like a cat with its tail caught, how many
have you seen? Twenty-two? Twenty-three perhaps? Stab my liver! I
visited Tar Valon once, and the White Tower. I doubt any woman your
age has ever worn that ring on her right hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty-six!&rdquo; Nynaeve snapped. With a good part of
the Women&rsquo;s Circle back in Emond&rsquo;s Field thinking she was
too young to be Wisdom, it had become habit with her to flourish
every naming day she could claim. &ldquo;I am twenty-six and an Aes
Sedai of the Yellow Ajah.&rdquo; She still felt a thrill of pride saying
that. &ldquo;Elayne may be eighteen, but she is Aes Sedai as well, and
Green Ajah. Do you think Merilille or Vandene would let us wear
these rings as a joke? A good many things have changed, Tylin. The
Amyrlin Seat, Egwene al&rsquo;Vere, is no older than Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she?&rdquo; Tylin said in a flat voice. &ldquo;I was not told
that. When the Aes Sedai who counseled me from the day I took the
throne, and my father before me, abruptly leaves for the Tower
without explanation, and I then learn that rumors of a Tower
divided are true; when Dragonsworn seem to spring out of the
ground; when an Amyrlin is chosen to oppose Elaida and an army
gathered under one of the great captains, inside Altara, before I
hear of it&mdash;when all of that has happened, you cannot expect
me to be enamored of surprises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve hoped her face did not look as sickly as she
felt. Why could she not learn to hold her tongue occasionally?
Abruptly she realized she could no longer sense the True Source;
anger and embarrassment did not go together very well. It was
probably to the good. If she could channel, she might make an even
bigger fool of herself.</p>

<p>Elayne moved to smooth things over without a pause.
 &ldquo;I know you have heard this before,&rdquo; she told Tylin, &ldquo;but let me
add my apologies to those of Merilille and the others. Gathering an
army inside your borders without your permission was
unconscionable. All I can say in mitigation is that events moved
quickly and we in Salidar were caught up, but that is no excuse. I
swear to you, no harm is intended to Altara, and no insult was
meant to the Throne of the Winds. Even as we speak, Gareth Bryne
leads that army north, out of Altara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tylin stared at her, unblinking. &ldquo;I have heard no
word of apology or excuse until yours. But any ruler of Altara must
learn to swallow insult from greater powers without salt.&rdquo; Taking a
deep breath, she gestured, lace waving. &ldquo;Sit, sit. Both of you sit.
Lean back on your knife and let your tongue go free.&rdquo; Her sudden
smile was very close to a grin. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you say it
in Andor. Be at ease, and speak your mind as you wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve was glad that Elayne&rsquo;s blue eyes widened
in surprise, because she herself gasped aloud. This was the woman
who Merilille had claimed required ceremony carved in polished
marble? Nynaeve was more than glad to take a chair. Thinking of all
the hidden currents in Salidar, she wondered whether Tylin was
trying to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to what? She had come to expect everyone who was
not a close friend to try manipulating her. Elayne sat on the very
front of her chair, and stiffly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean what I say,&rdquo; Tylin insisted. &ldquo;Whatever you
say, I will hear no insult.&rdquo; From the way her fingers tapped the
jeweled hilt at her waist, though, silence might be heard as
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not certain where to begin,&rdquo; Nynaeve said
carefully. She did wish Elayne had not actually nodded at that;
Elayne was supposed to know how to handle kings and queens. Why did
she not say something?</p>

<p>&ldquo;With why,&rdquo; the Queen said impatiently. &ldquo;Why do four
more Aes Sedai come to Ebou Dar from Salidar? It cannot be to
outshine Elaida&rsquo;s embassy&mdash;Teslyn does not even call it
that, and there are only her and Joline&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;you did not know?&rdquo;
Falling back in her chair laughing, she pressed the fingers of one
hand to her lips. &ldquo;Do you know about the Whitecloaks? Yes?&rdquo; Her
free hand made a slashing gesture, and her mirth began to subside
in small ripples. &ldquo;That for Whitecloaks! But I must listen to all
who court me, Lord Inquisitor Carridin as well as the others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; Nynaeve demanded. &ldquo;I am glad you
don&rsquo;t like Whitecloaks, but in that case, why must you listen
to a word Carridin says? The man&rsquo;s a butcher.&rdquo; She knew she
had made another mistake. The way Elayne suddenly seemed to be
studying the broad white fireplace, where the deep lintel was
carved into towering waves, told her that even before the last
vestige of Tylin&rsquo;s laughter snuffed out like a candle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You take me at my word,&rdquo; the Queen said quietly. &ldquo;I
said let your tongue go free, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Those dark eyes went to
the floor tiles, and she seemed to be gathering herself.</p>

<p>Nynaeve looked to Elayne, hoping for some hint of
what she had done wrong, or better, how to make it right, but
Elayne only gave her one sideways glance and the smallest shake of
her head before returning to her study of the marble waves. Maybe
she should avoid looking at Tylin, too? Yet the woman staring at
the floor drew her eyes. With one hand Tylin stroked the hilt of
her curved dagger, with the other fingered the smaller hilt nestled
between her breasts.</p>

<p>The marriage dagger told quite a lot about Tylin;
Vandene and Adeleas had been more than willing to explain some
things concerning Ebou Dar, usually those that made the city seem
unsafe for anyone not surrounded by a dozen armored guards. The
white sheath meant the Queen was widowed and did not intend to
remarry. The four pearls and one firedrop set in the gold-wrapped
hilt said she had borne four sons and one daughter; the
white-enameled setting of the firedrop and the red-enameled of
three of the pearls said only one son survived. All had been at
least sixteen when they died, and died in duels, or the settings
would have been black. What must it be like to constantly carry a
reminder of that sort! According to Vandene, women saw a red or
white setting as a source of pride, whether her stones were pearls
and firedrops or colored glass. Vandene said many Ebou Dari women
removed the stones of their children past sixteen who refused a
duel, and never acknowledged them again.</p>

<p>At long last Tylin raised her head. Her face was
pleasant, and her hand left the dagger in her belt, but she
continued to finger the marriage knife absently. &ldquo;I want my son to
follow me on the Throne of the Winds,&rdquo; she said mildly. &ldquo;Beslan is
your age, Elayne. This would be a matter of course in Andor, though
he would have to be a woman&rdquo;&mdash;she actually grinned, in
apparently genuine amusement&mdash;&ldquo;or in any other land save
Murandy, where matters are much the same as here in Altara. In the
thousand years since Artur Hawkwing, only one House has held the
throne for five generations, and Anarina&rsquo;s fall was so
precipitous that to this day House Todande is a lapdog for anyone
who wants them. No other House has ever had more than two rulers in
succession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When my father took the throne, other Houses had
more of the city itself than Mitsobar. Had he stepped outside this
palace without guards, he would have been sewn into a sack with
rocks and tossed into the river. When he died, he gave me what I
have now. Small, compared to other rulers. A man riding fresh
horses could reach the end of my writ in one day&rsquo;s hard ride.
I have not been idle, though. When news of the Dragon Reborn came,
I was certain I could hand on to Beslan twice what I hold, and
allies of a sort beyond that. The Stone of Tear and <em>
Callandor</em> changed everything. Now I thank Pedron Niall when he
arranges for Illian to take a hundred-mile swathe of Altara instead
of invading. I listen to Jaichim Carridin, and I do not spit in his
eye, however many Altarans died in the Whitecloak War. I listen to
Carridin, and to Teslyn, and to Merilille, and I pray that I can
pass something to my son instead of being found drowned in my bath
on the day Beslan meets with an accident hunting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tylin drew a long breath. The pleasant face remained,
but an edge entered her voice. &ldquo;Now. I have stood bare-breasted in
the fishmarket for you. Answer me mine. Why do I have the honor of
four more Aes Sedai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are here to find a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>,&rdquo;
Elayne said, and as Nynaeve stared in amazement, she told
everything from <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> to the dust in
the room where the bowl was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To make the weather right again would be a
miraculous blessing,&rdquo; Tylin said slowly, &ldquo;but the quarter you
describe sounds like the Rahad, across the river. Even the Civil
Guard steps lightly there. Forgive me&mdash;I understand that you
are Aes Sedai&mdash;but in the Rahad, you could have a knife in
your back before you knew it. If the clothes are fine, they use a
very narrow blade so there is little blood. Perhaps you should
leave this search to Vandene and Adeleas. I think they have had a
few more years than you to see such places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They told you about the bowl?&rdquo; Nynaeve said with a
frown, but the Queen shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only that they were here to search for something.
Aes Sedai never tell a word more than they absolutely must.&rdquo; Once
again that sudden grin flashed; it looked quite merry, though it
did make her scars show as thin lines across her cheeks. &ldquo;Until you
two, at least. May the years not change you too much. I often wish
Cavandra had not returned to the Tower; I could talk with her in
this way.&rdquo; Standing, she motioned them to remain seated and glided
across the room to tap a silver gong with an ivory mallet; it
produced quite a loud chime for such a small cylinder. &ldquo;I will send
for cool mint tea, and we will talk. You will tell me how I can
help&mdash;if I send soldiers into the Rahad, it will be the Wine
Riots all over again&mdash;and perhaps you will even be able to
explain why the bay is full of Sea Folk ships that neither dock nor
trade&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A goodly time passed over tea and talk, mostly about
the dangers of the Rahad and what Tylin could not do, and Beslan
was brought in, a soft-spoken youth who bowed respectfully and
stared with beautiful black eyes that perhaps held relief when his
mother said he could go. He certainly never doubted they were Aes
Sedai. Finally, though, the pair of them were finding their way
back to their apartment through the brightly painted corridors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they mean to take over the search too,&rdquo; Nynaeve
murmured, glancing about to make sure none of the liveried servants
was close enough to hear. Tylin had known too much about them too
soon. And however she grinned, she had been upset over the Aes
Sedai in Salidar. &ldquo;Elayne, do you think it was wise to tell her
everything? She might decide the best way to make sure that boy
gets the throne is to let us find the bowl and then tell Teslyn.&rdquo;
She remembered Teslyn slightly; a Red, and an unpleasant woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know how my mother felt about Aes Sedai traveling
about Andor, never letting her know what they were doing. I know
how I would feel. Besides, I finally remembered being taught about
that phrase&mdash;lean back on your knife and the rest. The only
way to insult somebody who says that to you is to lie.&rdquo;
Elayne&rsquo;s chin rose slightly. &ldquo;As for Vandene and Adeleas, they
only think they&rsquo;ve taken over. This Rahad may be dangerous,
but I cannot think it is any worse than Tanchico, and we won&rsquo;t
have the Black Ajah to worry about. I wager in ten days we will
have the bowl, I will know what makes Mat&rsquo;s <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> do what it should not be able to do and we
will be on our way to join Egwene, with him knuckling his forehead
as fast as Master Vanin, and Vandene and Adeleas will be left
sitting here with Merilille <em>and</em> Teslyn trying to puzzle
out what happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve could not help it; she laughed out loud. A
lanky serving man shifting a large vase of golden porcelain stared
at her, and she stuck out her tongue at him. He nearly dropped the
vase. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take that wager, except about Mat. Ten days it
is.&rdquo;</p>
