<h4><em>Questions and Answers</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ell?&rdquo;
Nynaeve said as patiently as she could.
Keeping her hands in her lap was an effort, as was sitting still on
her bed. She stifled a yawn. The hour was early, and she had not
slept well for three nights now. The wicker cage was empty, the
song sparrow set free. She wished she was free. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne was kneeling on her own bed, head and
shoulders out the window into the tiny alley behind the house. From
there she had just the slimmest line of sight to the rear of the
Little Tower, where most of the Sitters were already receiving the
Tower envoy this morning. A slight view, but enough to see a bit of
the ward against eavesdropping that enclosed the inn. It was the
sort that stopped anyone who was trying to listen with the Power.
The price of sharing knowledge.</p>

<p>After a moment Elayne sat back on her heels,
frustration painting her face. &ldquo;Nothing. You said those flows could
slip through undetected. I don&rsquo;t think I was noticed, but I
certainly heard nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That last was directed at Moghedien, on their rickety
stool in a corner. The woman&rsquo;s lack of sweat irritated Nynaeve
no end. She claimed it took time working with the Power before you
could achieve the detachment necessary to ignore heat or cold, not
much better than the Aes Sedais&rsquo; vague promises that it
would come &ldquo;eventually.&rdquo; Nynaeve and Elayne dripped sweat,
Moghedien looked cool as an early spring day, and Light, it
grated!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said they should.&rdquo; Moghedien&rsquo;s dark eyes
darted defensively, though mostly she kept her gaze on Elayne; she
always concentrated on whoever wore the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>
bracelet. &ldquo;Should. There are thousands of ways to spin wards. It
can take days to spin a hole through one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve held her tongue, but barely. They had been
trying for days. This was the third since Tarna Feir&rsquo;s
arrival, and the Hall still held the Red sister&rsquo;s message from
Elaida closely. Well, Sheriam and Myrelle and that lot knew&mdash;Nynaeve would not have been surprised if they had known before the
Hall did&mdash;but even Siuan and Leane had been shut outside of
those daily meetings. At least, they had professed to be.</p>

<p>Nynaeve realized she was plucking at her skirts, and
stilled her hands. Somehow, they had to find out what Elaida wanted&mdash;and more importantly, the Hall&rsquo;s answer. They had to.
Somehow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to go,&rdquo; Elayne sighed. &ldquo;I must show some more
sisters how I make <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>.&rdquo; Very few Aes Sedai
in Salidar showed the knack, but they all wanted to learn, and most
seemed to think they could, once they made Elayne demonstrate often
enough. &ldquo;You might as well take this,&rdquo; she added, unfastening the
bracelet. &ldquo;I want to try something new in the making after the
sisters are done with me, and then I have a novice class.&rdquo; She did
not sound happy about that either, not the way she had before the
first time. After every class, she came back so full of irritation
she bristled like a cat. The youngest girls were overeager, leaping
ahead to things they had no idea how to handle, often without
asking first, and the oldest, although a little more cautious, were
much more likely to argue, or plain balk at an order from a woman
six or seven years their junior. Elayne had taken to muttering
 &ldquo;fool novices&rdquo; and &ldquo;headstrong idiots&rdquo; like an Accepted of ten
years. &ldquo;You can have time for questions. Maybe you&rsquo;ll have
more luck with how to detect a man than I have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve shook her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m supposed to help
Janya and Delana with their notes this morning.&rdquo; She could not help
grimacing. Delana was a Sitter for the Gray Ajah as Janya was for
the Brown, but Nynaeve would get no glimmer of anything from them.
 &ldquo;And then I have another <em>lesson</em> from Theodrin.&rdquo; Another
waste of time. Everybody in Salidar was wasting time. &ldquo;Wear it,&rdquo;
she said as Elayne started to hang the bracelet on a wall peg with
their clothes.</p>

<p>The golden-haired woman gave an affected sigh, but
refastened the bracelet. In Nynaeve&rsquo;s opinion, Elayne was
entirely too trusting of the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>. True, so long as
the necklace remained on Moghedien&rsquo;s neck, any woman able to
channel could find her with the bracelet, and control her. If no
one wore the bracelet, she could not move more than a dozen paces
from it without falling to her knees retching, and the same if she
shifted the bracelet more than a few inches from where it had been
left, or tried to unfasten the necklace herself. Maybe it would
hold her even on the peg, but maybe one of the Forsaken could
reason a way around that, given enough chances. Once, in Tanchico,
Nynaeve had left Moghedien shielded and bound with the Power, for
just a few moments, and she managed to escape. The how of that had
been one of the first things Nynaeve questioned her about once she
was captured again, though prying out an answer almost required
wringing her neck. A tied-off shield was vulnerable, it seemed, if
the woman shielded had a little time and patience. Elayne insisted
that would not work against the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>&mdash;there
was no knot to attack, and with the necklace around her neck
Moghedien could not even <em>try</em> to touch <em>saidar</em>
without permission&mdash;but Nynaeve preferred taking no
chances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do your copying slowly,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
copied for Delana before. She <em>hates</em> blots or mistakes.
She&rsquo;ll make you do it over fifty times to get a clean page if
need be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve scowled. Her own hand might not be as clean
and delicate as Elayne&rsquo;s, but she was not some lout who had
just learned which end of the pen to dip in the ink. The younger
woman took no notice, simply slipped out of the room with a final
smile. Maybe she had only meant to be helpful. If the Aes Sedai
ever learned how much Nynaeve hated copying, they would start
assigning it to her for punishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you ought to go to al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; Moghedien
said abruptly. She was sitting differently, straighter. Her dark
eyes held steady on Nynaeve&rsquo;s. Why?</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Nynaeve demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and Elayne should go to Caemlyn, to Rand. She
can be queen, and you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Moghedien&rsquo;s smile was not at all
pleasant. &ldquo;Sooner or later, they will sit you down and dig for how
you can make all these marvelous discoveries yet quake like a girl
caught with stolen sweets when you try to channel for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not&mdash;!&rdquo; She was not going to explain
herself, not to this woman. Why was Moghedien so forward all of a
sudden? &ldquo;Just you remember, whatever happens to me if they find out
the truth, your head will be on the chopping block before the week
is done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whereas you will have much longer to suffer.
Semirhage once made a man scream his every waking hour for five
years. She even kept him sane, but in the end even she could not
keep his heart beating. I doubt any of these children have a tenth
of Semirhage&rsquo;s skill, but you may find out firsthand how much
they do have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How could the woman be saying this? Her normal
cringing anxiety had been shed like a snake skin. They could have
been two equals discussing something of casual interest. No, worse.
Moghedien&rsquo;s attitude said it was of casual interest to her,
but dire to Nynaeve. Nynaeve wished she had the bracelet. It would
have been a comfort. Moghedien&rsquo;s emotions could not possibly
be as cool and calm as her face, and her voice.</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s breath caught. The bracelet. That was
it. The bracelet was not in the room. A ball of ice formed in the
pit of her stomach; the sweat suddenly seemed to roll more heavily
down her face. Logically, whether the bracelet was there or not
made no difference. Elayne had it on&mdash;<em>Please, Light,
don&rsquo;t let her have taken it off!</em>&mdash;and the other
half of the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> was firmly around Moghedien&rsquo;s
neck. Only, logic had nothing to do with it. Nynaeve had never been
alone with the woman without the bracelet there. Or rather, the
only times she had had ended in near total disaster. Moghedien had
not been wearing the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> then, but that made no
difference either. She was one of the Forsaken, they were alone,
and Nynaeve had no way to control her. She gripped her skirts to
keep from gripping her belt knife.</p>

<p>Moghedien&rsquo;s smile deepened, as if she had read
her thoughts. &ldquo;In this, you can be sure I have your best interests
at heart. This,&rdquo; her hand hovered near the necklace for a moment,
carefully not touching it, &ldquo;will hold me in Caemlyn as well as
here. Slavery there is better than death here. But don&rsquo;t take
too long to decide. If these so-called Aes Sedai resolve to return
to the Tower, what better gift to take the new Amyrlin Seat than
you, a woman so close to Rand al&rsquo;Thor? And Elayne. If he feels
for her half what she does for him, holding her will tie a cord to
him he&rsquo;ll never be able to cut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve stood, forcing her knees straight. &ldquo;You can
make the beds and clean the room, now. I expect to find it spotless
when I return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much time do you have?&rdquo; Moghedien said before
she reached the door. The woman could have been asking whether the
water was hot for tea. &ldquo;A few more days at most before they send
their answer back to Tar Valon? A few hours? How will they balance
Rand al&rsquo;Thor, and even Elaida&rsquo;s supposed crimes, against
making their precious White Tower whole again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pay special attention to the chamber pots,&rdquo; Nynaeve
said without turning around. &ldquo;I want them clean this time.&rdquo; She
left before Moghedien could say anything else, shutting the door
behind her firmly.</p>

<p>She leaned back against the rough wooden planks,
breathing deeply in the cramped windowless hallway. Dipping into
her belt pouch, she plucked out a small sack and popped two frilly
goosemint leaves into her mouth. Goosemint took time to soothe a
burning belly, but she chewed and swallowed as though haste could
make it work faster. The last few moments had been one blow after
another as Moghedien shattered one thing after another that she had
<em>known</em>. Even with all her distrust, she had believed the
woman cowed. False. Oh, Light, false. She had been sure Moghedien
knew almost as little about Elayne and Rand as the Aes Sedai did.
False. And for her to suggest going to him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;they had talked
too freely in front of her. What else had they let slip, and what
use could Moghedien make of it?</p>

<p>Another Accepted entered the dim hall from the small
house&rsquo;s front room, and Nynaeve straightened, tucking the
goosemint away and smoothing her dress. Every room but the front
one had been made into sleeping quarters, and Accepted and servants
filled them, three or four to a room not much larger than the one
behind her and sometimes two to a bed. The other Accepted was a
slight woman, almost wispy, with gray eyes and a quick grin. An
Illianer, Emara did not like Siuan or Leane, which Nynaeve found
easy to understand, and thought they should be sent away&mdash;decently, as she put it&mdash;the way stilled women always had
been, but aside from that she was pleasant, not even resenting
Elayne and Nynaeve&rsquo;s &ldquo;extra space&rdquo; or &ldquo;Marigan&rdquo; doing their
chores. No few did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear you do be copying for Janya and Delana,&rdquo; she
said in her high-pitched voice, brushing past toward her own room.
 &ldquo;Take my advice, and write as fast you can. Janya does care more
for getting all her words down than for a few smudges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve glared at Emara&rsquo;s back. Write slow for
Delana. Write fast for Janya. A fine lot of counsel that added up
to. In any case, she could not make herself worry about blotting
copy now. Or even about Moghedien, until she had a chance to talk
it over with Elayne.</p>

<p>Shaking her head and muttering under her breath, she
stalked outside. Maybe she had been taking things for granted,
letting things slip, but it was time to give herself a good shake
and stop it. She knew who she had to find.</p>

<p>In the last few days a quiet had settled over
Salidar, although the streets were just as crowded. For one thing,
the forges outside the village were silent. Everyone had been told
to guard their tongues while Tarna was there, about the embassy on
its way to Caemlyn, about Logain, who was safely tucked away in one
of the soldiers&rsquo; camps, even about the soldiers themselves,
and why they had been gathered. It left most fearful of saying
anything at all above a whisper. The low buzz of talk had an
anxious note.</p>

<p>Everyone was affected. Servants who normally hurried
now moved hesitantly, casting fearful glances over their shoulders.
Even Aes Sedai seemed wary beneath their calm, eyeing each other in
a calculating manner. There were few soldiers in the streets now,
as though Tarna had not seen her fill the first day and come to her
own conclusions. The wrong answer to the Hall would put nooses
around all their necks; even rulers and nobles who wanted to stand
aside from the Tower troubles would likely hang any soldiers they
laid hands on, just to keep the notion of rebellion from spreading.
Feeling the uncertainty, those few wore carefully blank faces or
anxious frowns. Except for Gareth Bryne, waiting patiently in front
of the Little Tower. He had been there every day, from before the
Sitters arrived until they left. She thought he wanted to make sure
they remembered him, and what he was doing for them. The one time
she had seen the Sitters coming out, they had not appeared pleased
to see him.</p>

<p>Only the Warders seemed no different for the Red
sister&rsquo;s arrival. The Warders and the children. Nynaeve gave a
start when three small girls burst up in front of her like quail,
ribbons in their hair, sweaty, dusty and laughing as they ran. The
children did not know what Salidar waited for, and likely would not
understand if they did know. Each Warder would follow his Aes
Sedai, whatever she decided and wherever she went, and never turn a
hair.</p>

<p>Most of the muted talk seemed to be about the
weather. That and tales from elsewhere about strange happenings,
two-headed calves talking and men smothered by swarms of flies, all
the children in a village disappearing in the middle of the night
and people struck dead by something unseen in broad daylight.
Anyone who could think clearly knew that the drought and
unseasonable heat were the Dark One&rsquo;s hand touching the world,
but even most Aes Sedai doubted Elayne and Nynaeve&rsquo;s claims
that the other happenings were as real, that bubbles of evil were
rising from the Dark One&rsquo;s prison as the seals weakened,
rising and drifting along the Pattern till they burst. Most people
could not think clearly. Some blamed it all on Rand. Some said the
Creator was displeased that the world had not gathered behind the
Dragon Reborn, or displeased that the Aes Sedai had not captured
and gentled him, or displeased that Aes Sedai were opposing a
seated Amyrlin. Nynaeve had heard people say the weather would come
right as soon as the Tower was whole again. She pushed through the
crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;swear it&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; murmured a cook all
flour to her elbows. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Whitecloak army massed the
other side the Eldar, just waiting word from Elaida to attack.&rdquo;
Aside from the weather and two-headed calves, tales of Whitecloaks
outnumbered every other sort, but <em>Whitecloaks</em> waiting
orders from <em>Elaida</em>? The heat had melted the woman&rsquo;s
brains!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Light stand witness, it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; a
grizzled carter muttered to a frowning woman whose well-cut wool
dress marked her an Aes Sedai&rsquo;s maid. &ldquo;Elaida&rsquo;s dead. The
Red&rsquo;s come to summon Sheriam to be the new Amyrlin.&rdquo; The woman
nodded, accepting every word of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say Elaida&rsquo;s a fine Amyrlin,&rdquo; one
rough-coated man-said, shifting a bundle of fagots on his shoulder.
 &ldquo;As fine as any.&rdquo; He did not murmur to his companion. He spoke
loudly, trying hard not to look around to see who had heard
him.</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s mouth twisted sourly. He wanted to be
overheard. How <em>had</em> Elaida discovered Salidar so quickly?
Tarna must have left Tar Valon soon after Aes Sedai began gathering
in the village. Siuan had pointed out darkly that a goodly number
of Blue sisters were still missing&mdash;the original message to
gather in Salidar had been aimed at Blues&mdash;and Alviarin was
accomplished at applying the question. A stomach-turning thought,
but not as wrenching as the most common explanation: secret
supporters of Elaida here in Salidar. Everybody looked sideways at
everybody else, and the woodsman was not the first Nynaeve had
heard say much the same, in the same manner. Aes Sedai might not
say it, but Nynaeve suspected some wanted to. It all stirred
Salidar into a stew, and not a tasty one. It made what she was
doing even more right.</p>

<p>Finding who she sought took time. She needed groups
of children playing, and there were not many children in Salidar.
Sure enough, Birgitte was watching five boys scramble about the
street throwing a small bag of pebbles at each other, all laughing
uproariously whenever one of them was hit, including the one hit.
It made no more sense than most boys&rsquo; games. Or
men&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Birgitte was not alone, of course. She seldom was
unless she made an effort to be. Areina stood at her shoulder,
dabbing at the perspiration streaming down her face and trying not
to show boredom with the children. A year or two younger than
Nynaeve, Areina wore her dark hair in a braid patterned after
Birgitte&rsquo;s golden one, though still little below her
shoulders; Birgitte&rsquo;s hung properly to the waist. Her clothes
copied Birgitte, too, a waist-length coat of pale gray, and
voluminous bronze-colored trousers, gathered at the ankle above
short boots with raised heels, as did the bow she carried and the
quiver at her waist. Nynaeve did not think Areina had ever held a
bow before meeting Birgitte. She ignored the woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need to talk to you,&rdquo; she told Birgitte.
 &ldquo;Alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Areina glanced at her, blue eyes close to contempt.
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;d think you&rsquo;d be wearing your shawl this fine day,
Nynaeve. Oh, my. You seem to be sweating like a horse. Why is
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s face tightened. She had befriended
the woman before Birgitte had, but the friendship melted on
reaching Salidar. Learning that Nynaeve was not full Aes Sedai
brought something more than disappointment. Only a request from
Birgitte had held Areina back from informing the Aes Sedai that she
had masqueraded as one. Besides, Areina had taken the oaths as a
Hunter for the Horn, and Birgitte was certainly a better model for
that life than Nynaeve. To think she had once pitied the woman her
bruises!</p>

<p>&ldquo;From your face,&rdquo; Birgitte said with a sweaty grin,
 &ldquo;either you&rsquo;re ready to strangle somebody&mdash;probably
Areina here&mdash;or else your dress fell off in the middle of a
pack of soldiers and you weren&rsquo;t wearing a shift.&rdquo; Areina
snorted a laugh, but she looked shocked. Why she should, Nynaeve
did not know; the woman had had plenty of time to become used to
Birgitte&rsquo;s so-called sense of humor, more suited as it was to
some unshaven man with his nose in a mug and his belly full of
ale.</p>

<p>Nynaeve studied the boys&rsquo; play for a minute to
give her irritation a chance to die down. Worse than useless to let
herself get angry when she had a favor to ask.</p>

<p>Seve and Jaril were among the boys dodging and
tossing the bag. The Yellows had been right about them; time was
what they had needed. After close to two months in Salidar with
other children and no fear, they laughed and shouted as loudly as
the rest.</p>

<p>A sudden thought hit her like a hammer. &ldquo;Marigan&rdquo;
still looked after them, if grudgingly, saw that they were bathed
and fed, but now that they were talking again, at any time they
might tell that the woman was not their mother. Perhaps they
already had. That might not cause questions, but then again it
might, and questions could bring the house of twigs they had built
tumbling down on their heads. The ball of ice reappeared in the pit
of Nynaeve&rsquo;s belly. Why had she not thought of this
before?</p>

<p>She gave a start as Birgitte touched her arm. &ldquo;What
is wrong, Nynaeve? You look as though your best friend died and
cursed you with her last breath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Areina was striding away, stiff-backed, casting one
look over her shoulder at them. The woman could watch Birgitte
drink and flirt with men without turning a hair, and even try to
emulate her, yet she bristled every time Birgitte wanted to be
alone with Elayne or Nynaeve. Men were no threat; only women could
be friends in Areina&rsquo;s book, but only she could be
Birgitte&rsquo;s friend. The idea of having two friends seemed
foreign to her. Well, enough and be done with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you get horses for us?&rdquo; Nynaeve tried to
steady her voice. That was not what she had come to ask, but Seve
and Jaril made it an excellent question. &ldquo;How long will it
take?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Birgitte drew her out of the street, to the mouth of
a narrow alley between two weathered houses, and looked around
carefully before answering. No one was close enough to overhear, or
pay them any mind. &ldquo;A day or two. Uno was just telling me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not Uno! We will leave him out of this. Just you,
me, Elayne and Marigan. Unless Thom and Juilin return in time. And
Areina, I suppose, if you insist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Areina&rsquo;s a fool some ways,&rdquo; Birgitte said
slowly, &ldquo;but life will wring that out of her, or wring her out. You
know I&rsquo;d never insist on her going along if you and Elayne
don&rsquo;t want her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve kept silent. The woman was behaving as if she
was the jealous one! It was none of her affair if Birgitte wanted
to take up with somebody as fickle as Areina.</p>

<p>Rubbing a knuckle across her lips, Birgitte frowned.
 &ldquo;Thom and Juilin are good men, but the best way to avoid trouble
is to make sure no one wants to trouble you. A dozen or so
Shienarans in armor&mdash;or out&mdash;would go a long way toward
that. I don&rsquo;t understand you and Uno. He is tough, and
he&rsquo;d follow you and Elayne into the Pit of Doom.&rdquo; A sudden
grin bloomed on her face. &ldquo;Besides, he&rsquo;s a well-set-up
fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not need anyone to hold our hands,&rdquo; Nynaeve
told her stiffly. Well set up? That painted eyepatch flashed
queasily across her mind, and the scars. The woman had the
strangest taste in men. &ldquo;We can handle anything that comes our way.
I&rsquo;d think we&rsquo;ve already proved that, if it needed
proof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know we can, Nynaeve, but we&rsquo;ll draw trouble
like flies to a midden. Altara&rsquo;s at a slow boil. Every day
brings another tale of Dragonsworn, and I&rsquo;ll wager my best
silk dress against one of your old shifts that half of them are
really just brigands who&rsquo;ll see four women alone as easy meat.
We will have to prove we&rsquo;re not every second day.
Murandy&rsquo;s worse, I hear, full of Dragonsworn and bandits and
refugees from Cairhien, afraid the Dragon Reborn will fall on them
any day. I assume you don&rsquo;t mean to cross over into Amadicia.
I assume it&rsquo;s Caemlyn.&rdquo; Her intricate braid swung slightly as
she tilted her head and raised a questioning eyebrow. &ldquo;Does Elayne
agree with you about Uno?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will,&rdquo; Nynaeve muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. Well, when she does, I will procure as many
horses as we need. But I want her to tell me why we should not take
Uno.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The unyielding finality of her tone heated
Nynaeve&rsquo;s face angrily. If she did ask Elayne ever so sweetly
to tell Birgitte that Uno was to stay here, they might well find
him waiting down the road, and Birgitte all amazement over how he
knew they were going and which way. The woman might be
Elayne&rsquo;s Warder, but sometimes Nynaeve wondered which of them
was really in charge. When she found Lan&mdash;when, not
if!&mdash;she intended to make him swear oaths fit to curl
his hair that he would abide by her decisions.</p>

<p>She drew deep calming breaths. No point arguing with
a stone wall. She might as well get on to the reason she had hunted
up Birgitte in the first place.</p>

<p>Casually she took a step deeper into the narrow
alley, making the other woman follow. Brown stubble remained
underfoot from the brush that had been cleared out of it. Trying to
appear offhanded, she studied the press in the street. Still no one
giving them more than a glance. She lowered her voice anyway. &ldquo;We
need to know what Tarna is telling the Hall, and what they&rsquo;re
telling her. Elayne and I have tried to find out, but they ward the
meetings against eavesdropping. Only with the Power, though.
They&rsquo;re so caught up that someone can listen in that way, they
seem to have forgotten about pressing an ear to a door. If someone
were to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Birgitte cut her off in a flat voice. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least consider it. Elayne or I are ten times as
likely to be caught as you.&rdquo; She thought of adding that Elayne was
rather clever, but the other woman sniffed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said no! You&rsquo;ve been many things since
I&rsquo;ve known you, Nynaeve, but never silly. Light, they&rsquo;ll
announce it to everyone in a day or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need to know now,&rdquo; Nynaeve hissed, swallowing.
 &ldquo;You man-brained idiot.&rdquo; Silly? Of course she had never been silly!
She must not be angry. If she could convince Elayne to go, they
might not be here in a day or two. Best not to open that bag of
snakes again.</p>

<p>Shuddering&mdash;a touch ostentatiously, Nynaeve
thought&mdash;Birgitte leaned on her bow. &ldquo;I was caught spying on
Aes Sedai once. They tossed me out on my ear three days later, and
I left Shaemal as fast as I could reach a horse. I will not go
through that to gain you a day you don&rsquo;t need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve remained calm. She made an effort to maintain
a smooth face, to not grind her teeth, to not yank her braid. She
was calm. &ldquo;I never heard any story about you spying on Aes Sedai.&rdquo;
As soon as the words were out of her mouth, she wanted them back.
The core of Birgitte&rsquo;s secret was that she was the Birgitte in
the stories. Nothing that made that connection was ever to be
mentioned.</p>

<p>For a moment Birgitte&rsquo;s face was stone, hiding
everything inside. It was enough to make Nynaeve shiver; there was
too much pain wrapped in the other woman&rsquo;s secret. Finally
stone became flesh once more, and Birgitte sighed. &ldquo;Time changes
things. I hardly recognize half those tales myself, and the other
half not at all. We&rsquo;ll not speak of it again.&rdquo; That was very
plainly not a suggestion.</p>

<p>Nynaeve opened her mouth with no clear idea of what
to say&mdash;her own debt to Birgitte meant she did not want to
poke at the woman&rsquo;s pain, but to be balked over two simple
requests&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&mdash;and a third woman&rsquo;s voice spoke
suddenly from the mouth of the alley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve, Janya and Delana want you right this
minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve tried to climb straight up into the air; her
heart tried to climb through the roof of her mouth.</p>

<p>In the mouth of the alley, novice-clad Nicola looked
startled for a moment. So did Birgitte; then she studied her bow,
looking amused.</p>

<p>Nynaeve had to swallow twice before she could force a
word out. How much had the woman heard? &ldquo;If you think that&rsquo;s
any way to speak to an Accepted, Nicola, you had best learn better
quickly, or you will be taught.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a properly Aes Sedai thing to say, but the
slender woman&rsquo;s dark eyes surveyed Nynaeve, weighing and
measuring. &ldquo;I am sorry, Accepted,&rdquo; she said, curtsying. &ldquo;I will try
to be more careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The curtsy was just exactly deep enough for an
Accepted, to the inch, and if the tone was cool, it was not cool
enough to call her down for. Areina had not been the only traveling
companion disappointed by learning the truth about Elayne and
Nynaeve, but Nicola had agreed to keep the secret as if surprised
they thought they had to ask. Then, after testing revealed she
could learn to channel, the weighing and measuring entered her
eyes.</p>

<p>Nynaeve understood all too well. Nicola lacked the
inborn spark&mdash;without teaching, she would never have touched
<em>saidar</em>&mdash;but already her promise was spoken of, the
strength she would have one day if she applied herself. Two years
earlier, with more potential than any novice in centuries, she
would have caused real excitement. That was before Elayne and
Egwene, and Nynaeve herself, though. Nicola never said anything,
yet Nynaeve was certain she was determined to match Elayne and
Nynaeve, if not better them. She never stepped over the line of
propriety, but she often walked it.</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave her a sharp nod. Understanding did not
stop her wanting to dose the fool woman with triple-strength
sheepstongue root for pure idiocy. &ldquo;See that you do. Go tell the
Aes Sedai I will be with them in just a few moments.&rdquo; Nicola
curtsied again, but as she turned away, Nynaeve said, &ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; The
woman stopped immediately. It was not there now, but for an instant
Nynaeve had been sure she saw a flash of&mdash;satisfaction? &ldquo;Did
you tell me everything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was sent to tell you to come, Accepted, and I
did.&rdquo; Bland as water a week in the pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did they say? Their exact words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exact words, Accepted? I don&rsquo;t know that I can
remember their <em>exact</em> words, but I&rsquo;ll try. Remember it
was them who said it; I&rsquo;m only repeating. Janya Sedai said
something like, &lsquo;If that fool girl doesn&rsquo;t show up soon,
I vow she won&rsquo;t be able to sit down comfortably until
she&rsquo;s old enough to be a grandmother.&rsquo; And Delana Sedai
said, &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll be that old before she decides to appear.
If she isn&rsquo;t here inside the quarter hour, I will turn her
hide into dust rags.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Her eyes were innocence itself. &ldquo;That
was about twenty minutes ago, Accepted. Maybe a little longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve very nearly swallowed again. Just because Aes
Sedai could not lie did not mean every threat had to be taken
literally, but sometimes a sparrow would starve on the difference.
With anybody but Nicola, she would have yelped &ldquo;Oh, Light!&rdquo; and
scurried. Not under those eyes. Not in front of a woman who seemed
to be storing up a list of her weaknesses. &ldquo;In that case, I suppose
there&rsquo;s no need for you to run ahead of me. Go on about your
duties.&rdquo; Turning her back on Nicola&rsquo;s curtsy as if she had no
care in the world, she spoke to Birgitte. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk with you
later. I suggest you do nothing about the matter until then.&rdquo; With
luck that might keep her away from Uno. With a great deal of
luck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will consider your suggestion,&rdquo; Birgitte said
gravely, but there was nothing grave about the mixture of sympathy
and amusement on her face. The woman knew Aes Sedai. In some ways,
she knew more about Aes Sedai than any Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to accept and hope. As
Nynaeve started up the street, Nicola fell in beside her. &ldquo;I told
you to be about your duties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They said to come back when I found you, Accepted.
Is that one of your herbs? Why do you use herbs? Is it because you
can&rsquo;t&mdash;? Forgive me, Accepted. I should not have
mentioned that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve blinked at the sack of goosemint in her hand&mdash;she did not remember taking it out&mdash;and stuffed it
back in her pouch. She wanted to chew the whole sackful of leaves.
She ignored the apology and its cause; one was surely as false as
the other was deliberate. &ldquo;I use herbs because Healing isn&rsquo;t
always necessary.&rdquo; Would the Yellows disapprove if that got back to
them? They were contemptuous of herbs; they only seemed interested
in illnesses that did need Healing. Or those where it was not
cracking pecans with a sledgehammer, anyway. What was she doing
worrying over what she said to Nicola in case it should be carried
to Aes Sedai? The woman was a novice, no matter how she looked at
her and Elayne. It did not matter how she looked at them. &ldquo;Keep
quiet,&rdquo; she said irritably. &ldquo;I want to think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nicola did keep quiet as they wended their way
through the crowded streets, but it seemed to Nynaeve that the
woman&rsquo;s steps dragged. Perhaps it was only imagination, but
Nynaeve&rsquo;s knees began to ache from the effort of not outpacing
her. Under no circumstances would she let Nicola see her even
appear to hurry.</p>

<p>The situation set a slow burn inside her. Of
everybody who could have been sent to fetch her, it was hard to
imagine anyone worse than Nicola and her eyes. Birgitte was
probably running off to find Uno right that minute. The Sitters
were probably telling Tarna they were ready to kneel and kiss
Elaida&rsquo;s ring. Seve and Jaril were probably telling Sheriam
they did not know &ldquo;Marigan&rdquo; from a wild goose. It had been that
kind of day, and the molten sun stood only a quarter toward its
peak in the cloudless sky.</p>

<p>Janya and Delana were waiting in the front room of
the small house they shared with three other Aes Sedai. Each with
her own bedroom, of course. Each Ajah had a house for its meetings,
but Aes Sedai were scattered about through the village depending on
when they had come in. Frowning at the floor, lips pursed, Janya
appeared unaware of their arrival. Pale-haired Delana, though&mdash;her hair was so fair there was no telling whether there was
white in it or not&mdash;Delana focused her equally pale blue eyes
on them as soon as they set foot inside the door. Nicola jumped.
Nynaeve would have felt better about that had she not done the
same. Usually the stout Gray&rsquo;s eyes were no different from any
other Aes Sedai&rsquo;s, but when she really focused on you, it was
as if nothing else existed but you. Some said Delana was successful
as a mediator because both sides would agree just to make her stop
staring at them. You started thinking of what you had done wrong
even if you had done nothing. The list that popped into
Nynaeve&rsquo;s head made her curtsy as deeply as Nicola before she
knew it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Janya said, blinking as if they had sprung out
of the floor, &ldquo;there you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me for being late,&rdquo; Nynaeve said hastily.
Let Nicola hear whatever she wanted. Delana was staring at her, not
Nicola. &ldquo;I lost track of the time, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter.&rdquo; Delana&rsquo;s voice was deep for a
woman, her accent a throaty echo of Uno&rsquo;s Shienaran. It was
oddly melodious in such a round woman, but then Delana was oddly
graceful for one so stout. &ldquo;Nicola, be off with you. You&rsquo;ll be
running errands for Faolain until your next lesson.&rdquo; Nicola wasted
no time dropping another curtsy and darting out. Maybe she had
wanted to hear what the Aes Sedai said to Nynaeve for being late,
but no one walked any lines with Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>Nynaeve would not have cared if Nicola sprouted
wings. She had just realized there was no inkpot on the table where
the Aes Sedai took their meals, no sand bowl, no pen, no paper.
None of what she would need. Had she been supposed to bring it?
Delana was <em>still</em> staring at her. The woman <em>never</em>
stared at anyone that long. She never stared at all unless she had
a reason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like cool mint tea?&rdquo; Janya said, and it
was Nynaeve&rsquo;s turn to blink. &ldquo;I do think tea is comforting. It
smooths conversation, I always find.&rdquo; Not waiting for an answer,
the bird-like Brown sister began filling mismatched cups from a
blue-striped teapot on the sideboard. A rock stood in place of one
of the sideboard&rsquo;s legs. Aes Sedai might have more room, but
their furnishings were just as battered. &ldquo;Delana and I decided our
notes could wait for another time. We will just talk, instead.
Honey? I prefer it without, myself. All that sweetness ruins the
flavor. Young women always want their honey. Such wonderful things
you&rsquo;ve been doing. You and Elayne.&rdquo; A loud throat-clearing
made her look at Delana questioningly. After a moment Janya said,
 &ldquo;Ah. Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Delana had pulled one of the chairs from the table
into the middle of the bare floor. One cane-bottomed chair. From
the moment Janya mentioned conversation Nynaeve had known that that
was not at all what was going to happen. Delana motioned to the
chair, and Nynaeve took a seat on the very edge of it, accepted a
cup on a chipped saucer from Janya with a murmured &ldquo;Thank you, Aes
Sedai.&rdquo; She did not have long to wait.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us about Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; Janya said. She
appeared ready to say more, but Delana cleared her throat again;
Janya blinked and fell silent, sipping her tea. They stood to
either side of Nynaeve&rsquo;s chair. Delana glanced at her, then
sighed and channeled the third cup to herself. It floated across
the room. Delana fixed on her again in that way that seemed to bore
holes in your head, Janya apparently lost in thought and maybe not
seeing her at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you everything I know,&rdquo; Nynaeve
sighed. &ldquo;Well, told Aes Sedai, anyway.&rdquo; She had, too. Nothing she
knew could harm him&mdash;not any more than knowing what he was,
anyway&mdash;and it might help if she could make the sisters see
him as a man. Not a man who could channel; just a man. Not an easy
task with the Dragon Reborn. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sulk,&rdquo; Delana snapped. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t
fidget.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve set her cup back in the saucer and wiped her
wrist on her skirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Child,&rdquo; Janya said, her tone all compassion, &ldquo;I know
you think you&rsquo;ve told all you know, but Delana&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I cannot
think you would hold back on purpose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why would she not?&rdquo; Delana barked. &ldquo;Born in the same
village. Watched him grow up. Her loyalties may be more to him than
to the White Tower.&rdquo; That razor gaze descended on Nynaeve again.
 &ldquo;Tell us something you haven&rsquo;t told before. I&rsquo;ve heard
all your stories, girl, so I will know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try, child. I&rsquo;m sure you don&rsquo;t want to
make Delana angry with you. Why&mdash;&rdquo; Janya cut off at another
throat-clearing.</p>

<p>Nynaeve hoped they thought her teacup rattling meant
she was rattled as well. Dragged here terrified&mdash;no, not terrified,
but worried at least&mdash;over how angry they might be, and now
this. Being around Aes Sedai taught you to listen carefully. You
still might not catch what they really meant, but you had a better
chance than if you listened with half an ear, the way most people
usually did. Neither one had really said they thought she was
keeping anything back. They just intended to frighten her on the
chance that they might shake something else loose. She was not
afraid of them. Well, not much. She was furious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When he was a boy,&rdquo; she said carefully, &ldquo;he would
accept his punishment without any argument if he thought he
deserved it, but if he didn&rsquo;t think so, he fought every step
of the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Delana snorted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told that to everyone
who would listen. Something else. Quickly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can lead him, or convince him, but he won&rsquo;t
be pushed. He digs in his heels if he thinks you&rsquo;re&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that.&rdquo; Hands on broad hips, Delana bent down
until her head was level with Nynaeve&rsquo;s. Nynaeve almost wished
she had Nicola staring at her again. &ldquo;Something you&rsquo;ve not
told every cook and laundress in Salidar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do try, child,&rdquo; Janya said, and for a wonder left it
at that.</p>

<p>They dug away, Janya prompting sympathetically,
Delana boring without mercy, and Nynaeve brought up every scrap she
could remember. It earned her no respite; every scrap had been told
so many times before she could identify them by taste. As Delana
kindly pointed out. Well, not so kindly. By the time Nynaeve
managed to take a sip of her tea, it tasted stale, and the
sweetness almost curled her tongue. Janya apparently really did
believe young women liked lots of honey. The morning passed slowly.
Very slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is taking us nowhere,&rdquo; Delana said at last,
glaring at Nynaeve as if it were all her fault.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I go then?&rdquo; Nynaeve asked wearily. Every drop of
sweat that drenched her seemed to have been squeezed out. She felt
limp. She also wanted to slap both those cool Aes Sedai faces.</p>

<p>Delana and Janya exchanged glances. The Gray shrugged
and walked over to the sideboard for another cup of tea. &ldquo;Of course
you may,&rdquo; Janya said. &ldquo;I know this must have been difficult for
you, but we really do need to know Rand al&rsquo;Thor better than he
knows himself if we are to decide what&rsquo;s best. Otherwise,
everything could turn to catastrophe. Oh, my, yes. You&rsquo;ve done
very well, child. But then, I never expected any less of you.
Anyone who can make the discoveries you&rsquo;ve made, with your
handicap&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;why, I expect nothing less than excellence from you.
And to think&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took quite a while for her to run down and let
Nynaeve stagger outside. Stagger she did, on wobbly knees.
Everybody was talking about her. Of course they were. She should
have listened to Elayne and begun leaving all the so-called
discoveries to her. Moghedien was right. Sooner or later they were
going to start probing for how she did it. So they had to decide
what was best, to avoid catastrophe. No clue there to what they
intended toward Rand.</p>

<p>A glance at the sun, almost overhead, told her she
was already late for her appointment with Theodrin. At least she
had a good excuse this time.</p>

<p>Theodrin&rsquo;s house&mdash;hers and two dozen other
women&rsquo;s&mdash;lay beyond the Little Tower. Nynaeve slowed as
she came abreast of the onetime inn. The gaggle of Warders out
front near Gareth Bryne were evidence the meeting still went on. A
residue of anger enabled her to see the ward, a close flat dome
mostly of Fire and Air with touches of Water, shimmering to her
eyes over the entire building, the knot holding it in tantalizing
fashion. Touching that knot would be as good as offering her hide
to a tannery; there were plenty of Aes Sedai in the crowded street.
Now and then some of the Warders moved back and forth through the
shimmer, invisible to them, as one group broke up and another
formed. The same ward Elayne had failed to penetrate. A shield
against eavesdropping. With the Power.</p>

<p>Theodrin&rsquo;s house stood a hundred paces or so
farther up the street, but Nynaeve turned into the yard beside a
thatch-roofed house just two beyond the former inn. A rickety
wooden fence enclosed the tiny plot of withered weeds behind the
house, but it had a gate, hanging on one hinge that was nearly all
rust. It squealed murderously when she shifted the gate. She looked
around hastily&mdash;no one at any of the windows; no one in the
street could see her&mdash;gathered her skirts and darted through
into the narrow alleyway that eventually ran by the room she shared
with Elayne.</p>

<p>For a moment she hesitated, wiping sweaty palms on
her dress, remembering what Birgitte had said. She knew she was a
coward at heart, much as she hated the fact. Once she had thought
herself brave enough. Not a hero, like Birgitte, but brave enough.
The world had taught her better. Just thinking of what the
sisters would do if they caught her&mdash;made her want to turn
around and run to Theodrin. The chance was vanishingly small that
she could actually find a window on the very room where the Sitters
were. Impossibly small.</p>

<p>Trying to work some moisture back into her mouth&mdash;how could her mouth be so dry when the rest of her was so
damp?&mdash;she crept closer. One day she wanted to know what it
was like to be brave, like Birgitte or Elayne, instead of a
coward.</p>

<p>The ward did not tingle when she stepped through. It
did not feel like anything at all. She had known it would not.
Touching it could do no harm, but she flattened herself against the
rough stone wall. Bits of creeper clinging to its cracks brushed
her face.</p>

<p>Slowly she edged along to the nearest casement window&mdash;and nearly turned around and left right then. It was shut
tight, all the glass gone, replaced by oiled cloth that might let
in light but certainly did not allow her to see anything. Or hear
anything; at least, if there was anybody on the other side, no
noise escaped. Taking a deep breath, she inched to the next window.
One pane had been replaced here too, but the remainder showed a
battered once-ornate table covered with papers and inkpots, a few
chairs, and an otherwise empty room.</p>

<p>Muttering a curse she had heard from Elayne&mdash;the girl had a surprising stock of such tucked away&mdash;she felt
her way along the rough stone. The third window was swung out. She
pressed her nose close. And jerked back. She had not really
believed she would find anything, but Tarna was in there. Not with
Sitters, but Sheriam and Myrelle and the rest of that lot. If her
heart had not been pounding so hard, she would have heard the
murmur of their voices before she looked.</p>

<p>Kneeling down, she moved as close to the casement as
she could without being seen by those inside. The bottom of the
window rubbed against her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;sure that is the message you wish me to carry
back?&rdquo; That steely voice had to be Tarna&rsquo;s. &ldquo;You request more
time to consider? What is there to consider?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Hall&mdash;&rdquo; Sheriam began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>Hall</em>,&rdquo; the Tower envoy scoffed. &ldquo;Do not
believe me blind to where power lies. That so-called <em>Hall</em>
thinks what you six tell them to think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Hall, it has asked for more time,&rdquo; Beonin said
firmly. &ldquo;Who can say what decision they will reach?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elaida will have to wait to hear their decision,&rdquo;
Morvrin said in a fair imitation of Tarna&rsquo;s icy tone. &ldquo;Can she
not wait a small time to see the White Tower whole once more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tarna&rsquo;s reply was even colder, though. &ldquo;I will
carry your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the <em>Hall&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;message to the
Amyrlin. We shall see what she thinks of it.&rdquo; A door opened and
closed with a sharp bang.</p>

<p>Nynaeve could have screamed with frustration. Now she
knew the answer, but not the question. If only Janya and Delana had
released her a little sooner. Well, it was better than nothing.
Better than &ldquo;We will return and obey Elaida.&rdquo; There was no point
staying here, waiting for someone to look out and see her.</p>

<p>She started to ease away, and Myrelle said, &ldquo;Perhaps
we should just send a message. Perhaps we should simply summon
her.&rdquo; Frowning, Nynaeve held her place. Her who?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The forms must be met,&rdquo; Morvrin said gruffly. &ldquo;The
proper ceremonies must be followed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beonin spoke on her heels in firm tones. &ldquo;We must
meet every letter of the law. The smallest slip, it will be used
against us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if we have made a mistake?&rdquo; Carlinya sounded
heated for perhaps the first time in her life. &ldquo;How long are we to
wait? How long dare we wait?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as need be,&rdquo; Morvrin said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as we must.&rdquo; That from Beonin. &ldquo;I have not
waited this long for the biddable child just to abandon all our
plans now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For some reason that produced a silence, although
Nynaeve did hear someone murmur &ldquo;biddable&rdquo; again as if examining
the word. What child? A novice or Accepted? It made no sense.
Sisters <em>never</em> waited on novices or Accepted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have gone too far to turn back, Carlinya,&rdquo;
Sheriam said finally. &ldquo;Either we bring her here and make sure she
does as she should, or we leave everything to the Hall and hope
they do not lead us all to disaster.&rdquo; From her tone, she considered
that last a hope for fools.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One slip,&rdquo; Carlinya said coldly, even more coldly
than usual, &ldquo;and we will all end with our heads on pikes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who will put them there?&rdquo; Anaiya asked
thoughtfully. &ldquo;Elaida, the Hall, or Rand al&rsquo;Thor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence stretched, the skirts rustled, and the door
opened and closed once more.</p>

<p>Nynaeve risked a peek. The room was empty. She made a
vexed sound. That they intended to wait was small consolation; the
final answer could still be anything. Anaiya&rsquo;s comment showed
they were still as wary of Rand as of Elaida. Maybe more. Elaida
was not gathering men who could channel. And who was the &ldquo;biddable
child&rdquo;? No, that was unimportant. They could have fifty schemes
weaving she knew nothing about.</p>

<p>The ward winked out, and Nynaeve jumped. It was past
time to be gone from here. Scrambling to her feet, she began
dusting her knees vigorously as she stepped away from the wall. One
step was all she took. She stopped, bent over with her hands frozen
over the dirty spots on her dress, staring at Theodrin.</p>

<p>The apple-cheeked Domani woman met her gaze, not
saying a word.</p>

<p>Hastily Nynaeve considered and rejected the fool
claim that she had been searching for something she dropped.
Instead she straightened and walked slowly by the other woman as if
there was nothing to explain. Theodrin fell in beside her silently,
hands folded at her waist. Nynaeve considered her options. She
could hit Theodrin over the head and run. She could get back on her
knees and plead. Both notions had a good deal wrong with them to
her way of thinking, but she could not pull up anything in
between.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been keeping calm?&rdquo; Theodrin asked, looking
straight ahead.</p>

<p>Nynaeve gave a start. That had been the other
woman&rsquo;s instruction to her after yesterday&rsquo;s attempt to
break down her block. Keep calm, very calm; think only quiet
composed thoughts. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she laughed weakly. &ldquo;What could
there be to upset me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rsquo;That is good,&rdquo; Theodrin said serenely. &ldquo;Today I
mean to try something a little more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;direct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve glanced at her. No questions? No accusations?
The way this day had been going she could not believe she was
getting off so lightly.</p>

<p>Neither saw the woman watching them from a
second-story window.</p>
