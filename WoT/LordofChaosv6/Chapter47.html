<h4><em>The Wandering Woman</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">M</span>at
wanted a quiet ride to Ebou Dar, and he got one,
in a way. But traveling with six women, four of them Aes Sedai, he
had plenty of irritations.</p>

<p>They reached the distant forest that first day with
the sun still fairly well up in the sky, and rode several hours
beneath a high canopy of mostly bare branches, with dead leaves and
dry branches crunching under the horses&rsquo; hooves, until making
camp near a dwindling stream just before sunset. Lantern-jawed
Harnan, the file leader with the hawk tattooed on his cheek, saw to
getting the troopers from the Band settled, the horses curried and
hobbled, sentries set and fires lit. Nerim and Lopin bustled about
moaning over not having brought tents, and how was a man to know
they would be spending nights on the ground when his master said
nothing, and if his master caught his death of something, it was
not his fault. Skinny and stout, they managed to sound like echoes.
Vanin took care of himself, of course, though he did keep an eye on
Olver and even curried the parts of Wind that the boy could not
reach even using his saddle for a stool. Everybody took care of
Olver.</p>

<p>The women shared the camp, but in a way their area
was as separate as if it had been fifty paces away. An invisible
line seemed to split the campsite in half, with invisible signs
telling the troopers not to cross. Nynaeve and Elayne and the two
white-haired women gathered around their own fire with Aviendha and
the golden-haired Hunter, rarely even glancing toward where Mat and
his men were laying out their blankets. The murmured conversation
Mat heard, as much as he could make out, had to do with Vandene and
Adeleas&rsquo; concern that Aviendha meant to lead her horse all the
way to Ebou Dar instead of riding. Thom tried to get a word in with
Elayne and received an absent pat on the cheek, of all things,
before he was sent back to sit with Juilin and Jaem, the stringy
old Warder, who belonged to Vandene and seemed to spend all of his
time sharpening his sword.</p>

<p>Mat had no objection to the women staying apart. A
tension he could not understand hung around them. At least, it did
around Nynaeve and Elayne, and the Hunter seemed to be infected
too. They sometimes stared at the Aes Sedai&mdash;the other Aes
Sedai; he was not sure he would ever become used to thinking of
Nynaeve and Elayne that way&mdash;a bit too intently, though
Vandene and Adeleas appeared as oblivious as Aviendha. Whatever the
reason, Mat wanted no part of it. It smelled like an argument
burning to leap out, and whether it burst into flame or smoldered
underground, a wise man stepped wide of women&rsquo;s arguments.
Medallion or no medallion, a wise man stepped very wide if the
women were Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>A small irritant that, and so was the next, which was
his own fault. Food. The smell of lamb and some sort of soup
quickly wafted from the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s fire. Expecting a quick
arrival in Ebou Dar, he had said nothing about food to Vanin and
the others, which meant they had a little dried meat and hard cakes
of flatbread in their saddlebags. Mat had seen hardly a bird or
squirrel, let alone sign of a deer, so hunting was out of the
question. When Nerim set up a small folding table and stool for Mat&mdash;Lopin was putting up another for Nalesean&mdash;Mat told
him to share out what he had tucked away in the packhorses&rsquo;
panniers. The result was not as good as he hoped.</p>

<p>Nerim stood by Mat&rsquo;s table, pouring water from a
silver pitcher as if it were wine and mournfully watching
delicacies vanish down the trooper&rsquo;s gullets. &ldquo;Pickled quail
eggs, my Lord,&rdquo; he would announce in a funereal tone. &ldquo;They would
have gone very well for my Lord&rsquo;s breakfast in Ebou Dar.&rdquo; And,
 &ldquo;The best smoked tongue, my Lord. If my Lord only knew what I went
through to find honey-smoked tongue in that wretched village, with
no time to find anything and all the best taken by the Aes Sedai.&rdquo;
Actually, his biggest grievance seemed to be that Lopin had found
potted larks for Nalesean. Every time Nalesean crunched one between
his teeth, Lopin&rsquo;s smug smile grew wider and Nerim&rsquo;s face
grew longer. For that matter, it was plain from the way some of the
men sniffed the air that they would rather have had a slice of lamb
and a bowl of soup than any amount of honey-smoked tongue or
goose-liver pudding. Olver stared at the women&rsquo;s fire with
open wistfulness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to eat with them?&rdquo; Mat asked him.
 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, if you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like kippered eel,&rdquo; Olver said stoutly. In a
darker tone, he added, &ldquo;Anyway, she might put something in it.&rdquo; His
eyes followed Aviendha every time she shifted, and he seemed to
have taken against the Hunter too, perhaps because she spent a good
bit of time in obviously friendly chat with the Aiel woman.
Aviendha at least must have felt the boy&rsquo;s stare, because she
glanced at him and frowned.</p>

<p>Wiping his chin and eyeing the Aes Sedai&rsquo;s fire&mdash;come to think of it, he would rather have had lamb and soup
himself&mdash;Mat noticed that Jaem was missing. Vanin grumped
about being sent out again, but Mat sent him for the same reason he
had had the man scout ahead during the day despite the fact that
Jaem did too. He did not want to rely on what the Aes Sedai chose
to tell him. He might have trusted Nynaeve&mdash;he did not think
she would actually lie to him; as Wisdom, Nynaeve had always been
death on anyone lying&mdash;but she kept peeping at him past
Adeleas&rsquo; shoulder in a very suspicious way.</p>

<p>To his surprise, Elayne rose as soon as she finished
eating and came gliding across that invisible line. Some women just
seemed to skim over the ground. &ldquo;Will you walk aside with me,
Master Cauthon?&rdquo; she asked coolly. Not polite, exactly, but not
exactly rude either.</p>

<p>He motioned her to lead the way, and she floated out
into the moon-shadowed trees beyond the sentries. That golden hair
nestled about her shoulders, framing a face to make any man
stare, and the moonlight softened her arrogance. If she had been
anything but what she was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and he did not mean just Aes Sedai,
nor even that she belonged to Rand. Rand did seem to be tangling
himself with the worst sort of woman for a man who had always known
how to handle them. Then Elayne began talking, and he forgot
everything else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>,&rdquo; she said
without preamble, and without looking at him. She just glided
along, rustling the leaves on the ground, as if she expected him to
heel like a hunting hound. &ldquo;Some hold that <em>
ter</em>&rsquo;<em>angreal</em> are rightfully the property of Aes
Sedai, but I do not require you to surrender it. No one will take
it from you. Such things need study, however. For that reason, I
want you to give the <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> to me each evening
when we stop. I will return it each morning before we start
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat gave her a sidelong look. She was serious, no
doubt about it. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very kind of you, letting me keep
what&rsquo;s mine. Only, what makes you think I have one of these&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;what did you call it? A ter-something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh, she did stiffen up at that, and looked at him
too. He was surprised not to see fire leap from her eyes to light
up the night. Her voice, on the other hand, was purest crystal ice.
 &ldquo;You know very <em>well</em> what a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> is,
Master Cauthon. I heard Moiraine speak of them to you in the Stone
of Tear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Stone?&rdquo; he said blandly. &ldquo;Yes, I remember the
Stone. A fine time we all had there. Do you remember something in
the Stone that gives you a right to make demands of me? I
don&rsquo;t. I am just here to keep you and Nynaeve from getting
holes poked in your hides in Ebou Dar. You can ask Rand about <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> after I deliver you to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a long moment she stared at him as though meaning
to beat him down by force of will, then turned on her heel without
another word. He followed her back to the camp and was surprised to
see her walk along the line of hobbled horses. She examined the
fires and how the blankets were laid out, shook her head over the
remains of the troopers&rsquo; meal. He had no idea what she was
about until she returned to him with her chin raised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your men have done very well, Master Cauthon,&rdquo; she
said, loud enough for everyone to hear. &ldquo;In general I am more than
satisfied. But if you had planned ahead properly, they would not
have had to gorge themselves on foods that will at the very least
keep them awake tonight. Still, on the whole, you have done well.
I&rsquo;m sure you will think ahead in future.&rdquo; Cool as you please
she strode back to her own fire before he could say a word, leaving
him staring.</p>

<p>Had that been the whole of it, though, the bloody
Daughter-Heir thinking he was one of her subjects, and her and
Nynaeve tight-lipped around Vandene and Adeleas&mdash;had that
been all, he would have danced a jig. Right after Elayne&rsquo;s
 &ldquo;inspection,&rdquo; before he could even reach his blankets, the foxhead
went cold.</p>

<p>He was so shocked that he stood there staring down at
his chest before he even thought to look toward the Aes
Sedai&rsquo;s fire. There they stood in a row along that unseen
dividing line, Aviendha as well. Elayne murmured something he could
not make out and the two white-haired Aes Sedai nodded, Adeleas all
the while hastily dipping a pen in an inkjar in a sort of scabbard
at her belt and jotting notes in a small book. Nynaeve was tugging
her braid and muttering to herself.</p>

<p>It only lasted a few moments altogether. Then the
chill faded, and they returned to their fire talking softly among
themselves. Now and then one of them would glance in his direction
until he finally bedded himself down.</p>

<p>The second day they joined a road, and Jaem put his
color-shifting cloak away. It was a broad stretch of hard-packed
dirt where sometimes an edge of old paving stone still showed, but
the highway did not make travel that much faster. For one thing,
it curved through increasingly hilly forest. Some of those hills
deserved the name of small mountain at least, jagged things with
sheer cliffs and stony spires sticking up through the trees. For
another, a thin yet steady stream of people drifted in both
directions, mostly clumps of grubby blank-faced folk who barely
seemed to have sense to step out of the way of a farmer&rsquo;s
high-wheeled ox-cart, much less a merchant&rsquo;s train with its
canvas-topped wagons clipping along behind teams of six or eight
horses. Farmhouses and barns of pale stone appeared clinging to the
slopes of the hills, and midway through the third day, they saw the
first village of white-plastered buildings with flat roofs of pale
reddish tile.</p>

<p>The pinpricks kept up, though. Elayne continued her
evening inspections. When he told her sarcastically that he was
glad she was pleased, in the second night&rsquo;s camp beside the
road, she smiled one of those deliberate regal smiles and said,
 &ldquo;You should be, Master Cauthon,&rdquo; sounding as if he had meant every
word!</p>

<p>Once they began stopping at inns, she inspected the
horses in the stables <em>and</em> the troopers&rsquo; sleeping
places in the lofts. Asking her not to brought a coolly arched
eyebrow and no answer. Telling her not to brought not even the
eyebrow; she just plain ignored him altogether. She told him to do
things he had already decided to do&mdash;such as having all the
horses&rsquo; shoes checked at the first inn that had a farrier&mdash;and, more grating, things he would have seen to had he known
of them before her. How she discovered Tad Kandel was trying to
hide a boil on his bottom, Mat did not know, or that Lawdrin
Mendair had no fewer than five flasks of brandy secreted in his
saddlebags. Irritating did not begin to describe doing a thing
after she told him to, but Kandel&rsquo;s boil had to be lanced&mdash;some of the Band had adopted Mat&rsquo;s attitude toward
being Healed&mdash;and Mendair&rsquo;s brandy poured out, and a
dozen things more.</p>

<p>Mat almost prayed for her to tell him to do something
that did not need doing, just once, so he could tell her no.
Emphatically, absolutely, no! Another demand for the <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> would have been perfect, but she never
mentioned it again. He explained to the troopers that they had no
obligation to obey her, and he never actually caught one at it, but
they began grinning in a pleased way at her compliments on how well
they cared for their horses and puffed out their chests when she
told them they looked like good soldiers to her. The day Mat saw
Vanin knuckle his forehead to her, heard him murmur, &ldquo;Thank you, my
Lady,&rdquo; without a trace of irony, that day Mat nearly swallowed his
tongue.</p>

<p>He tried to be pleasant, but none of the women were
having any, not just Elayne. Aviendha told him that he had no
honor, of all things, and if he could not show more respect to
Elayne, she herself would undertake to teach him respect. Aviendha!
The woman he still suspected was waiting her chance to slit
Elayne&rsquo;s throat! She called Elayne her near-sister! Vandene
and Adeleas peered at him as if he were a strange bug pinned to a
board. He offered to shoot with the Hunter for coin or the fun of
it&mdash;the bow she carried must have fevered her imagination;
her name as a Hunter was Birgitte&mdash;but she just gave him a
very odd look and declined. For that matter, she stayed clear of
him after that. She stuck to Elayne&rsquo;s side like a burr except
when Elayne came near him. And Nynaeve&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All the way from Salidar she avoided him as if he
smelled bad. Their third night on the way, the first at an inn, a
little place called The Marriage Knife, Mat saw her in the
tile-roofed stable feeding a wizened carrot to her plump mare and
decided that whatever else was going on, he could at least
talk to her about Bode. It was not every day a man&rsquo;s sister
went off to become Aes Sedai, and Nynaeve would know what Bode was
facing. &ldquo;Nynaeve,&rdquo; he said, striding toward her, &ldquo;I want to talk to
you&mdash;&rdquo; He got no further.</p>

<p>She practically leaped straight up in the air, and
came down shaking a fist at him, though she immediately hid it in a
fold of her skirts. &ldquo;You leave me alone, Mat Cauthon,&rdquo; she all but
shouted. &ldquo;Do you hear me? You leave me alone!&rdquo; And she scurried
out, sidling past him and bristling so that he expected to see her
braid stand up like a cat&rsquo;s tail. After that, he not only
smelled bad, he had some sickness that was both loathsome and
catching. If he so much as tried to come near her, she hid behind
Elayne and glared at him past the other woman&rsquo;s shoulder for
all the world as if she was about to stick her tongue out at him.
Women were plain mad; that was all.</p>

<p>At least Thom and Juilin were willing to ride
alongside him during the day, whenever Elayne did not demand their
attention. She did sometimes, just to keep them away from him, he
was sure, though he could not fathom the why. Once they found inns,
the pair were more than happy to share a mug of ale or punch with
him and Nalesean of an evening. They were country common rooms,
brick-walled and quiet, where watching a brindle cat was the
entertainment and the innkeeper herself served table, inevitably a
woman with hips that looked as though a man&rsquo;s fingers might
break trying a pinch. The talk was of Ebou Dar mainly, of which
Thom knew a good deal despite never having been there. Nalesean was
more than willing to recount his one visit there as often as asked,
though he wanted to focus on duels he had seen and the gambling on
horse races. Juilin had stories from men who knew men who had been
there, if not three or four removed, that sounded beyond belief
until Thom or Nalesean confirmed them. Men fought duels over women
in Ebou bar, and <em>women</em> over <em>men</em>, and in both
cases the prize&mdash;that was the word used&mdash;agreed to go
with the winner. Men gave women a knife when they married, asking
her to use it to kill him if he displeased her&mdash;<em>
displeased</em> her!&mdash;and a woman killing a man was
considered justified unless it was proven differently. In Ebou Dar,
men walked small around women, and forced a smile at what they
would kill another man for. Elayne would love it. So would
Nynaeve.</p>

<p>Something else came out in those talks. Mat had not
imagined Nynaeve and Elayne&rsquo;s displeasure at Vandene and
Adeleas, however they tried to hide it. Nynaeve apparently
contented herself with glaring and mumbling under her breath.
Elayne did not frown or mutter, but she did continually try to take
charge; she seemed to think she was already Queen of Andor. However
many years those Aes Sedai faces hid, Vandene and Adeleas had to be
old enough to be the younger women&rsquo;s mothers if not
grandmothers. Mat would not have been surprised to learn they were
Aes Sedai when Nynaeve and Elayne were born. Even Thom could not
fathom the tension, and he did seem to comprehend a great many
things for a simple gleeman. Elayne had snapped Thom&rsquo;s nose
off and <em>told</em> him he did not understand, and could not,
when he tried to remonstrate with her gently. It seemed the two
older Aes Sedai were remarkably tolerant. Adeleas often did not
appear to register the fact when Elayne gave orders, and both she
and Vandene seemed surprised when they did notice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vandene said, &lsquo;Well, if you really want to,
child, of course we will,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Juilin muttered into his ale,
recounting one incident. &ldquo;You would think somebody who was only
Accepted just a few days ago would be pleased. Elayne&rsquo;s eyes
minded me of a winter storm. Nynaeve ground her teeth so hard, I
thought they&rsquo;d crack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were in the common room of The Marriage Knife.
Vanin and Harnan and others occupied benches at other tables,
together with a number of locals. The men were in long vests, some
bright enough for a Tinker and often with no shirt, the women in
pale dresses with deep narrow necklines, their skirts gathered up
to the knee on one side to expose petticoats colorful enough to
make the vests fade. Many of the men and all of the women wore
large hoop earrings, and on their hands usually three or four rings
sparkling with colored glass. Men and women alike fingered long
curved knives stuck through their belts and eyed the strangers
darkly. There were two merchant&rsquo;s trains from Amadicia stopped
at The Marriage Knife, but the merchants had eaten in their rooms,
and their drivers remained with the wagons. Elayne and Nynaeve and
the rest of the women were upstairs too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;different,&rdquo; Nalesean said, laughing,
in response to Juilin, though he directed the words at Mat,
fingering the point of his beard. He was not usually so stiff with
commoners, but Juilin was a Tairen commoner, and that seemed to
make a difference, especially since Juilin made a point of staring
when he spoke to him. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a peasant saying in Tear.
&lsquo;An Aes Sedai is ten women in one skin.&rsquo; Peasants have a
good bit of wisdom sometimes, burn my soul if they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least no one has done anything, shall we say,
drastic,&rdquo; Thom said, &ldquo;though I thought it was close when Elayne let
slip that she had made Birgitte her first Warder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Hunter?&rdquo; Mat exclaimed. Several of the
locals looked at him hard, and he lowered his voice. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a
Warder as well? Elayne&rsquo;s Warder?&rdquo; That certainly explained a
few things.</p>

<p>Thom and Juilin exchanged looks over the rims of
their mugs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will be gratified to know you puzzled out that
she is a Hunter for the Horn,&rdquo; Thom said, wiping ale from his
mustaches. &ldquo;Yes, she is, and a rig
