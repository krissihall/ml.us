<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ith
the Dragon Scepter across his knees, Rand
lounged on the Dragon Throne. Or made a show of lounging, at least.
Thrones were not made for relaxation, this one least of all, it
seemed, but that was only part of the difficulty. Sensing Alanna
was part too, for all that it nudged at him constantly. If he told
the Maidens, they would&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;no. How could he even think of that?
He had frightened her enough to keep her at bay; she had made no
effort to enter the Inner City. He would know if she did. No, for
the moment Alanna was less of a problem than the inadequate seat
cushion.</p>

<p>Despite the silver-worked blue coat buttoned to its
collar, the heat did not reach him&mdash;he really was getting the
way of Taim&rsquo;s trick&mdash;but if pure impatience had produced
sweat, he would have dripped as if just climbing out of a river.
Keeping cool presented no problem at all. Keeping still did. He
intended to give Elayne an Andor whole and unharmed, and this
morning would be the first real step to that. If they ever
came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and in addition,&rdquo; the tall bony man standing
before the Throne said in a near monotone, &ldquo;one thousand four
hundred twenty-three refugees from Murandy, five hundred
sixty-seven from Altara, and one hundred nine from Illian. As far
as the head count inside the city proper has gone to this date, I
hasten to add.&rdquo; The few wisps of gray hair remaining to Halwin
Norry stood up like quill pens stuck behind his ears, appropriate
since he had been Morgase&rsquo;s chief clerk. &ldquo;I have hired
twenty-three additional clerks for the enumeration, but the number
is still clearly insufficient for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stopped listening. Grateful as he was that the
man had not run away as so many others had, he was not certain
anything was real to Norry except the numbers in his ledgers. He
recited the number of deaths during the week and the price of
turnips carted in from the countryside in the same dusty tone,
arranged the daily burials of penniless friendless refugees with no
more horror and no more joy than he showed hiring masons to check
the repair of the city walls. Illian was just another land to him,
not the abode of Sammael, and Rand just another ruler.</p>

<p><em>Where are they?</em> he wondered furiously. <em>
Why hasn&rsquo;t Alanna at least tried to sidle up to me? Moiraine
would never have been frightened off so easily</em>.</p>

<p><em>Where are all the dead?</em> Lews Therin
whispered. <em>Why will they not be silent?</em></p>

<p>Rand chuckled grimly. Surely that had to be a
joke.</p>

<p>Sulin was sitting easily on her haunches to one side
of the throne&rsquo;s dais, and red-haired Urien to the other. Today
twenty <em>Aethan Dor</em>, Red Shields, waited among the Grand
Hall&rsquo;s columns with the Maidens, some wearing the red
headband. They stood or squatted or sat, some talking quietly, but
as usual looked ready to spring into action in a heartbeat, even
the Maiden and two Red Shields who were dicing. At least one pair
of eyes always seemed to be watching Norry; few Aiel trusted a
wetlander this close to Rand.</p>

<p>Abruptly Bashere appeared in the Hall&rsquo;s tall
doorway. When he nodded, Rand sat up. At last. At bloody last. The
green-and-white tassel swayed as he gestured with the dragon-carved
length of Seanchan spear. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done well, Master Norry.
Your report left nothing out. I will see that the gold you need is
provided. But I must attend to other matters now, if you will
forgive me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man gave no sign of curiosity or hurt at being
cut off so abruptly. He merely stopped in midword, bowed with &ldquo;As
the Lord Dragon commands&rdquo; in that same dry tone, and backed away
three steps before turning. He did not even glance at Bashere in
passing. Nothing real but the ledgers.</p>

<p>Impatiently, Rand nodded to Bashere and set himself
erect and stiff-backed on the throne. The Aiel went silent. It made
them seem twice as ready.</p>

<p>When the Saldaean entered, he did not come alone. Two
men and two women followed close behind, none young, in rich silks
and brocades. They tried to pretend Bashere did not exist, and
almost carried it off, but the watchful Aiel among the columns were
another story. Golden-haired Dyelin missed only a step, but Abelle
and Luan, both graying yet hard-faced, frowned at the <em>
cadin&rsquo;sor</em>-clad figures and instinctively felt for the
swords they did not wear today, while Ellorien, a plump dark-haired
woman who would have been pretty were her face not so determinedly
stony, stopped dead and glared before she came to herself and
caught up to the others with a quick stride. Their first good view
of Rand took them aback as well, all of them. Quick wondering
glances passed between them. Perhaps they had thought he would be
older.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Dragon,&rdquo; Bashere intoned loudly, halting
before the dais, &ldquo;Lord of the Morning, Prince of the Dawn, True
Defender of the Light, before whom the world kneels in awe, I give
to you Lady Dyelin of House Taravin, Lord Abelle of House Pendar,
Lady Ellorien of House Traemane, and Lord Luan of House
Norwelyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The four Andorans looked at Bashere then, with tight
lips and sharp sidelong glances. There had been something in his
tone that made it sound as if he was giving Rand four horses. To
say their spines stiffened would be to say water became wetter, yet
it seemed so as they stared up at Rand. Mostly at Rand. Their eyes
could not help drifting to the Lion Throne shining and glittering
on its pedestal beyond his head.</p>

<p>He wanted to laugh at their outraged faces. Outraged,
but also careful, and perhaps a touch impressed in spite of
themselves. He and Bashere had worked out that list of titles
between them, but the bit about the world kneeling was new,
Bashere&rsquo;s own late addition. Moiraine had given him the
advice, though. He almost thought he heard her silvery voice again.
<em>How people see you first is what they hold hardest in their
minds. It is the way of the world. You can step down from a throne,
and even if you behave like a farmer in a pigsty, some part in each
of them will remember that you did descend from a throne. But if
they see only a young man first, a country man, they will resent
him stepping up to his throne later, whatever his right, whatever
his power</em>. Well, if a title or two could make anything so,
everything would be a deal easier.</p>

<p><em>I was the Lord of the Morning</em>, Lews Therin
mumbled. <em>I am the Prince of the Dawn.</em></p>

<p>Rand kept his face smooth. &ldquo;I will not welcome you&mdash;this is your land, and the palace of your queen&mdash;but I
am pleased you accept my invitation.&rdquo; After five days and with just
a few hours&rsquo; notice, but he did not mention that. Rising, he
laid the Dragon Scepter on the throne, then trotted down from the
dais. With a reserved smile&mdash;<em>Never be hostile unless you
must</em>, Moiraine had said, <em>but above all never be overly
friendly. Never be eager</em>&mdash;he gestured to five
comfortably cushioned chairs with padded backs, set in a circle
among the columns. &ldquo;Join me. We will talk and have some chilled
wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They followed, of course, eyeing the Aiel and him
with equal curiosity and perhaps equal animosity, both poorly
hidden. When they were all seated, <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> came,
silent in their hooded white robes, bringing wine and golden
goblets already damp with condensation. Another stood behind each
chair with a plumed fan, gently stirring the air. Every chair but
Rand&rsquo;s. They noted that, noted the lack of sweat on his face.
But the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> did not perspire either, even in
their robes, and neither did the other Aiel. He watched the
nobles&rsquo; faces over his own winecup.</p>

<p>Andorans were proud of being more straightforward
than many, and they were not slow to boast that the Game of Houses
was far more entwined in other lands than in theirs, yet they still
believed they could play <em>Daes Dae&rsquo;mar</em> when they had
to. After a fashion they could, but the truth was, Cairhienin and
even Tairens considered them simple when it came to the subtle move
and countermove of the Great Game. These four kept their composure
for the most part, but to someone schooled by Moiraine, schooled
harder in Tear and Cairhien, they gave away much with every shift
of eye, every slight change of expression.</p>

<p>First it dawned on them that there was no chair for
Bashere. Quick looks flickered between them, a slight brightening,
especially when they realized Bashere was striding from the throne
room. All four actually let themselves glance after him with the
faintest of satisfied smiles. They must dislike a Saldaean army in
Andor as much as Naean and that lot did. Now their thoughts were
obvious: Perhaps the foreigner&rsquo;s influence was less than they
had feared. Why, Bashere had been treated as no more than a
superior servant.</p>

<p>Dyelin&rsquo;s eyes widened slightly at almost the
same instant as Luan&rsquo;s, and only a moment ahead of the other
two. For a moment they stared at Rand so closely it was plain they
avoided looking at one another. Bashere was an outlander, but also
the Marshal-General of Saldaea, three times a lord, and uncle to
Queen Tenobia. If Rand used him like a servant&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent wine.&rdquo; Staring into his goblet, Luan
hesitated before adding, &ldquo;My Lord Dragon.&rdquo; It might have been
pulled out of him with a rope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the south,&rdquo; Ellorien said after a sip. &ldquo;A
Tunaighan Hills vintage. A wonder you can find ice in Caemlyn this
year. I have heard people already calling this &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;The year without a
winter.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I would waste time and effort finding
ice,&rdquo; Rand said, &ldquo;when so many troubles inflict the world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abelle&rsquo;s angular face paled, and he seemed to
force himself to take another swallow. On the other hand, Luan
emptied his winecup deliberately and thrust it out to be filled by
a <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> whose green eyes flashed a fury at strong
odds with the obstinate mildness of his sun-dark face. Serving
wetlanders was like being a servant, and Aiel despised the very
notion of servants. How that disgust squared with the very concept
of <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> Rand had never been able to determine,
but it was so.</p>

<p>Dyelin held her wine firmly on her knees and ignored
it thereafter. This close, Rand could see touches of gray in her
golden hair; she was still lovely, though in nothing except the
hair did she look at all like Morgase or Elayne. Next in line for
the throne, she must be a cousin at least, and close. Frowning
briefly at him, she seemed on the point of shaking her head, but
instead said, &ldquo;We are concerned with the world&rsquo;s troubles, but
more with those inflicting Andor. Did you bring us here to find a
cure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you know one,&rdquo; Rand replied simply. &ldquo;If not, I
must look elsewhere. Many think they know the right cure. If I
cannot find the one I want, I will have to accept the next best.&rdquo;
That tightened mouths. On the way here, Bashere had taken them
through a courtyard where Arymilla and Lir and the rest of those
had been left cooling their heels. Taking their ease in the Palace,
it would seem. &ldquo;I would think you&rsquo;d want to help put Andor
back together. You&rsquo;ve heard my proclamation?&rdquo; He did not have
to say which one; in this context, there could be only one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A reward offered for news of Elayne,&rdquo; Ellorien said
flatly, her face becoming even stonier, &ldquo;who is to be made queen
now that Morgase is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dyelin nodded. &ldquo;That seemed well, to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to me!&rdquo; Ellorien snapped. &ldquo;Morgase betrayed her
friends and spurned her oldest adherents. Let us see an end to
House Trakand on the Lion Throne.&rdquo; She seemed to have forgotten
Rand. They all did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dyelin,&rdquo; Luari said curtly. She shook her head as if
she had heard this before, but he went on. &ldquo;She has the best claim.
I speak for Dyelin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elayne is the Daughter-Heir,&rdquo; the golden-haired
woman told them levelly. &ldquo;<em>I</em> speak for Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does it matter who any of us speak for?&rdquo; Abelle
demanded. &ldquo;If he killed Morgase, he will&mdash;&rdquo; Abelle cut off
abruptly with a grimace, then looked at Rand, not exactly in
defiance, but definitely daring him to do his worst. And expecting
him to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really believe that?&rdquo; Rand glanced sadly at
the Lion Throne on its pedestal. &ldquo;Why under the Light would I kill
Morgase only to hand that to Elayne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Few know what to believe,&rdquo; Ellorien said stiffly.
Spots of color still stained her cheeks. &ldquo;People say many things,
most foolish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such as?&rdquo; He directed the question to her, but it
was Dyelin who answered, looking him straight in the eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you will fight the Last Battle and kill the
Dark One. That you are a false Dragon, or an Aes Sedai puppet, or
both. That you&rsquo;re Morgase&rsquo;s illegitimate son, or a Tairen
High Lord, or an Aielman.&rdquo; She frowned again for a moment, but did
not stop. &ldquo;That you are the son of an Aes Sedai by the Dark One.
That you <em>are</em> the Dark One, or else the Creator clothed in flesh.
That you will destroy the world, save it, subjugate it, bring a new
Age. As many tales as there are mouths. Most say you killed
Morgase. Many add Elayne. They say your proclamation is a mask to
hide your crimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand sighed. Some of those sayings were worse than
any he had heard. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t ask which you believe.&rdquo; Why did she
keep frowning at him? She was not the only one. Luan did too, and
Abelle and Ellorien darted the sort of glances at him that he had
come to expect from Arymilla&rsquo;s bunch when they thought he was
not looking. <em>Watching. Watching</em>. That was Lews Therin, a
hoarse giggling whisper. <em>I see you. Who sees me?</em> &ldquo;Instead,
will you help me make Andor whole again? I don&rsquo;t want Andor to
become another Cairhien, or worse, a Tarabon or Arad Doman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know something of the <em>Karaethon Cycle</em>,&rdquo;
Abelle said. &ldquo;I believe you are the Dragon Reborn, but nothing
there speaks of you ruling, only fighting the Dark One at Tarmon
Gai&rsquo;don.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s hand tightened on his goblet so hard the
dark surface of the wine trembled. How much easier if these four
were like most of the Tairen High Lords, or the Cairhienin, but not
one of them wanted a shaving more power for themselves than they
already had. However the wine had been chilled, he doubted the One
Power would intimidate this lot. <em>In all likelihood, they&rsquo;d
tell me to kill them and be burned for it!</em></p>

<p><em>Burn for it</em>, Lews Therin echoed
morosely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many times must I say I don&rsquo;t want to rule
Andor? When Elayne sits on the Lion Throne, I will leave Andor. And
never return, if I have my way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the throne belongs to anyone,&rdquo; Ellorien said
tightly, &ldquo;it belongs to Dyelin. If you mean what you say, see her
crowned, and go. Then Andor will be whole, and I don&rsquo;t doubt
Andoran soldiers will follow you to the Last Battle, if that&rsquo;s
what is called for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I refuse still,&rdquo; Dyelin answered in a strong voice,
then turned to Rand. &ldquo;I will wait and consider, my Lord Dragon.
When I see Elayne alive and crowned, and you leave Andor, I will
send my retainers to follow you whether anyone else in Andor does
the same. But if time passes and you still reign here, or if your
Aiel savages do here what I&rsquo;ve heard they did in Cairhien and
Tear&rdquo;&mdash;she scowled at the Maidens and Red Shields, and the
<em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> too, as if she saw them looting and burning&mdash;&ldquo;or you loose here those&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;men you gather with your
amnesty, then I will come against you, whether anyone else in Andor
does the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I will ride beside you,&rdquo; Luan said firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; Ellorien said, echoed by Abelle.</p>

<p>Rand threw back his head and laughed in spite of
himself, half mirth, half frustration. <em>Light! And I thought
honest opposition would be better than sneaking behind my back or
licking my boots!</em></p>

<p>They eyed him uneasily, doubtless thinking it was
madness at work. Maybe it was. He was not sure himself anymore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consider what you must,&rdquo; he told them, standing to
end the audience. &ldquo;I mean what I said. But consider this as well.
Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don is coming closer. I don&rsquo;t know how long we
have for you to spend considering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They made their goodbyes&mdash;a careful bow of the
head, as between equals, and at that more than when they arrived&mdash;but as they turned to go, Rand caught Dyelin&rsquo;s sleeve.
 &ldquo;I have a question for you.&rdquo; The others paused, half turning back.
 &ldquo;A private question.&rdquo; After a moment she nodded, and her companions
moved a little way down the throne room. They watched closely, but
they were not near enough to hear. &ldquo;You looked at me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;strangely,&rdquo; he said. <em>You and every other noble I&rsquo;ve met in
Caemlyn</em>. Every Andoran noble, at least. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dyelin peered up at him, then finally nodded slightly
to herself. &ldquo;What is your mother&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand blinked. &ldquo;My mother?&rdquo; Kari al&rsquo;Thor was his
mother. That was how he thought of her; she had raised him from
infancy, until she died. But he decided to give her the cold truth
he had learned in the Waste. &ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s name was Shaiel. She
was a Maiden of the Spear. My father was Janduin, clan chief of the
Taardad Aiel.&rdquo; Her eyebrows rose doubtfully. &ldquo;I will swear it on
any oath you choose. What does that have to do with what I want to
know? They&rsquo;re both long dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Relief crept across her face. &ldquo;A chance resemblance,
it seems; no more. I do not mean to say you don&rsquo;t know your
parents, but you have the west of Andor on your tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A resemblance? I grew up in the Two Rivers, but my
parents were as I said. Who do I look like to make you stare at
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hesitated, then sighed. &ldquo;I do not suppose it
matters. Someday you must tell me how you had Aiel parents yet were
raised in Andor. Twenty-five years ago, more now, the Daughter-Heir
of Andor vanished in the night. Her name was Tigraine. She left
behind a husband, Taringail, and a son, Galad. I know it is only
chance, yet I see Tigraine in your face. It was a shock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand felt a shock of his own. He felt cold. Fragments
of the tale the Wise Ones had told him spun through his head&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>a golden-haired young wetlander, in silks</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>son
she loved; a husband she did not</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Shaiel was the name
she took. She never gave another</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>You have something
of her in your features</em>. &ldquo;How was it that Tigraine vanished? I
have an interest in the history of Andor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will thank you not to call it history, my Lord
Dragon. I was a girl when it happened, but more than a child, and
here in the Palace often. One morning, Tigraine simply was not in
the Palace, and she was never seen again. Some claimed to see
Taringail&rsquo;s hand in it, but he was half-mad with grief.
Taringail Damodred wanted more than anything else in the world to
see his daughter Queen of Andor and his son King of Cairhien. He
was Cairhienin, Taringail. That marriage was meant to stop the wars
with Cairhien, and it did, yet Tigraine vanishing made them think
Andor wanted to break the treaty, which led them to scheme the way
Cairhienin do, which led to Laman&rsquo;s Pride. And you of course
know where that led,&rdquo; she added dryly. &ldquo;My father said Gitara Sedai
was really at fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gitara?&rdquo; A wonder he did not sound strangled. He had
heard that name more than once. It had been an Aes Sedai named
Gitara Moroso, a woman with the Foretelling, who announced that the
Dragon had been Reborn on the slopes of Dragonmount, and so set
Moiraine and Siuan on their long search. It had been Gitara Moroso
who years before that told &ldquo;Shaiel&rdquo; that unless she fled to the
Waste, telling no one, and became a Maiden of the Spear, disaster
would fall on Andor and the world.</p>

<p>Dyelin nodded, a touch impatiently. &ldquo;Gitara was
counselor to Queen Mordrellen,&rdquo; she said briskly, &ldquo;but she spent
more time with Tigraine and Luc, Tigraine&rsquo;s brother, than with
the Queen. After Luc rode north, never to return, whispers said
Gitara had convinced him that his fame lay in the Blight, or his
fate. Others said it was that he would find the Dragon Reborn
there, or that the Last Battle depended on him going. That was
about a year before Tigraine disappeared. Myself, I doubt Gitara
had anything to do with it, or with Luc. She stayed the
Queen&rsquo;s counselor until Mordrellen died. From heartbreak over
Tigraine on top of Luc, so it was said. Which began the Succession,
of course.&rdquo; She glanced toward the others, who were shifting their
feet and frowning with suspicion and impatience, but she could not
resist adding one more thing. &ldquo;You would have found a different
Andor, without that. Tigraine queen, Morgase only High Seat of
House Trakand, Elayne not born at all. Morgase married Taringail
once she had the throne, you see. Who can say what else would be
changed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Watching her join the others and go, he thought of
one thing that would have changed. He would not be in Andor, for he
would not have been born. Everything folded back into itself, in
endless circles. Tigraine went to the Waste in secret, which made
Laman Damodred cut down <em>Avendoraldera</em>, a gift of the Aiel,
to make a throne, an act which brought the Aiel across the Spine of
the World to kill him&mdash;that had been their only goal, though
the nations called it the Aiel War&mdash;and with the Aiel came a
Maiden named Shaiel, who died giving birth. So many lives changed,
lives ended, so she could give birth to him at the proper time and
place and die doing it. Kari al&rsquo;Thor was the mother he
remembered, if dimly, yet he wished he could have known Tigraine or
Shaiel or whatever she wanted to call herself, even if only for a
little while. Just to have seen her.</p>

<p>Useless dreaming. She was long dead. It was over and
done. So why did it still nag at him?</p>

<p><em>The Wheel of Time and the wheel of a man&rsquo;s
life turn alike without pity or mercy</em>, Lews Therin
murmured.</p>

<p><em>Are you really there?</em> Rand thought. <em>If
there&rsquo;s more than a voice and a few old memories, answer me!
Are you there?</em> Silence. He could use Moiraine&rsquo;s advice
now, or somebody&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Abruptly he realized he was staring at the white
marble wall of the Grand Hall, staring just north of west. Toward
Alanna. She was away from Culain&rsquo;s Hound. <em>No! Burn
her!</em> He would not replace Moiraine with a woman who would
ambush him that way. He could not trust any woman touched by the
Tower. Except three. Elayne, Nynaeve and Egwene. He hoped he could
trust them. If only just a little.</p>

<p>For some reason he looked up at the great vaulted
ceiling, with its colored windows depicting battles and queens,
alternating with the White Lion. Those more than life-size women
seemed to stare at him, in disapproval, wondering what he was doing
there. Imagination, of course, but why? Because he had learned
about Tigraine? Imagination, or madness?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Someone has come I think you should see,&rdquo; Bashere
said at his elbow, and Rand jerked away from the women overhead.
Had he really been glaring back at them? Bashere had one of his
horsemen with him, a taller fellow&mdash;not hard to be, beside
Bashere&mdash;with a dark beard and mustaches, his tilted eyes
green.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not unless it&rsquo;s Elayne,&rdquo; Rand said, more
harshly than he meant, &ldquo;or somebody with proof the Dark One is
dead. I am going to Cairhien this morning.&rdquo; He had had no such
intention until the words left his mouth. Egwene was there. And the
queens overhead were not. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been weeks since I was there
last. If I don&rsquo;t keep an eye on them, some lord or lady will
claim the Sun Throne behind my back.&rdquo; Bashere looked at him
strangely. He was explaining too much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, but you will want to see this man first.
He says he comes from Lord Brend, and I think he speaks truth.&rdquo; The
Aiel were on their feet in the instant; they knew who used that
name.</p>

<p>For Rand&rsquo;s part, he stared at Bashere in
surprise. The last thing he expected was an emissary from Sammael.
 &ldquo;Bring him in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hamad,&rdquo; Bashere said with a jerk of his head, and
the younger Saldaean trotted away.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Hamad returned with a knot of
Saldaeans warily guarding a fellow in their midst. At first glance
nothing about the man accounted for their caution. With no weapon
visible, he wore a long gray coat with a raised collar, and a curly
beard but no mustache, both in the Illianer fashion. He had a stub
of a nose and a wide, grinning mouth. As he came closer, though,
Rand realized that grin never altered by a hair. The man&rsquo;s
whole face seemed frozen in that one mirthful expression. By
contrast, his dark eyes stared out of that mask, swimming with
fear.</p>

<p>At ten paces, Bashere raised his hand, and the guard
halted. The Illianer, staring at Rand, did not seem to notice until
Hamad presented a sword point to his chest, making him stop or be
run through. He only glanced at the slightly serpentine blade, then
returned to staring at Rand with those terrified eyes in that
grinning face. His hands hung at his sides, twitching as much as
his face was still.</p>

<p>Rand started to close the distance, but abruptly
Sulin and Urien were there, not exactly blocking his way, yet
positioned so that he would have to push between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what has been done to him?&rdquo; Sulin said,
studying the fellow. A number of Maidens and Red Shields had come
out from the columns, some even veiled. &ldquo;If he is not Shadowspawn,
he is touched by the Shadow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One like that might do things we cannot know,&rdquo; Urien
said. He was one of those with a scarlet strip of cloth around his
temples. &ldquo;Kill with a touch, perhaps. A pretty message that would
be to send an enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neither looked at Rand, not directly, but he nodded.
Perhaps they were right. &ldquo;How are you called?&rdquo; he asked. Sulin and
Urien moved a step to either side when they saw he would stay where
he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do come from&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;from Sammael,&rdquo; the man said
woodenly through that grin. &ldquo;I do bring a message for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;for the
Dragon Reborn. For you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, that was direct enough. Was he a Darkfriend, or
just some poor soul Sammael had trapped in one of the nastier
weavings Asmodean had talked about? &ldquo;What message?&rdquo; Rand said.</p>

<p>The Illianer&rsquo;s mouth worked, struggled. What
came out bore no relation to the voice he had used before. It was
deeper, full of confidence, in a different accent. &ldquo;We will stand
on different sides, you and I, come the day of the Great
Lord&rsquo;s Return, but why should we kill each other now and leave
Demandred and Graendal to contest for the world over our bones?&rdquo;
Rand knew that voice, in one of those scraps from Lews Therin that
had settled in his mind. Sammael&rsquo;s voice. Lews Therin snarled
wordlessly. &ldquo;Already you have much to digest,&rdquo; the Illianer went on&mdash;or Sammael did. &ldquo;Why bite off more? And hard chewing, even
if you don&rsquo;t find Semirhage or Asmodean taking you from behind
while you are busy with it. I propose a truce between us, a truce
until the Day of Return. If you do not move against me, I will not
against you. I will pledge not to move east beyond the Plains of
Maredo, nor further north than Lugard in the east or Jehannah in
the west. You see, I leave the greater share by far to you. I do
not claim to speak for the rest of the Chosen, but at least you
know you have nothing to fear from me, or out of the lands I hold.
I will pledge not to aid them in anything they do against you, nor
to help them defend against you. You have done well so far in
removing the Chosen from the field. I have no doubt you will
continue to do well, better than before, knowing your southern
flank is safe and the others fight without my aid. I suspect that
on the Day of Return, there will be only you and I, as it should
be. As it was meant to be.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s teeth clicked
shut, hidden behind that frozen grin. His eyes looked near
madness.</p>

<p>Rand stared. A truce with Sammael? Even if he could
have trusted the man to keep it, even if it meant one danger set
aside until all the others were dealt with, it also meant leaving
countless thousands to Sammael&rsquo;s mercy, a quality the man had
never had. He felt rage sliding across the surface of the Void, and
realized he had seized <em>saidin</em>. That torrent of searing
sweetness and freezing filth seemed to echo his anger. Lews Therin.
Well enough that he should be mad in this madness. The echo
resonated with his own fury till he could not tell one from the
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take this message back to Sammael,&rdquo; he said coldly.
 &ldquo;Every death he has caused since waking, I lay at his feet and call
due. Every murder he has ever done or caused, I lay at his feet and
call due. He escaped justice in the Rorn M&rsquo;doi, and at Nol
Caimaine, and Sohadra&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; More of Lews Therin&rsquo;s memories,
but the pain of what had been done there, the agony of what Lews
Therin&rsquo;s eyes had seen, burned across the Void as if
Rand&rsquo;s. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but I will see justice done now. Tell him, no
truce with the Forsaken. No truce with the Shadow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The messenger lifted a spasming hand to wipe sweat
from his face. No, not sweat. His hand came away red. Crimson
droplets oozed from his pores, and he trembled head to foot. Hamad
gasped and stepped back, and he was not the only one. Bashere
knuckled his mustaches with a grimace, and even the Aiel stared.
Painted red, the Illianer collapsed in a convulsing heap, blood
spreading around him in a dark, glistening pool smeared by his
thrashing.</p>

<p>Rand watched him die, buried deep in the Void,
feeling nothing. The Void walled off emotion, and there was nothing
he could have done in any case. Had he known Healing, he did not
think it would have stopped that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Bashere said slowly, &ldquo;maybe Sammael will
have his answer when this fellow does not return. I have heard of
killing a messenger who brought bad news, but never killing him to
tell you the news was bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded. The death changed nothing; it changed no
more than learning of Tigraine had. &ldquo;Have someone see to his
burial. A prayer will not hurt, even if it doesn&rsquo;t help
either.&rdquo; Why did those queens in their colored windows still seem
accusing? Surely they had seen as bad in their lifetimes, maybe
even in this chamber. He could still point to Alanna, feel her; the
Void was no shield. Could he trust Egwene? She kept secrets. &ldquo;I may
spend the night in Cairhien.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A strange end to a strange man,&rdquo; Aviendha said,
stepping around the dais. Small doors behind it led to robing
rooms, and from there to corridors beyond.</p>

<p>Rand started to step between her and what lay on the
red-and-white tiles, then stopped. After one curious glance,
Aviendha ignored the body. When she was a Maiden of the Spear she
had surely seen as many men die as he ever had. By the time she
gave up the spear, she had probably killed as many as he had then
seen die.</p>

<p>It was him she concentrated on, running her eyes over
him to make sure he had taken no hurt. Some of the Maidens smiled
at her, and they opened a path to Rand, pushing Red Shields aside
where necessary, but she stayed where she was, readjusting her
shawl and studying him. It was a good thing that whatever the
Maidens thought, she only stayed near him because the Wise Ones
told her to, to spy on him, because he found himself wanting to put
his arms around her right there. Good that she did not want him. He
had given her the ivory bracelet she wore, roses among thorns,
suiting her nature. It was her only piece of jewelry except for a
silver necklace, the intricate patterns the Kandori called
snowflakes. He did not know who had given her that.</p>

<p><em>Light!</em> he thought disgustedly. Wanting
Aviendha and Elayne, when he knew he could have neither. <em>
You&rsquo;re worse than Mat ever thought of being</em>. Even Mat had
the sense to stay away from a woman if he thought he would harm
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go to Cairhien too,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Rand grimaced. One attraction of a night in Cairhien
was that it would be a night without her in the same room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has nothing to do with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; she began sharply,
then bit her full underlip, blue-green eyes flashing. &ldquo;I must speak
with the Wise Ones, with Amys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;No reason you
shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; There was always the chance he could manage to
leave her behind there.</p>

<p>Bashere touched his arm. &ldquo;You were going to watch my
horsemen go through their paces again this afternoon.&rdquo; The tone was
casual, yet his tilted eyes gave the words heavy weight.</p>

<p>It <em>was</em> important, but Rand felt a need to be
out of Caemlyn, out of Andor. &ldquo;Tomorrow. Or the day after.&rdquo; He had
to be away from the eyes of those queens, wondering whether one of
their blood&mdash;Light, he was!&mdash;would tear their
land apart as he had so many others. Away from Alanna. If only for
a night, he had to be away.</p>
