<h4><em>The Wheel of a Life</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">G</span>athering
his sword belt from beside the throne with
a flow of Air, and the scepter too, Rand opened the gateway right
there before the dais, a slash of light that rotated, widening to
give a view of an empty dark-paneled chamber more than six hundred
miles from Caemlyn, in the Sun Palace, the Royal Palace of
Cairhien. Set aside for his use this way, the room held no
furnishings, but dark blue floor tiles and wood-paneled walls
glistened from polishing. Windowless, the room was bright anyway;
eight gilded stand-lamps burned day and night, mirrors magnifying
the oil-fed flames. He paused to buckle on his sword while Sulin
and Urien opened the door to the corridor and led veiled Maidens
and Red Shields through before him.</p>

<p>In this case he thought their caution ridiculous. The
broad corridor outside, the only way to reach the room, was already
crowded with thirty or so <em>Far Aldazar Din</em>, Brothers of the
Eagle, and nearly two dozen of Berelain&rsquo;s Mayeners in
red-painted breastplates and rimmed pot-like helmets that came down
to the nape of the neck in back. If there was one place anywhere
that Rand knew he needed no Maidens, it was Cairhien, more so even
than Tear.</p>

<p>A Brother of the Eagle was already loping down the
hallway by the time Rand appeared, and a Mayener awkwardly
clutching spear and shortsword as he followed the taller Aielman.
In fact, a small army trailed after the <em>Far Aldazar Din</em>,
servants in various liveries, a Tairen Defender of the Stone in
burnished breastplate and black-and-gold coat, a Cairhienin soldier
with the front of his head shaved, his breastplate much more
battered than the Tairen&rsquo;s, two young Aiel women in dark heavy
skirts and loose white blouses whom Rand thought he recognized as
apprentices to Wise Ones. News of his arrival would spread quickly.
It always did.</p>

<p>At least Alanna was far away. Verin, too, but most of
all Alanna. He still felt her, even at this distance, just a vague
impression that she was somewhere to the west. Like the feel of a
hand just a hair from touching the back of his neck. Was there any
way to get free of her? He seized <em>saidin</em> again for a
moment, but that still made no difference.</p>

<p><em>You never escape the traps you spin
yourself</em>. Lews Therin&rsquo;s murmur sounded confused. <em>Only
a greater power can break a power, and then you&rsquo;re trapped
again. Trapped forever so you cannot die</em>.</p>

<p>Rand shivered. Sometimes it really did seem that
voice was speaking to him. If only it would make sense once in a
while, having it in his head would be easier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you, <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>,&rdquo; one of the
Brothers of the Eagle said. His gray eyes were on a level with
Rand&rsquo;s, the scar slashing across his nose stark white against
his sun-dark face. &ldquo;I am Corman of the Mosaada Goshien. May you
find shade this day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand had no chance to answer properly before the
pink-cheeked Mayener officer was shouldering in. Well, not exactly
shouldering&mdash;he was too slender to shoulder aside a man a
head taller and half again as wide, especially an Aiel, though
maybe young enough to think he could&mdash;yet he did squeeze
himself in front of Rand next to Corman, tucking under his arm a
crimson helmet with a single slender red plume. &ldquo;My Lord Dragon, I
am Havien Nurelle, Lord Lieutenant in the Winged Guards&rdquo;&mdash;there were wings worked on the sides of his helmet&mdash;&ldquo;in
service to Berelain sur Paendrag Paeron, First of Mayene, and at
your service also.&rdquo; Corman gave him an amused sideways look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you, Havien Nurelle,&rdquo; Rand said gravely, and
the boy blinked. Boy? Come to think on it, he might be no younger
than Rand. That was a shock! &ldquo;If you and Corman will show me&mdash;&rdquo; Suddenly he realized Aviendha was gone. He nearly broke his back
trying to avoid the woman, and the first time in weeks he agreed to
let her near him, she slipped away as soon as his head turned!
 &ldquo;Take me to Berelain and Rhuarc,&rdquo; he ordered gruffly. &ldquo;If
they&rsquo;re not together, take me to whoever is closer, and find
the other.&rdquo; Running to the Wise Ones, no doubt, to report on what
he had been up to. He <em>would</em> leave the woman behind
here.</p>

<p><em>What you want is what you cannot have. What you
cannot have is what you want</em>. Lews Therin laughed maniacally.
It did not bother Rand as much as it once had. Not quite as much,
What had to be endured, could be.</p>

<p>Discussing who was nearest, Corman and Havien left
their men behind, but they still made quite a procession, with all
the Maidens and Red Shields following close, crowding the
square-vaulted hallway. The corridor had a dark, heavy feel despite
lighted stand-lamps. There was very little color anywhere, except
in occasional tapestries, and the Cairhienin tried to make up for
it by having everything rigidly arranged, whether embroidered
flowers or birds, deer or leopards in a hunt, or nobles in battle.
For the Cairhienin servants who scurried out of the way, livery
usually meant colored stripes on the cuffs and a house badge
embroidered on the breast; sometimes a collar or sleeves in House
colors, very seldom an entire coat or dress. Only upper servants
would show more color. Cairhienin liked order, and disliked
flamboyance. An occasional niche held a golden bowl or a Sea Folk
vase, but stark and worked with straight lines, trying to disguise
their curves if they had any. Whenever the hall gave way to a
square-columned colonnade, if there was a garden below, the walks
made a precise grid, every flower bed the same size, shrubs and
small trees rigidly pruned and spaced. Had the drought and heat
allowed any flowers, he was sure they too would have bloomed in
straight lines.</p>

<p>Rand wished Dyelin could see those bowls and vases.
The Shaido had carried away whatever they could lift, all the way
across Cairhien, and burned what they could when they could not
carry it, but such behavior violated <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>.
The Aiel who followed Rand and had saved the city had taken, but by
their rules, when they took a place in battle they were allowed a
fifth of what it held and not a spoon more. Bael had agreed,
reluctantly, to forgo even that in Andor, but Rand thought no one
without a list would believe anything had been taken here at
all.</p>

<p>For all their discussion, Corman and Havien failed to
find either Rhuarc or Berelain before they were found themselves
instead.</p>

<p>The two came to meet Rand alone in one of the
colonnades, without entourage, which only made him feel as though
he was leading a parade himself. Rhuarc in his <em>
cadin&rsquo;sor</em>, gray streaking his dark red hair, towered over
Berelain, a pale, beautiful young woman in a blue and white dress
cut low enough to make Rand clear his throat when she curtsied.
<em>Shoufa</em> looped loosely around his neck, Rhuarc carried no
weapon but a heavy Aiel knife. She wore the Diadem of the First, a
golden hawk in flight, in shining black hair that made waves to
bare shoulders.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was just as well Aviendha had gone;
sometimes she had a violent way toward women she even thought were
putting themselves forward with him.</p>

<p>Suddenly he realized that Lews Therin was humming
tunelessly. Something about it seemed troubling, but what&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?
Humming. Like a man admiring a pretty woman who was not aware of
him.</p>

<p><em>Stop that!</em> Rand shouted inside his head.
<em>Stop looking through my eyes!</em> No telling whether he heard&mdash;was there someone there to hear?&mdash;but the humming
stopped.</p>

<p>Havien went to one knee, but Berelain gestured him to
rise almost absently. &ldquo;I trust all is well with my Lord Dragon, and
with Andor.&rdquo; She had the sort of voice that made a man listen. &ldquo;And
with your friends, Mat Cauthon and Perrin Aybara, as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All is well,&rdquo; he told her. She always asked after
Mat and Perrin, however often he told her one was on his way to
Tear and the other he had not seen since before going to the Waste.
 &ldquo;And with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Berelain glanced at Rhuarc as they fell in on either
side of Rand, proceeding into the next stretch of corridor. &ldquo;As
well as can be expected, my Lord Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well, Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; Rhuarc said. There
was not much expression on his face, but then, there seldom
was.</p>

<p>Rand knew both understood why he had put Berelain in
charge here. Cold reasons. The first ruler to offer him alliance
freely, he could trust her because she needed him, now more than
ever since that alliance, to keep Tear from Mayene&rsquo;s throat.
The High Lords had always tried to treat Mayene like a province.
Besides, a foreigner from a small nation hundreds of leagues south,
she had no reason to favor one faction over another in Cairhien,
she had no hope of seizing power, and she knew the running of a
country. Hard reasons. Given how Aiel felt about Cairhienin and
Cairhienin about Aiel, putting Rhuarc in charge would have led to
bloodshed, and Cairhien had had enough of that.</p>

<p>The arrangement seemed to be working out well. As
with Semaradrid and Weiramon in Tear, the Cairhienin accepted a
Mayener as governor as much because she was not Aiel as because
Rand appointed her. Berelain did know what she was doing, and she
at least listened to advice offered by Rhuarc, speaking for the
clan chiefs remaining in Cairhien. No doubt she had to deal with
the Wise Ones as well&mdash;they would give up meddling, which
they did not see as such, a day after Aes Sedai did&mdash;but she
had not mentioned them so far.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Egwene?&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Is she any better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Berelain&rsquo;s lips compressed slightly. She did not
like Egwene. But then, Egwene did not like her. No reason for it,
that he knew, but there it was.</p>

<p>Rhuarc spread his hands. &ldquo;So far as Amys tells me.&rdquo;
As well as being a Wise One, Amys was his wife. One of his wives;
he had two, one of the odder Aiel customs among many Rand found
odd. &ldquo;She says Egwene yet needs rest, light exercise, plenty of
food and fresh air. I think she takes walks in the cool of the
day.&rdquo; Berelain gave him a wry look; the faint sheen of perspiration
on her face did not detract from her beauty, but of course Rhuarc
was not sweating at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to see her. If the Wise Ones permit,&rdquo;
Rand added. The Wise Ones were as jealous of their prerogatives as
any Aes Sedai he had ever met, making sure of them with sept
chiefs, clan chiefs and perhaps most of all with the <em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>. &ldquo;But first we&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A noise had been catching the edge of hearing as they
approached another place where one wall of the corridor was
replaced by balustraded columns. The clatter of practice swords. He
glanced down in passing. At least that was his intention. What he
saw in the stone-paved courtyard below stilled his tongue and
stopped his feet. Under the eye of a stiff-backed Cairhienin in a
plain gray coat, a dozen sweat-drenched women flailed away in
pairs, some wearing riding dresses with divided skirts, some
men&rsquo;s coats and breeches. Most were awkward in the forms if
vigorous, while others flowed from stance to stance smoothly yet
swung the bundled-lathe blades hesitantly. All wore grim
determination like a cloak, though grimness was likely to break
into rueful laughter when one realized she had made a mistake.</p>

<p>The stiff-backed fellow clapped his hands, and the
panting women leaned on their practice swords, some working arms
clearly unused to this. From beyond Rand&rsquo;s sight servants
darted out, bowing and curtsying right and left as they proffered
trays with pitchers and cups. But if they were servants, their
livery was odd for Cairhien. They wore white. Dresses or coats and
breeches, all pure white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; he asked. Rhuarc made a disgusted
sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of the Cairhienin women are quite impressed
with the Maidens,&rdquo; Berelain said, smiling. &ldquo;They want to be
Maidens. Only of the sword, I suppose, not the spear.&rdquo; Sulin
stiffened indignantly, and handtalk flashed among the Maidens; the
gestures seemed outraged. &ldquo;These are daughters of noble Houses,&rdquo;
Berelain went on. &ldquo;I let them stay here because their parents would
not allow this. There are nearly a dozen schools in the city now
that will teach the sword to women, but many need to sneak away to
attend. It is not only women, of course. The younger Cairhienin in
general seem very impressed with the Aiel They are adopting <em>
ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are mangling it,&rdquo; Rhuarc growled. &ldquo;Many ask
about our ways, and who would not teach one who would learn what is
proper? Even a treekiller.&rdquo; He looked ready to spit. &ldquo;But they take
what they are told and change it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not change, really,&rdquo; Berelain protested. &ldquo;Only
adapt, I think.&rdquo; Rhuarc&rsquo;s eyebrows rose a fraction, and she
sighed. Havien&rsquo;s face was a picture of affront, seeing his
ruler challenged. Neither Rhuarc nor Berelain noticed, they were
intent on Rand. He had the feeling this was an argument the pair
had had often.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They change it,&rdquo; Rhuarc repeated deliberately.
 &ldquo;Those fools down there in white claim to be <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em>. <em>Gai&rsquo;shain!</em>&rdquo; The other Aielmen
muttered; handtalk flickered among the Maidens again. Havien began
to look a trifle uneasy. &ldquo;What battle or raid were they taken in?
What <em>toh</em> have they incurred? You confirmed my ban on
fighting in the city, Berelain Paeron, yet they fight duels
wherever they think they&rsquo;ll not be found, and the loser puts
on white. If one strikes another while both are armed, the one
struck pleads for a duel, and if it is refused, puts on white. What
has that to do with honor or obligation? They change everything,
and do things to make a Sharaman blush. It should be stopped, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Berelain&rsquo;s jaw firmed stubbornly, her hands
tightening to fists on her skirts. &ldquo;Young men always fight.&rdquo; Her
tone was condescending enough that you might almost have forgotten
she was young herself. &ldquo;But since they began this, not one has died
in a duel. Not one. That alone is worth letting them go on. Besides
which, I have faced down fathers and mothers, some powerful, who
wanted their daughters sent home. I will not deny those young women
what I promised them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep them if you wish,&rdquo; Rhuarc said. &ldquo;Let them learn
the sword, if they wish. But let them stop claiming to follow <em>
ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>. Let there be an end to them putting on
white and claiming to be <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>. What they do
offends.&rdquo; His chill blue eyes were fixed on Berelain, but her large
dark eyes remained steady on Rand.</p>

<p>He hesitated only a moment. He thought he understood
what drove the younger Cairhienin to <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>.
Twice conquered by Aiel in twenty-odd years, they had to wonder
whether the secret lay there. Or maybe they thought their defeats
just showed that the Aiel way was better. Clearly the Aiel were
upset by what they saw as a mockery of their beliefs, but in truth,
some of the ways Aiel became <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> seemed no less
peculiar. For instance, speaking to a man of his father-in-law or
to a woman of her mother-in-law&mdash;second-father and
second-mother, in the Aiel way&mdash;was considered hostile enough
to justify drawing weapons unless they had mentioned them first. If
the offended party instead touched you after you spoke, under <em>
ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em> it was the same as touching an armed enemy
without harming him. That gained much <em>ji</em> and incurred much <em>
toh</em>, but the one touched could demand to be made <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em> to lessen the other&rsquo;s honor and their own
obligation. By <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>, a proper demand to be
made <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> had to be honored, so a man or woman
could end up <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> for mentioning somebody&rsquo;s
mother-in-law. Hardly less foolish than what these Cairhienin were
doing. Really it came down to one thing, though. He had put
Berelain in charge; he had to support her. It was as simple as
that. &ldquo;Cairhienin offend you by being Cairhienin, Rhuarc. Leave
them be. Who knows, maybe they will eventually learn enough that
you won&rsquo;t have to hate them anymore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhuarc grunted sourly, and Berelain smiled. To
Rand&rsquo;s surprise, for one moment she seemed about to put her
tongue out at the Aielman. Only his imagination, of course. She was
only a few years older than himself, but she had been ruling Mayene
while he was still guarding sheep in the Two Rivers.</p>

<p>Sending Corman and Havien back to their guard, Rand
moved on, with Rhuarc and Berelain to either side and the rest
following close. A parade. All it needed was drums and
trumpets.</p>

<p>The clatter of practice swords started up again
behind him. Another change, however small. Even Moiraine, who had
long studied the Prophecies of the Dragon, had not known whether
his Breaking the World again meant he would bring on a new Age, but
he was certainly bringing changes, one way and another. As many by
accident, it seemed, as on purpose.</p>

<p>When they reached the door of the study Berelain and
Rhuarc shared&mdash;rising suns decorated the long panels of dark
polished wood, indicating some royal use once&mdash;Rand stopped,
turning to Sulin and Urien. If he could not dispense with all these
guards here, there was nowhere he could. &ldquo;I mean to return to
Caemlyn an hour or so after sunrise tomorrow. Until then, visit the
tents, see your friends, and try not to start any blood feuds. If
you insist, two of you can hang about to protect me from mice; I
don&rsquo;t think anything larger will jump out at me here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Urien grinned slightly and nodded, though he did
gesture about head-high to a Cairhienin and murmur, &ldquo;The mice can
be big here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For an instant Rand thought Sulin meant to argue. Her
flat stare lasted only a moment, though, before she nodded. Still
tight-mouthed, however. Doubtless he would hear the argument in
full once there were only Maidens to hear.</p>

<p>A large room, the study presented sharp contrasts
even at his second sight of it. On the high worked-plaster ceiling,
straight lines and sharp angles made elaborately repeating
patterns, and around the walls as well as on a wide fireplace faced
with deep blue marble. A massive table stood in the middle of the
floor, covered with papers and maps, marking a boundary of sorts.
The two tall narrow windows to one side of the fireplace held clay
pots on deep stools, filled with small plants that showed a few
tiny red-and-white blossoms. On that side of the table a long wall
hanging showed ships at sea, and men hauling nets filled with
oilfish, the source of Mayene&rsquo;s wealth; an embroidery hoop,
with needle and red thread dangling from a piece of half-finished
work, sat on a high-backed chair wide enough for Berelain to curl
up in if she wished. There was a single carpet on the floor, in
flowerlike patterns of gold and red and blue, and a small table
beside the chair held a silver wine pitcher and goblets on a silver
tray, as well as a slim book bound in red with a gold-worked piece
of leather marking Berelain&rsquo;s place.</p>

<p>The floor on the other side of the table was layered
in brightly colored rugs, with tasseled cushions of red and blue
and green scattered about. A tabac pouch, a short-stemmed pipe, and
a pair of tongs sat beside a covered brass bowl atop a small
brass-bound chest, while a slightly larger chest, strapped with
iron, held an ivory carving of a gawky animal Rand doubted really
existed. Two dozen books of all sizes, from small enough to fit a
coat pocket to large enough that even Rhuarc must need both hands
to pick them up, made a neat row across the floor along the wall.
Aiel made everything in the Waste that they needed except books;
peddlers had made fortunes among Aiel hauling nothing but
books.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Rand said when the door was closed, leaving
him alone with Rhuarc and Berelain, &ldquo;how are things really?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I said,&rdquo; Berelain replied. &ldquo;As well as can be
expected. There is more talk of Caraline Damodred and Toram Riatin
in the streets, but most people are too tired to want another war
for a time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is said ten thousand Andoran soldiers have
joined them.&rdquo; Rhuarc began thumbing his pipe full. &ldquo;Rumor always
multiplies by ten when not twenty, yet it is troubling if true. The
scouts say their numbers are not large, but left to grow they could
be more than an annoyance. The yellowfly is almost too small to
see, but if you leave its egg in your skin, you will lose an arm or
leg before it hatches&mdash;if it does not kill you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand grunted noncommittally. Darlin&rsquo;s rebellion
in Tear was not the only one he had to face. House Riatin and House
Damodred, the last two to hold the Sun Throne, had been bitter
rivals before Rand appeared, and likely would be again if he
disappeared. Now they had put rivalry aside&mdash;on the surface
at least; what went on below the surface with Cairhienin could be
something else entirely&mdash;and, like Darlin, meant to gather
strength somewhere Toram and Caraline thought safe. In their case,
the foothills of the Spine of the World, as far from the city as
they could be and remain in the country. They had gathered the same
mix as Darlin, nobles mainly of middle rank, displaced country
folk, some outright mercenaries and perhaps a few former brigands.
Niall&rsquo;s hand might be there, as well, as it was with
Darlin.</p>

<p>Those foothills were not nearly so impenetrable as
Haddon Mirk, but Rand held his hand: he had too many enemies in too
many places. If he paused to swat Rhuarc&rsquo;s yellowfly here, he
might find a leopard on his back somewhere else. He had it in mind
to take the leopard first. If only he knew where all the other
leopards were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of the Shaido?&rdquo; he asked, setting the Dragon
Scepter down on a half-unrolled map. It showed the north of
Cairhien, and the mountains called Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger. The
Shaido might not be as big a leopard as Sammael, but they were a
sight bigger than High Lord Darlin or Lady Caraline. Berelain
handed him a goblet of wine, and he thanked her. &ldquo;Have the Wise
Ones said anything at all about Sevanna&rsquo;s intentions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He would have thought at least one or two could
listen and look around just a little when she journeyed up to
Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger. He would wager the Shaido Wise Ones did
when they came below the River Gaelin. He said neither thing, of
course. The Shaido might have abandoned <em>
ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>, but Rhuarc had a traditional Aiel view of
spying. The Wise Ones&rsquo; views were another thing again, though
exactly what could be hard to pin down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say the Shaido are building holds.&rdquo; Rhuarc
paused, using a pair of tongs to hold a hot coal from the
sand-filled brass bowl over his pipe. When he had it puffed alight,
he went on. &ldquo;They do not think the Shaido ever mean to return to
the Threefold Land. Nor do I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand scrubbed his free hand through his hair.
Caraline and Toram festering, and the Shaido settling in this side
of the Dragonwall. A far more dangerous brew than Darlin. And
Alanna&rsquo;s unseen finger seemed on the point of touching him.
 &ldquo;Is there any other good news?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is fighting in Shamara,&rdquo; Rhuarc said around
his pipestem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Rand asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shamara. Or Shara. They give many names for their
land. Co&rsquo;dansin, Tomaka, Kigalij, others. Any could be true, or
none. They lie without thought, those people. Unwind every bolt of
silk you trade for, or find that only the outside is silk. And if
the next time in the tradehold you happen to find the man who
traded with you, he will deny seeing you before, or coming to trade
before. If you press it, the others kill him to appease you, then
say only he could do anything concerning the silk, and try to trade
you water as wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why is fighting in Shara good news?&rdquo; Rand asked
softly. He did not really want to hear the answer. Berelain was
listening with interest; no one except the Aiel and the Sea Folk
knew much more of the closed lands beyond the Waste than that ivory
and silk came from there. That, and the tales in <em>The Travels of
Jain Farstrider</em>, which were probably too fanciful to be true.
Though come to think of it, Rand did remember the lying being
mentioned, and the different names, except the examples Farstrider
had given matched none of Rhuarc&rsquo;s as far as he could
recall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is never fighting in Shara, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.
It is said the Trolloc Wars infested them&rdquo;&mdash;Trollocs had
entered the Aiel Waste too; since then the Trolloc name for the
Aiel Waste was the Dying Ground&mdash;&ldquo;but if there has been one
battle since, no word of it has come to the tradeholds. Not much
word of anything outside the holdwalls does come inside. They say
their land has always been one, not many as here, always at peace.
When you came from Rhuidean as the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>,
word of you spread, and of your title among the wetlanders here.
The Dragon Reborn. Word traveled to the tradeholds along the Great
Rift and the Cliffs of Dawn.&rdquo; Rhuarc&rsquo;s eyes were calm and
steady; this did not trouble him. &ldquo;Now word comes back across the
Threefold Land. There is fighting in Shara, and Sharamen in the
tradeholds ask when the Dragon Reborn will Break the World.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly the wine tasted sour. Another place like
Tarabon and Arad Doman, torn just by hearing of him. How far did
the ripples spread? Were there wars he would never hear of in lands
he would never hear of, because of him?</p>

<p><em>Death rides on my shoulder</em>, Lews Therin
muttered. <em>Death walks in my footsteps. I am death</em>.</p>

<p>Shuddering, Rand set his goblet on the table. How
much did the Prophecies demand in all those tantalizing hints and
grandly roundabout verses? Was he supposed to add Shara, or
whatever it was really called, to Cairhien and the rest? The entire
world? How, when he could not even hold Tear or Cairhien
completely? It would take more than one man&rsquo;s lifetime. Andor.
If he was meant to rip every other land apart, rip the whole world,
he would hold Andor safe for Elayne. Somehow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shara, or whatever it&rsquo;s called, is a long way
from here. One step at a time, and Sammael is the first step.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sammael,&rdquo; Rhuarc agreed. Berelain shivered, and
emptied her goblet.</p>

<p>For a time they talked of the Aiel who were still
moving south. Rand intended the hammer being made in Tear to be
clearly big enough to smash anything Sammael could put in its way.
Rhuarc seemed content; it was Berelain who complained that more
needed to be kept in Cairhien. Until Rhuarc shushed her. She
muttered something about him being too stubborn for his own good,
but she went on to the efforts to resettle farmers on the land. She
thought by next year there would be no need for grain from Tear. If
the drought ever broke. If it did not, Tear would not be supplying
grain to itself, much less anywhere else. The first tendrils of
trade were beginning to reappear. Merchants had begun coming in
from Andor and Tear and Murandy, down from the Borderlands. A Sea
Folk ship had even dropped anchor in the river that very morning,
which she found strange, so far from the sea, but welcome.</p>

<p>Berelain&rsquo;s face took on an intensity, and her
voice a brisk tone, as she moved around the table to take up this
sheaf of papers or that, discussing what Cairhien needed to buy and
what it could afford to buy, what it had to sell now and what it
would have in six months, in a year. Depending on the weather, of
course. She brushed by that as if it was of no matter, though
giving Rand a level look that said he was the Dragon Reborn and if
there was any way to stop the heat, he should find it. Rand had
seen her meltingly seductive, he had seen her frightened, defiant,
wrapped in arrogance, but never like this. She seemed a different
woman altogether. Rhuarc, seated on one of his cushions puffing on
his pipe, appeared amused as he watched her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;this school of yours might do some good,&rdquo; she
said, frowning at a long sheet covered in a precise hand, &ldquo;if they
would stop thinking of new things long enough to make what they
have already thought of.&rdquo; She tapped her lips with a finger,
peering at nothing thoughtfully. &ldquo;You say give them what gold they
ask, but if you would let me hold back unless they actually&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jalani put her plump face in at the door&mdash;Aiel
seemed not to understand knocking&mdash;and said, &ldquo;Mangin is here
to speak with Rhuarc and you, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him I&rsquo;ll be happy to talk with him later&mdash;&rdquo; Rand got that far before Rhuarc broke in quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should speak with him now, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;
The clan chief&rsquo;s face looked grave; Berelain had replaced the
long paper on the table and was studying the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Rand said slowly.</p>

<p>Jalani&rsquo;s head vanished, and Mangin came in.
Taller than Rand, he had been one of those who crossed the
Dragonwall in search of He Who Comes With the Dawn, one of the
handful who took the Stone of Tear. &ldquo;Six days ago I killed a man,&rdquo;
he began without preamble, &ldquo;a treekiller, and I must know if I have
<em>toh</em> to you, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To me?&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;You can defend yourself, Mangin;
Light, you know tha&mdash;&rdquo; For a moment he was silent, meeting gray
eyes that were sober but certainly not afraid. Curious, maybe.
Rhuarc&rsquo;s face told him nothing; Berelain was still not meeting
his gaze. &ldquo;He did attack you, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mangin shook his head slightly. &ldquo;I saw that he
deserved to die, so I killed him.&rdquo; He said it conversationally; he
saw the drains needed cleaning, so he cleaned them. &ldquo;But you have
said we cannot kill the oathbreakers except in battle, or if they
attack us. Do I have <em>toh</em> toward you now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand remembered what he had said&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>him will I
hang</em>. His chest felt tight. &ldquo;Why did he deserve to die?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wore what he had no right to,&rdquo; Mangin
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wore what? What did he wear, Mangin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhuarc answered, touching his left forearm. &ldquo;This.&rdquo;
He meant the Dragon coiled around his arm. Clan chiefs did not
display them often, or even speak of them; almost everything about
the markings were shrouded in mystery, and the chiefs were content
to leave it so. &ldquo;It was a thing of needles and inks, of course.&rdquo; A
tattoo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was pretending to be a clan chief?&rdquo; Rand realized
he was searching for an excuse&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>him will I han</em>g.
Mangin had been one of the first to follow him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mangin said. &ldquo;He was drinking, and showing off
what he should not have had. I see your eyes, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;
He grinned suddenly. &ldquo;It is a puzzle. I was right to kill him, but
now I have <em>toh</em> to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were wrong to kill him. You know the penalty for
murder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A rope around the neck, as these wetlanders use.&rdquo;
Mangin nodded thoughtfully. &ldquo;Tell me where and when; I will be
there. May you find water and shade today, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May you find water and shade, Mangin,&rdquo; Rand told him
sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; Berelain said when the door closed
behind Mangin, &ldquo;that he really will walk to his own hanging of his
own accord. Oh, don&rsquo;t look at me that way, Rhuarc. I
don&rsquo;t mean to impugn him, or Aiel honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Six days,&rdquo; Rand growled, rounding on her. &ldquo;You knew
why he was here, both of you. Six days ago, and you left it to me.
Murder is murder, Berelain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She drew herself up regally, but she sounded
defensive. &ldquo;I am not used to men coming to me and saying they have
just committed murder. Bloody <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>. Bloody
Aielmen and their bloody honor.&rdquo; The curses sounded odd coming from
her mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have no cause to be angry with her, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; Rhuarc put in. &ldquo;Mangin&rsquo;s <em>toh</em> is to
you, not to her. Or to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His <em>toh</em> was to the man he murdered,&rdquo; Rand
said coldly. Rhuarc looked shocked. &ldquo;The next time somebody commits
murder, don&rsquo;t wait for me. You follow the law!&rdquo; That way,
perhaps he would not have to pass sentence again on a man he knew
and liked. He would if he had to. He knew that, and it saddened
him. What had he become?</p>

<p><em>The wheel of a man&rsquo;s life</em>. Lews Therin
murmured. <em>No mercy. No pity</em>.</p>
