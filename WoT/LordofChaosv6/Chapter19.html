<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">R</span>and
thought that he would sleep well that night. He
was nearly tired enough to forget Alanna&rsquo;s touch, and more
important, Aviendha was out in the tents with the Wise Ones, not
undressing for bed with no regard for his presence, not disturbing
his rest with the sound of her breathing. Something else made him
toss, though. Dreams. He always warded his dreams, to keep the
Forsaken out&mdash;and the Wise Ones&mdash;but warding could not
keep out what was already inside. Dreams came of huge white things
like giant bird wings without the bird, sailing across the sky; of
great cities of impossibly tall buildings, shining in the sun, with
shapes like beetles and flattened water-drops speeding along the
streets. He had seen all that before, inside the huge <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em> in Rhuidean where he had gained the Dragons
on his arms, and knew them for images of the Age of Legends, but
this time it was all different. Everything seemed twisted, the
colors&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;wrong, as though something had gone askew in his eyes.
The sho-wings faltered and fell, each carrying hundreds to death.
Buildings shattered like glass, cities burned, the land heaved like
storm-tossed seas. And time after time he faced a beautiful
golden-haired woman, watched love turn to terror on her face. Part
of him knew her. Part of him wanted to save her, from the Dark One,
from any harm, from what he himself was about to do. So many parts
of him, mind splintered in glittering shards, all screaming.</p>

<p>He woke in darkness, sweating, shaking. Lews
Therin&rsquo;s dreams. That had never happened before, not dreaming
the man&rsquo;s dreams. He lay there the hours remaining until
sunrise, staring at nothing, afraid to close his eyes. He held on
to <em>saidin</em> as if he could use it to fight the dead man, but
Lews Therin remained silent.</p>

<p>When pale light finally appeared at the windows, a
<em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> slipped silently into the room with a
cloth-covered silver tray. Seeing Rand awake, he did not speak,
only bowed and left just as quietly. With the Power in him, Rand
smelled cool sweetberry tea and warm bread, butter and honey, the
hot porridge Aiel ate mornings, all as if his nose were in the
tray. Releasing the Source, he dressed and buckled on his sword. He
did not touch the cloth covering the food; he did not much feel
like eating. Holding the Dragon Scepter in the crook of his elbow,
he left his apartments.</p>

<p>The Maidens were back in the wide corridor with
Sulin, and Urien and his Red Shields, but not alone. People crowded
the hallway shoulder to shoulder beyond the guards. And some inside
the ring. Aviendha stood among a delegation of Wise Ones, Amys and
Bair and Melaine, Sorilea of course, Chaelin, a Smoke Water Miagoma
with touches of gray in her dark red hair, and Edarra, a Neder
Shiande who looked not much older than himself, though she already
had an apparently unshakable calm in her blue eyes and a
straight-backed presence to match the others. Berelain was with
them, too, but not Rhuarc or any of the other clan chiefs. What he
had had to say to them had been said, and Aiel did not draw things
out. But then, why were the Wise Ones there? Or Berelain? The
green-and-white dress she wore this morning showed a pleasant
expanse of pale bosom.</p>

<p>Then there were the Cairhienin, outside the ring of
Aiel. Colavaere, strikingly handsome in her middle years, dark hair
an elaborate tower of curls and horizontal slashes coloring her
gown from high gold-embroidered collar to below her knees, more
slashes than anyone else present. Solid, square-faced Dobraine, the
front of his mostly gray hair shaved soldier-fashion and his coat
worn from the straps of a breastplate. Maringil, straight as a
blade, white hair touching his shoulders; he had not shaved his
forehead, and his dark silk coat, striped like Dobraine&rsquo;s
nearly to his knees, was fit for a ball. Two dozen or more
clustered behind, mostly younger men and women, few wearing
horizontal stripes even as low as the waist. &ldquo;Grace favor the Lord
Dragon,&rdquo; they murmured, bowing hand to heart or curtsying, and,
 &ldquo;Grace honors us with the Lord Dragon&rsquo;s presence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Tairens had their contingent as well, High Lords
and Ladies without lesser nobles, in peaked velvet hats and silk
coats with puffy, satin-striped sleeves, in bright gowns with broad
lace ruffs and close-fitting caps of pearls or gems, making their
respects with &ldquo;The Light illumine the Lord Dragon.&rdquo; Meilan stood
foremost, of course, lean and hard and expressionless, with his
gray pointed beard. Close beside him, Fionnda&rsquo;s stern
expression and iron eyes somehow did not diminish her beauty, while
willowy Anaiyella&rsquo;s simpers lessened hers. There were
certainly no smiles of any sort on the faces of Maraconn, a
blue-eyed rarity among Tairens, or bald Gueyam, or Aracome, who
looked twice as slender alongside Gueyam&rsquo;s solid width if just
as steely. They&mdash;and Meilan&mdash;had been thick with Hearne
and Simaan. Rand had not mentioned those two yesterday, or their
treason, but he was sure it was known here, and equally sure his
silence was given meaning according to each man&rsquo;s own mind.
They had grown used to such since coming to Cairhien, and this
morning they watched Rand as if he might suddenly produce orders
for their arrest.</p>

<p>In truth, nearly everyone was watching someone. A
good many eyed the Aiel nervously, often hiding anger with varying
success. Others watched Berelain almost as closely; he was
surprised to see that even the men, even the Tairens, had more
thought than lechery on their faces. Most watched him, of course;
he was who he was, and what he was. Colavaere&rsquo;s cool gaze
shifted between him and Aviendha, where it heated; there was bad
blood there, though Aviendha seemed to have forgotten. Colavaere
would certainly never forget the beating she had received from
Aviendha after being discovered in Rand&rsquo;s rooms, or forgive
the fact that it was common knowledge now. Meilan and Maringil each
made his awareness of the other plain by avoiding the other&rsquo;s
eyes. Both wanted the throne of Cairhien, and both thought the
other his chief rival. Dobraine watched Meilan and Maringil, though
why was anyone&rsquo;s guess. Melaine studied Rand, while Sorilea
studied <em>her</em>, and Aviendha frowned at the floor. One
big-eyed young woman among the Cairhienin wore her hair loose and
cut off at the shoulder instead of piled in ornate curls, and a
sword belted over a dark riding dress with only six slashes of
color. Many of the others did not bother to hide disparaging smiles
when they glanced at her; she hardly seemed to notice, alternating
between staring at the Maidens with stark admiration or at Rand
with stark fear. He remembered her. Selande, one of the stream of
beautiful women Colavaere had thought would tie the Dragon Reborn
to her schemes, until Rand convinced her it would not work. With
Aviendha&rsquo;s unasked help, unfortunately. He hoped Colavaere
feared him enough to forget revenge on Aviendha, but he wished he
could make Selande believe she had nothing to fear. <em>You cannot
please everyone</em>, Moiraine had said. <em>You cannot soothe
everyone</em>. A hard woman.</p>

<p>To cap it all, the Aiel watched everyone except the
Wise Ones, of course. And except Berelain, for some reason. They
always eyed wetlanders suspiciously, yet she might as well have
been another Wise One.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You all honor me.&rdquo; Rand hoped he did not sound too
dry. Back to a parade. He wondered where Egwene was. Probably
lolling in bed. Briefly he considered finding her and making one
last effort to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;no, if she would not tell, he did not know how
to make her. Too bad being <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> did not work when
he most wanted it to. &ldquo;Unfortunately, I will not be able to talk
with you more this morning. I am returning to Caemlyn.&rdquo; Andor was
the problem he had to deal with now. Andor, and Sammael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your orders are to be carried out, my Lord Dragon,&rdquo;
Berelain said. &ldquo;This morning, so you may witness it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My orders?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mangin,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He was told this morning.&rdquo; Most
of the Wise Ones had donned a flat expression, but Bair and Sorilea
both wore open disapproval. Surprisingly, it was directed at
Berelain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to be a witness to every murderer
who&rsquo;s hung,&rdquo; Rand said coldly. In truth, he had forgotten, or
rather shoved it out of his mind. Hanging a man you liked was not
something anyone would want to remember. Rhuarc and the other
chiefs had not even mentioned it when he spoke with them.
Another truth was that he would not make this execution special.
Aiel had to live by the law like anyone else; Cairhienin and
Tairens had to see that, and know that if he would not play
favorites with the Aiel, he certainly would not with them. <em>You
use everything and everybody</em>, he thought, sickened; at least,
he hoped he had thought it. Besides, he did not want to watch any
hanging, much less Mangin&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Meilan certainly looked thoughtful, and sweat was
beading on Aracome&rsquo;s forehead, though that might have been the
heat. Colavaere, face going pale, seemed to be seeing him for the
first time ever. Berelain divided a rueful glance between Bair and
Sorilea, who nodded; could they have told her he would answer as he
had? It did not seem possible. The others&rsquo; reactions varied
from surprise to satisfaction, but he noted Selande in particular.
Wide-eyed, she forgot the Maidens; if she had looked at Rand
fearfully before, now she was terrified. Well, so be it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be leaving for Caemlyn immediately,&rdquo; Rand
told them. A soft sound rippled among the Cairhienin and Tairens,
very much like sighs of relief.</p>

<p>It was no surprise that they all accompanied him as
far as the chamber set aside for his Traveling. Except for
Berelain, the Maidens and Red Shields kept the wetlanders back;
they did not particularly like letting Cairhienin near him, and he
was as glad as they barred the Tairens today. There were plenty of
glares, but no one said anything, not to him. Not even Berelain,
who followed right behind with the Wise Ones and Aviendha, talking
quietly, occasionally laughing softly. That made the hair on his
neck stand, Berelain and Aviendha talking together. And
laughing?</p>

<p>At the square-carved door to the Traveling chamber,
he looked carefully above Berelain&rsquo;s head as she swept him a
deep curtsy. &ldquo;I will tend Cairhien without fear or favor until you
return, my Lord Dragon.&rdquo; Perhaps, despite Mangin, she really had
come this morning just to say that, and be heard by the other
nobles. It brought an indulgent smile from Sorilea for some reason.
He needed to find out what was going on there; he was not going to
have the Wise Ones interfering with Berelain. The rest of the Wise
Ones had drawn Aviendha aside; they seemed to be taking turns
speaking to her, quite firmly though he could not make out words.
 &ldquo;When you see Perrin Aybara next,&rdquo; Berelain added, &ldquo;please give him
my warmest wishes. And Mat Cauthon, also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We await the Lord Dragon&rsquo;s return eagerly,&rdquo;
Colavaere lied, keeping her face carefully neutral.</p>

<p>Meilan glared at her for having managed to speak
first, and made a flowery speech, saying no more really than she
had, which Maringil of course had to top, for floweriness at least.
Fionnda and Anaiyella outdid both, adding enough compliments that
he eyed Aviendha anxiously, but the Wise Ones still had her
occupied. Dobraine contented himself with, &ldquo;Until my Lord
Dragon&rsquo;s return,&rdquo; while Maraconn, Gueyam and Aracome murmured
something indistinct with wary eyes.</p>

<p>It was a relief to duck inside, away from them. The
surprise came when Melaine followed him ahead of Aviendha. He
raised a questioning eyebrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must consult with Bael on business of the Wise
Ones,&rdquo; she told him in a no-nonsense voice, then immediately shot a
sharp look at Aviendha, who had on such an innocent face that Rand
knew she was hiding something. Aviendha looked many things
naturally, but never innocent; never that innocent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you wish,&rdquo; he said. He suspected the Wise Ones
had been waiting a chance to send her to Caemlyn. Who better to
make sure Rand did not influence Bael the wrong way than
Bael&rsquo;s wife? Like Rhuarc, the man had two, which Mat always
said was either a dream or a nightmare and he could not decide
which.</p>

<p>Aviendha watched closely as he opened a gateway back
to Caemlyn, into the Grand Hall. She usually did, though she could
not see his flows. Once she had made a gateway herself, but in a
rare moment of panic, and she had never been able to remember how.
Today for some reason the rotating slash of light apparently
reminded her of what happened that time; red suffused her tan
cheeks, and she suddenly refused to look in his direction. With the
Power filling him, he smelled her, the herbal scent of her soap, a
hint of sweet perfume he could not remember her wearing before. For
once truly eager to be rid of <em>saidin</em>, he was the first one
through into the empty throne room. Alanna seemed to crash home in
his head, her presence as palpable as if she had been right in
front of him. She had been weeping, he thought. Because he had gone
away? Well, let her weep for that. Somehow he had to break free of
her.</p>

<p>His going first did not sit well with the Maidens or
Red Shields, of course. Urien merely grunted and shook his head
disapprovingly. A white-faced Sulin went up on her toes to put
herself nose-to-nose with Rand. &ldquo;The great and powerful <em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> gave his honor to <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>
to carry,&rdquo; she all but hissed in a low whisper. &ldquo;If the mighty <em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> dies in ambush while the Maidens protect
him, <em>Far Dareis Mai</em> has no honor left. If the
all-conquering <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> does not care, perhaps
Enaila is right. Perhaps the omnipotent <em>
Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> is a willful boy who should be held by
the hand lest he run over a cliff because he will not look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s jaw tightened. In private he gritted his
teeth and put up with this&mdash;with less pointed than this,
usually&mdash;for the debt he owed the Maidens, but not even
Enaila or Somara had ever openly berated him in public. Melaine was
already halfway down the hall, skirts gathered up and almost
trotting; apparently she could not wait to reestablish the Wise
Ones&rsquo; influence with Bael. He could not tell whether Urien had
heard, though the man seemed awfully intent on directing his veiled
<em>Aethan Dor</em> as they searched through the columns with the
Maidens, something they had no need of direction to do. Aviendha,
on the other hand, arms folded beneath her breasts, wore such a mix
of frown and approval that he had no doubts about her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yesterday went very well,&rdquo; he told Sulin firmly.
 &ldquo;From now on, I think two guards will be more than sufficient.&rdquo;
Her eyes almost bulged; she could not seem to find breath to speak.
Now that he had taken away, it was time to give back, before she
exploded like an Illuminator&rsquo;s fireworks. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s different
when I go outside the Palace, of course. The guard you have been
giving me will do then, but here, or in the Sun Palace or the Stone
of Tear, two are enough.&rdquo; He turned away while her mouth still
worked silently.</p>

<p>Aviendha fell in beside him as he walked around the
dais holding the thrones to the small doors behind. He had come
here instead of straight to his own rooms in hope that he could
lose her. Even without <em>saidin</em> he could smell her, or maybe
it was the memory. Either way, he wished his head were clogged with
a cold; he liked the smell too much.</p>

<p>Shawl wrapped around her tightly, Aviendha stared
straight ahead of her as if troubled, not noticing when he held the
door into one of the lion-paneled dressing rooms for her, something
that usually aroused at least a little ire, perhaps a tart question
as to which of her arms was broken. When he asked what was the
matter, she gave a start. &ldquo;Nothing. Sulin was right. But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
Suddenly she gave a reluctant grin. &ldquo;Did you see her face? No one
has set her down like that since&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;since never, I think. Not
even Rhuarc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little surprised to find you on my
side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stared at him with those big eyes. He could spend
all day just trying to decide whether they were blue or green. No.
He had no right to think about her eyes. What had happened after
she made that doorway&mdash;to run from him&mdash;made no
difference. He especially had no right to think about that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You trouble me so, Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; she said
without a bit of heat. &ldquo;Light, sometimes I think the Creator made
you just to trouble me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He wanted to tell her it was her own fault&mdash;more than once he had offered to send her back to the Wise Ones,
though it would just mean them putting someone else in her place&mdash;but before he could open his mouth, Jalani and Liah caught
up, followed almost immediately by two Red Shields, one a graying
fellow with three times the scars Liah had on her face. Rand
directed Jalani and the scarred man back to the throne room, which
nearly precipitated an argument. Not from the Red Shield, who
merely glanced at his fellow, shrugged and went, but Jalani drew
herself up.</p>

<p>Rand pointed to the door leading to the Grand Hall.
 &ldquo;The <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> expects <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>
to go where he commands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may be a king to the wetlanders, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor, but not to Aiel.&rdquo; A tough sullenness marred
Jalani&rsquo;s dignity, reminding him how young she was. &ldquo;The
Maidens will never fail you in the dance of spears, but this is not
the dance.&rdquo; Still, she went, after a rapid exchange of handtalk
with Liah.</p>

<p>With Liah and the lean Red Shield, a yellow-haired
man named Cassin who stood a good inch taller than Rand, Rand
strode quickly through the palace to his rooms. And with Aviendha,
of course. If he had thought those bulky skirts might make her
fall behind, he was mistaken. Liah and Cassin remained in the
hallway outside his sitting room, a large chamber with a marble
frieze of lions below the high ceiling and tapestries of hunting
scenes and misty mountains, but Aviendha followed him inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you be with Melaine?&rdquo; he demanded.
 &ldquo;Business of the Wise Ones and all that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said curtly. &ldquo;Melaine would not be pleased
if I interfered right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Light, but <em>he</em> should not be pleased that she
was not going. Tossing the Dragon Scepter atop a table with gilded
vine-carved legs, he undid his sword belt and added that. &ldquo;Did Amys
and the others tell you where Elayne is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a long moment Aviendha stood in the middle of the
blue-tiled floor looking at him, her expression unreadable. &ldquo;They
do not know,&rdquo; she said finally. &ldquo;I asked.&rdquo; He had expected she
would. She had not done it in months, but before coming to Caemlyn
the first time with him, every second word out of her mouth had
been a reminder that he belonged to Elayne. In her view he did, and
what had happened between them beyond that gateway she had made
clearly did not alter the fact, and would not happen again,
something else she had made quite clear. Exactly as he wanted it;
he was worse than a pig to feel regret. Ignoring all the fine
gilded chairs, she settled cross-legged on the floor, arranging her
skirts gracefully. &ldquo;They did speak of you, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why does that not surprise me?&rdquo; he said dryly, and
to his surprise her cheeks reddened. Aviendha was not a woman for
blushes, and this made twice in one day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have shared dreams, some of which concern you.&rdquo;
She sounded slightly strangled until she paused to clear her
throat, then fixed him with a steady, determined gaze. &ldquo;Melaine and
Bair dreamed of you on a boat,&rdquo; she said, the word still awkward
after all these months in the wetlands, &ldquo;with three women whose
faces they could not see, and a scale tilting first one way then
the other. Melaine and Amys dreamed of a man standing by your side
with a dagger to your throat, but you did not see him. Bair and
Amys dreamed of you cutting the wetlands in two with a sword.&rdquo; For
an instant her eyes darted contemptuously to the scabbarded blade
lying atop the Dragon Scepter. Contemptuously, and a bit guiltily.
She had given him that, once the property of King Laman, carefully
wrapped in a blanket so she could not be said to have actually
touched it. &ldquo;They cannot interpret the dreams, but they thought you
should know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first was as opaque to him as to the Wise Ones,
but the second seemed obvious. A man he could not see with a dagger
had to be a Gray Man; their souls given up to the Shadow&mdash;not
merely pledged, but given away&mdash;they could slip past notice
even when you looked right at them, and their only real purpose was
assassination. Why had the Wise Ones not understood something so
plain? As for the last, he feared that was plain as well. He
already was cutting lands apart. Tarabon and Arad Doman were ruins,
the rebellions in Tear and Cairhien could become more than skulking
talk at any time, and Illian would certainly feel the weight of his
sword. And that was aside from the Prophet, and the Dragonsworn
down in Altara and Murandy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any mystery in two of those,
Aviendha.&rdquo; But when he explained, she gave him a doubtful look. Of
course. If Wise One dreamwalkers could not interpret a dream,
certainly no one else could. He grunted sourly and flung himself
into a chair facing her. &ldquo;What else did they dream?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one other I can tell you, though it may not
concern you.&rdquo; Which meant there were some she would not tell, which
made him wonder why the Wise Ones had discussed them with her,
since she was not a dreamwalker. &ldquo;All three had this dream, which
makes it especially significant. Rain,&rdquo; that word still came
clumsily too, &ldquo;coming from a bowl. There are snares and pitfalls
around the bowl. If the right hands pick it up, they will find a
treasure perhaps as great as the bowl. If the wrong hands, the
world is doomed. The key to finding the bowl is to find the one who
is no longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No longer what?&rdquo; This certainly sounded more
important than the rest. &ldquo;Do you mean somebody who&rsquo;s
dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha&rsquo;s dark reddish hair swung below her
shoulders as she shook her head. &ldquo;They know no more than I said.&rdquo;
To his surprise, she rose smoothly with those automatic adjustments
to her clothes that women always made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you&mdash;&rdquo; He coughed deliberately. <em>Do you
have to go?</em> he had been about to say. Light, he wanted her to
go. Every minute around her was torture. But then, every minute
away from her was torture too. Well, he could do what was right and
what was good for him, and best for her. &ldquo;Do you want to go back to
the Wise Ones, Aviendha? To resume your studies? There really
isn&rsquo;t any point to your staying longer. You&rsquo;ve taught me
so much, I might as well have been raised Aiel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her sniff said volumes, but of course she did not
leave it at that. &ldquo;You know less than a boy of six. Why does a man
listen to his second-mother before his own mother, and a woman to
her second-father before her own? When can a woman marry a man
without making a bridal wreath? When must a roofmistress obey a
blacksmith? If you take a silversmith <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, why
must you let her work one day for herself for each she works for
you? Why is the same not true of a weaver?&rdquo; He floundered for
answers short of admitting he did not know, but she suddenly
fiddled with her shawl as if she had forgotten him. &ldquo;Sometimes <em>
ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em> makes for very great jokes. I would laugh
my sides apart if I were not the butt of this one.&rdquo; Her voice
dropped to a whisper. &ldquo;I will meet my <em>toh</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He thought she was talking to herself, but he
answered. Carefully. &ldquo;If you mean about Lanfear, it wasn&rsquo;t me
who saved you. Moiraine did. She died saving all of us.&rdquo;
Laman&rsquo;s sword had rid her of her only other <em>toh</em> to
him, though he had never been able to understand what that was. The
only obligation she knew. He prayed she never learned of the other;
she would see it as one, though he certainly did not.</p>

<p>Aviendha peered at him, head tilted and a slight
smile flickering on her lips. She had regained a self-possession
that would have done Sorilea proud. &ldquo;Thank you, Rand al&rsquo;Thor.
Bair says it is well to be reminded now and then that a man does
not know everything. Be sure to let me know when you mean to go to
sleep. I would not come late and wake you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand sat there staring at the door after she had
gone. A Cairhienin playing the Game of Houses was usually easier to
understand than any woman making no effort to be enigmatic at all.
He suspected that what he felt for Aviendha, whatever that was,
tangled things up worse.</p>

<p><em>What I love, I destroy</em>, Lews Therin laughed.
<em>What I destroy, I love</em>.</p>

<p><em>Shut up!</em> Rand thought furiously, and the
thin-edged laughter vanished. He did not know who he loved, but he
knew who he was going to save. From whatever he could, but from him
most of all.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">In the hallway, Aviendha sagged against the door,
taking deep calming breaths. Meant to be calming, anyway. Her heart
still tried to tear through her rib cage. Being near Rand
al&rsquo;Thor stretched her naked over hot coals, stretched her till
she thought her bones would pop apart. He brought such shame to her
as she had never thought she would know. A great joke, she had told
him, and part of her did want to laugh. She had <em>toh</em>
toward him, but much more toward Elayne. All he had done was save
her life. Lanfear would have killed her without him. Lanfear had
wanted to kill her in particular, as painfully as possible.
Somehow, Lanfear had known. Beside what she had incurred toward
Elayne, her <em>toh</em> toward Rand was a termite mound beside the
Spine of the World.</p>

<p>Cassin&mdash;the cut of his coat told her he was
Goshien as well as <em>Aethan Dor</em>; she did not recognize his
sept&mdash;merely glanced at her from where he squatted with his
spears across his knees; he knew nothing, of course. But Liah
smiled at her, entirely too encouragingly for a woman she did not
know, entirely too knowingly for anyone. Aviendha was shocked to
find herself thinking that Chareen, as Lian&rsquo;s coat marked her,
were often sneaking cats; she had never thought of any Maiden as
anything but <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>. Rand al&rsquo;Thor had
unstrung her brain.</p>

<p>Still, her fingers flashed angrily. <em>Why do you
smile, girl? Have you no better use for your time?</em></p>

<p>Liah&rsquo;s eyebrows raised slightly, and if anything
her smile became amused. Her fingers moved in answer. <em>Who do
you call girl, girl? You are not yet wise, but no longer Maiden. I
think you will put your soul in a wreath to lay at a man&rsquo;s
feet</em>.</p>

<p>Aviendha took a furious step forward&mdash;there
were few insults worse among <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>&mdash;then
stopped. In <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em> she did not think Liah could
match her, but in skirts, she would be defeated. Worse, Liah would
probably refuse to make her <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>; she could,
attacked by a woman who was not a Maiden and not yet a Wise One, or
demand the right to beat Aviendha before any of the Taardad who
could be gathered. A lesser shame than the refusal, but not small.
Worst of all, whether she won or lost, Melaine surely would choose
a method to remind her she had left the spear behind that would
make her wish Liah had drubbed her ten times before all the clans.
In a Wise One&rsquo;s hands, shame was keener than a flaying knife.
Liah never moved a muscle; she knew all that as well as Aviendha
did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you stare at one another,&rdquo; Cassin said idly.
 &ldquo;One day I must learn this handtalk of yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liah glanced at him, her laugh silvery. &ldquo;You will
look pretty in skirts, Red Shield, the day you come to ask to
become a Maiden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aviendha drew a relieved breath when Liah&rsquo;s eyes
left hers; under the circumstances, she could not have looked away
first honorably. Automatically her fingers moved in acknowledgment,
the first handtalk a Maiden learned, since the phrase a new Maiden
used most often. <em>I have</em> toh.</p>

<p>Liah signed back without pause. <em>Very small,
spear-sister</em>.</p>

<p>Aviendha smiled gratefully for the missing hooked
little finger that would have made the term mocking, used to women
who gave up the spear and then tried to behave as if they had
not.</p>

<p>A wetlander servant was running up the hall. Keeping
her face clear of the disgust she felt for someone who spent his
life serving others, Aviendha strode off the other way, so she
would not have to pass the fellow. Killing Rand al&rsquo;Thor would
meet one <em>toh</em>, killing herself the second, but each <em>
toh</em> blocked that solution to the other. Whatever the Wise Ones
said, she had to find some way to meet both.</p>
