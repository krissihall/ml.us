<h4><em>The Answer</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
man only paused long enough to rest his hand on
the door of the sedan chair, and was away as soon as Falion took
the note from his fingers. Her rap had the two bearers moving
almost before the fellow in Tarasin Palace livery stepped back into
the crowd of the square.</p>

<p>There was only one word on the small square of paper.
<em>Gone</em>. She crumpled it in her fist. Somehow they had
slipped out again without her people inside seeing. Months of
futile search had convinced her there was no cache of
<em>angreal</em>, whatever Moghedien believed. She had even
considered putting a Wise Woman or two to the question; one of them
might know its whereabouts, if it existed. And horses might fly.
All that kept her here in this wretched city was the simple fact
that when one of the Chosen gave a command, you obeyed until it was
changed. Anything else was a short road to a painful death. Yet if
Elayne and Nynaeve were here&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;they had ruined everything in
Tanchico. Whether or not they really were full sisters&mdash;impossible as that seemed&mdash;Falion would not take their
presence as coincidence. Maybe there <em>was</em> a cache. For the first
time she was glad that Moghedien had ignored her since giving her
her orders so many months ago in Amadicia. What had felt like
abandonment might yet be a chance for advancement in the
Chosen&rsquo;s eyes. That pair might yet lead her to the cache, and
if not, if there was no cache&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Moghedien had seemed to have
interest in Elayne and Nynaeve themselves. Delivering them would
certainly be better than nonexistent <em>angreal</em>.</p>

<p>Leaning back, she let the sway of the chair soothe
her. She did hate this city&mdash;she had come here as a runaway,
when she was a novice&mdash;but perhaps this visit would end
pleasantly after all.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Sitting in his study, Herid was peering into his pipe
and wondering whether he had the means of lighting it at hand when
the <em>gholam</em> squeezed under the door. Of course, even if Fel
had been paying attention, he would not have believed, and once the
<em>gholam</em> was inside the room, few men would have stood any
chance.</p>

<p>When Idrien came to Fel&rsquo;s study later, she
stared at what was piled none too neatly on the floor beside the
table. It took her a moment to realize what it was, and when she
did, she fainted before she could get a scream out. However many
times she heard of someone torn limb from limb, she had never seen
it before.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The rider turned his horse at the top of the hill for
a last look back at Ebou Dar, gleaming white in the sun. A good
city for looting, and from what he had learned of the local people,
they would resist, so the Blood would allow looting. They would
resist, but he hoped the other eyes were bringing back reports of
disunity such as he had seen. Resistance would not last long, where
a so-called queen ruled a tiny patch of ground, and that combined
the best possibilities. Wheeling his mount, he rode west. Who knew?
Perhaps that fellow&rsquo;s comment had been an omen. Perhaps the
Return would come soon, and the Daughter of the Nine Moons with it.
Surely that would be the greatest omen of victory.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Lying on her back in the night, Moghedien stared at
the roof of the tiny tent she was allowed to herself as one of the
Amyrlin&rsquo;s servants. From time to time her teeth ground, but as
soon as she realized it, she stilled them again, very conscious of
the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> necklace tight around her neck. This Egwene
al&rsquo;Vere was harder than Elayne or Nynaeve had been; she
tolerated less and demanded more. And when she passed the bracelet
to Siuan or Leane, especially Siuan&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Moghedien shivered. That
must be what it would be like if Birgitte could wear the
bracelet.</p>

<p>The tent flap moved aside, admitting just enough
moonlight for her to make out a woman ducking in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Moghedien demanded roughly. When they
sent for her in the night, whoever came always brought a
lantern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call me Aran&rsquo;gar, Moghedien,&rdquo; an amused voice
said, and a small light bloomed inside the tent.</p>

<p>Her own name clove Moghedien&rsquo;s tongue to the
roof of her mouth; that name meant death here. She was struggling
to speak, to say her name was Marigan, when suddenly she became
truly aware of the light. A small glowing white ball, pale, hanging
in the air near her head. With the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em> on her, she
could not do more than think of <em>saidar</em> without permission,
but she could still feel it channeled, see the webs woven. This
time she felt nothing, saw nothing. Just a tiny ball of pure
light.</p>

<p>She stared at the woman who had called herself
Aran&rsquo;gar, recognizing her now. Halima, she thought; secretary
to one of the Sitters, she believed. But a woman certainly, if one
who looked as though she had been designed by a man. A woman. But
that ball of light had to be <em>saidin</em>! &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Her
voice shook slightly, and she was surprised it was so steady.</p>

<p>The woman smiled at her&mdash;a very amused smile&mdash;as she settled beside the pallet. &ldquo;I told you, Moghedien. My
name is Aran&rsquo;gar. You will learn that name in the future, if
you are lucky. Now, listen to me carefully, ask no more questions.
I will tell you what you need to know. In a moment I will remove
your pretty necklace. When I do, you will vanish as quickly and
silently as Logain did. If you do not, you will die here. And that
will be a shame, because you are summoned to Shayol Ghul this very
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moghedien licked her lips. Summoned to Shayol Ghul.
That could mean eternity in the Pit of Doom, or immortality ruling
the world, or anything in between. Little chance it meant being
named Nae&rsquo;blis, not if the Great Lord knew enough of how she
had spent the past months to send someone to free her. Yet it was a
summons she could not refuse. And it meant an end to the
<em>a&rsquo;dam</em> at last. &ldquo;Yes. Remove it. I will go
immediately.&rdquo; There was no point to delaying anyway; she was
stronger than any woman in the camp, but she did not intend to give
a circle of thirteen a chance at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you would see it so,&rdquo; Halima&mdash;or
Aran&rsquo;gar&mdash;chuckled richly. She touched the necklace,
flinching slightly, and Moghedien wondered again about a woman who
apparently channeled <em>saidin</em> and was hurt, however faintly,
by touching what should only hurt a man who could channel. Then the
necklace was off, being slipped hastily into the woman&rsquo;s
pouch. &ldquo;Go, Moghedien. Go, now.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">When Egwene reached the tent and put her head and
lantern in, she found only disturbed blankets. She withdrew
slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; Chesa fussed behind her, &ldquo;you should not be
out in the night air. Night air is bad air. If you wanted Marigan,
I could have fetched her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene looked around. She had felt the necklace come
off, and felt the flash of pain that meant a man who could channel
had brushed the link. Most people were already asleep, but a few
still sat outside their tents around low fires, and some not far.
It might be possible to find out which man had come to
 &ldquo;Marigan&rsquo;s&rdquo; tent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she has run away, Chesa,&rdquo; she said.
Chesa&rsquo;s angry mutterings about women who deserted their
mistresses followed her back to her own tent. It could not have
been Logain, could it? He would not have come back, could not have
known. Could he?</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Demandred knelt in the Pit of Doom, and for once he
did not care that Shaidar Haran watched his trembling with that
eyeless, impassive gaze. &ldquo;Have I not done well, Great Lord?&rdquo; The
Great Lord&rsquo;s laughter filled Demandred&rsquo;s head.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">The unstained tower breaks and bends knee to the forgotten sign.<br>
The seas rage, and stormclouds gather unseen.<br>
Beyond the horizon, hidden fires swell, and serpents nestle in the bosom.<br>
What was exalted is cast down; what was cast down is raised up.<br>
Order burns to clear his path.</p>
