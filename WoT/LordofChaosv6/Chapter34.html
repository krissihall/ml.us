<h4><em>Journey to Salidar</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">E</span>gwene
washed her face. Twice. Then she found her
saddlebags and filled them. Her ivory comb and brush and mirror
went in, and her sewing box&mdash;a small, finely gilded casket
that likely had held some lady&rsquo;s jewels once&mdash;plus a
white cake of rose-perfumed soap and clean stockings and shifts and
handkerchiefs and a host of things, until the leather sides bulged
and she could hardly buckle the flaps down. Several dresses and
cloaks, an Aiel shawl, remained to make a bundle, which she tied
neatly with a cord. That done, she looked around for anything else
she might want to take. It was all hers. Even the tent had been
given to her, but that was certainly too bulky, as were the carpets
and cushions. Her crystal washbasin was beautiful, and far too
heavy. The same for the chests, though several had beautiful work
on the strapping and lovely carving.</p>

<p>Only then, thinking about the chests of all things,
did she realize she was trying to put off the hardest bit of
getting ready. &ldquo;Courage,&rdquo; she said dryly. &ldquo;Heart of an Aiel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It turned out to be quite possible to put on
stockings without sitting down, so long as you did not mind hopping
around. Stout shoes followed, good if she had to walk far, and a
silk shift, white and soft. Then the dark green riding dress, with
its narrow divided skirts. Unfortunately that fit quite snugly over
the hips, enough to remind her, unnecessarily, that she would not
enjoy sitting for a while.</p>

<p>There was no point going outside. Bair and Amys were
probably in their own tents, but she had no intention of risking
the chance one of them might see her do this. It would be like
slapping them. If it worked, that was. If not, she had a very long
ride ahead of her.</p>

<p>Nervously rubbing her fingers over her palms, she
embraced <em>saidar</em>, letting it fill her. And shifted her
feet. <em>Saidar</em> made you more aware of everything, including
your own body, which she would just as soon have missed right then.
Trying something new, something no one had ever tried before that
she knew, should have been done slowly and carefully, but for once
she wanted to be rid of the Source. She channeled briskly, flows of
Spirit, woven just so.</p>

<p>The air shimmered in the middle of the tent along her
weave, cloaking the other side in mistiness. If she was right, she
had just created a place where the interior of her tent was so
similar to its reflection in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> that
there was no difference at all right there. One <em>was</em> the
other. But there was only one way to be sure.</p>

<p>Tossing the saddlebags over her shoulder, she took
the bundle under one arm and stepped through the weave, then let go
of <em>saidar</em>.</p>

<p>She was in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. All it
took to tell her was that the lamps that had been lit were no
longer burning, yet there was a sort of light. Things moved
slightly between one glance and the next, the washbasin, a chest.
She was in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> in the flesh. It felt
no different than when she came in a dream.</p>

<p>She ducked outside. A three-quarter moon shone down
on tents where no fire burned and no one moved, on a Cairhien that
seemed oddly distant and clouded in shadow. All that remained was
the problem of actually getting to Salidar. She had thought about
that. A great deal depended on whether she had as much control in
the flesh as when she was part of the World of Dreams.</p>

<p>Fixing in her mind what she would find, she walked
around the tent&mdash;and smiled. There stood Bela, the short
shaggy mare she had ridden out of the Two Rivers a lifetime ago.
Only a dream-Bela, but the stout mare tossed her nose and whickered
at sight of her.</p>

<p>Egwene dropped her burdens and flung her arms around
the horse&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you again, too,&rdquo; she
whispered. That dark liquid eye looking at her <em>was</em>
Bela&rsquo;s, reflection or no.</p>

<p>Bela wore the high-cantled saddle she had imagined,
too. Comfortable for long travel normally, but not soft. Egwene
eyed the thing askance, wondering how it would look padded; then
she had a thought. You could change anything in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> if you knew how, even yourself. If
she had enough control to make Bela while in the flesh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she
concentrated on herself.</p>

<p>With a smile she fastened the saddlebags and bundle
behind the saddle and climbed up herself, settling quite
comfortably. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t cheating,&rdquo; she told the mare. &ldquo;They
would not expect me to ride all the way to Salidar like that.&rdquo;
Well, come to think of it, maybe they would. Even so, Aiel heart or
no Aiel heart there were limits. Turning Bela, she heeled the
mare&rsquo;s ribs gently. &ldquo;I need to be as quick as I can, so you
will need to run like the wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before she had time to chuckle at the image that came
to mind of plump Bela running like the wind, the mare was doing so.
The landscape blurred, streaking by. For a moment Egwene clung to
the pommel of the saddle, her mouth hanging open. It was as if
Bela&rsquo;s every trotting step carried them miles. With the first
she had an instant to realize they were on the riverbank below the
city, with ships floating out on the dark waters amid streaks of
moonlight, and even as she tried to jerk at the reins, to stop Bela
running headlong into the river, another step took them into
thicketed hills.</p>

<p>Egwene threw back her head and laughed. This was
marvelous! Except for the blurring, there was little real sensation
of speed; her hair hardly had time to stream back in the wind of
that rush before it was gone, only to come again a moment later.
Bela&rsquo;s gait felt the same plodding trot she recalled, but the
sudden leap of everything around her was exhilarating, one moment a
village street, moon-dark and silent, the next a country road
winding through hills, the next a meadow with hay standing almost
to Bela&rsquo;s shoulders. Egwene only paused now and again to
orient herself&mdash;no trouble at all with that marvelous map in
her head, the one the woman with Siuan&rsquo;s name had made&mdash;and otherwise let Bela trot. Villages and towns appeared and
vanished in a blur, great cities&mdash;one she thought sure was
Caemlyn, walls silvery white in the night&mdash;and once, in
forested hills, the head and shoulders of a huge statue rearing out
of the earth, a remnant of some land lost in history, appearing so
suddenly at Bela&rsquo;s side with a weathered grimace that Egwene
nearly screamed, only it was gone before she could. The moon did
not move at all between leaps, and hardly any as they sped along. A
day or two to reach Salidar? That was what Sheriam had said. The
Wise Ones were right. Everyone had believed for so long that Aes
Sedai knew everything that Aes Sedai believed it, too. She was
going to prove them wrong tonight, but it was not likely they would
take any real notice of her proof. They <em>knew</em>.</p>

<p>After a time, when she was sure she was somewhere
well into Altara, she began letting Bela make smaller jumps,
reining her in more often, even riding normally for a bit,
especially if there was a village nearby. Sometimes a
night-shrouded inn had a sign that named the village, the Marella
Inn or the Ionin Spring Inn, and moonlight added to the odd sense
of light in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> made reading them
easy. Bit by bit she became absolutely certain where she was in
relation to Salidar and began to take still smaller leaps, then
none at all, only letting Bela trot normally through forest where
tall trees had killed most of the undergrowth and drought most of
the rest.</p>

<p>Still, she was surprised when a considerable village
appeared suddenly, silent and dark in the moonlight. It had to be
the right place, though.</p>

<p>At the edge of the thatch-roofed stone houses, she
dismounted and took down her belongings. It was late, but people
might still be about in the waking world. No need to startle them
by popping out of the air. If an Aes Sedai saw that and mistook
what she was, she might have no chance to face the Hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did run like the wind,&rdquo; she murmured, hugging
Bela a last time. &ldquo;I wish I could take you with me.&rdquo; A useless
fancy, of course. What was made in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> could exist only there. This was not
really Bela, after all. Even so, she felt a twinge of regret as she
turned her back&mdash;she would not stop imagining Bela; let her
exist as long as she could&mdash;and wove her shimmering curtain
of Spirit. Head high, she stepped through, ready to face whatever
came with her Aiel heart.</p>

<p>One step she took, and came up short with a sharp,
wide-eyed, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; The changes she had made in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> existed in the real world no more
than Bela did. The flames returned with a rush, and with them, it
was almost as though Sorilea spoke to her. <em>If you take what you
did to meet your</em> toh <em>and make it so it might as well never have
happened, how have you met</em> toh? <em>Remember your Aiel heart,
girl</em>.</p>

<p>Yes. She would remember. She was here to do battle
whether the Aes Sedai knew it or not, ready to fight for the right
to be Aes Sedai, ready to face&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;light, what?</p>

<p>There were people in the streets, a few moving
between houses where lighted windows made golden pools. Walking a
little gingerly, Egwene approached a wiry woman with a white apron
and a harried expression. &ldquo;Excuse me. My name is Egwene
al&rsquo;Vere. I am Accepted&rdquo;&mdash;the woman gave her riding dress
a sharp look&mdash;&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve just arrived. Can you
direct me to Sheriam Sedai? I need to find her.&rdquo; Very likely
Sheriam was asleep already, but if she was, Egwene intended to wake
her. She had been told to come as soon as possible, and Sheriam was
going to know she was here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everyone comes to me,&rdquo; the woman muttered. &ldquo;Does
anybody do anything for themselves? No, they want Nildra to do it.
You Accepted are the worst of the lot. Well, I don&rsquo;t have all
night. Follow me, if you&rsquo;re coming. If not, you can find her
for yourself.&rdquo; Nildra strode off without so much as a backward
glance.</p>

<p>Egwene followed silently. If she opened her mouth,
she was afraid she would tell the woman what she thought, and that
would hardly be the way to start her stay in Salidar. However short
it might be. She wished her Aiel heart and her Two Rivers head
could get together.</p>

<p>The distance was not long, up the hard-packed dirt
street a little way and around the corner into another, narrower
street. Sounds of laughter came from some of the houses. Nildra
stopped at one that was silent, though light shone in the windows
of the front room.</p>

<p>Pausing just long enough to knock on the door, she
went in before there was any answer. Her curtsy was perfectly
proper, if quick, and she spoke in a somewhat more respectful tone
than before. &ldquo;Aes Sedai, this girl says her name is Egwene, and she&mdash;&rdquo; She got out no more.</p>

<p>They were all there, the seven from the Heart of the
Stone, not a one looking ready for bed, though all but the young
woman with Siuan&rsquo;s name wore robes. From the way their chairs
were pulled together, it seemed that Egwene had walked in on a
discussion. Sheriam was the first to leap from her chair, waving
Nildra out. &ldquo;Light, child! Already?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one paid any mind at all to Nildra&rsquo;s curtsy,
or her put-upon sniff on going.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We never expected,&rdquo; Anaiya said, taking
Egwene&rsquo;s arms with a warm smile. &ldquo;Not so soon. Welcome, child.
Welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were there any ill effects?&rdquo; Morvrin demanded. She
had not risen, and neither had Carlinya or the young Aes Sedai, but
Morvrin leaned forward intently. All the others&rsquo; robes were
silk of various hues, sometimes brocaded or embroidered; hers was
plain brown wool, though it did look soft and finely woven. &ldquo;Do you
feel any changes from the experience? We had precious little to go
on. Frankly, I am surprised it worked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall have to see it work to know how well it
does.&rdquo; Beonin paused for a sip of tea, then set cup and saucer down
on a rickety-legged side table. The cup and saucer did not match,
but then, none of the furniture matched, and most looked as
lopsided as the small table. &ldquo;If there are ill effects, she can be
Healed, and they will be done with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene stepped away from Anaiya quickly, setting her
belongings beside the door. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m quite well. Really, I
am.&rdquo; She could have hesitated; Anaiya might well have Healed her
without asking. That would have been cheating, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She appears healthy enough,&rdquo; Carlinya said coolly.
Her hair really was short, dark curls barely covering her ears; it
had not been just something she did in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. She wore white, of course; even the
embroidery was white. &ldquo;We can have one of the Yellows check her
thoroughly later, to be sure, if need be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her get her feet on the ground,&rdquo; Myrelle said
with a laugh. Lush flowers in yellow and red so covered her robe
that hardly any green showed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just come a thousand
leagues in a night. In hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no time to let her find her feet,&rdquo; the
young Aes Sedai put in firmly. She truly looked out of place in
that gathering, in her yellow dress with the skirts slashed with
blue and the deep round neckline blue-embroidered. That, and being
the only one it was possible to put an age to. &ldquo;Come morning, the
Hall will swarm around her. If she&rsquo;s not ready, Romanda will
gut her like a fat carp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene gaped. That voice registered more than the
words. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Siuan Sanche. No, it&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is possible, all right,&rdquo; Anaiya said dryly,
giving the young woman a long-suffering look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Siuan is Aes Sedai again.&rdquo; Myrelle&rsquo;s look was
more exasperated than long-suffering.</p>

<p>It had to be true&mdash;they <em>had</em> said so&mdash;but Egwene could hardly credit it even when Sheriam
explained. Nynaeve had Healed <em>stilling</em>! Being <em>stilled</em> was
why Siuan looked no older than Nynaeve? Siuan had always been a
leather-faced taskmistress, and leather-hearted as well, not this
pretty, creamy-cheeked woman with an almost delicate mouth.</p>

<p>Egwene watched Siuan while Sheriam talked. Those blue
eyes were the same, though. How could she have seen that gaze,
strong enough to drive nails, and not known? Well, the face was
answer enough there. But Siuan had always been strong in the Power,
too. When a girl first began, it required testing to tell how
strong she would be, but not once she had gained that strength.
Egwene knew enough now to weigh another woman in moments. Sheriam
was clearly the strongest woman in the room aside from Egwene
herself, and Myrelle next, though it was hard to be certain; the
rest all seemed close, except for Siuan. She was weakest by a fair
margin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This truly is Nynaeve&rsquo;s most remarkable
discovery,&rdquo; Myrelle said. &ldquo;The Yellows are taking what she has done
and making their own marvels, but she began it. Sit down, child. It
is too long a story to hear standing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I prefer to stand, thank you.&rdquo; Egwene eyed the
straight-backed chair with a wooden seat that Myrelle indicated,
and barely repressed a shudder. &ldquo;What about Elayne? Is she all
right, too? I want to hear all about her and Nynaeve both.&rdquo;
Nynaeve&rsquo;s <em>most</em> remarkable discovery? That implied
more than one. It seemed she had fallen behind with the Wise Ones;
she was going to have to run hard to catch up. At least she thought
now that she would be allowed to. They would hardly have greeted
her so warmly if she was going to be sent away in disgrace. She had
not curtsied or called anyone Aes Sedai once&mdash;more because
she had had no chance than for any other reason; defiance was no
way to face Aes Sedai&mdash;yet no one had called her down. Maybe
they did not know after all. But then, why?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except for a little trouble she and Nynaeve have
with pots at the moment,&rdquo; Sheriam began, but Siuan broke in
harshly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you all jabbering like brainless girls?
It&rsquo;s too late to be afraid of going on. It has begun; you
began it. Either you finish, or Romanda will hang the lot of you in
the sun to dry right alongside this girl, and Delana and Faiselle and
the rest of the Hall will be there with her to stretch you
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheriam and Myrelle turned to face her almost
together. All the Aes Sedai did, Morvrin and Carlinya twisting in
their chairs. Cold Aes Sedai eyes stared from cold Aes Sedai
faces.</p>

<p>At first Siuan met those stares with a challenging
stare of her own, as Aes Sedai as they if seemingly much younger.
Then her head fell a little, and spots of color entered her cheeks.
She rose from her chair, eyes down. &ldquo;I spoke in haste,&rdquo; she
muttered softly. Those eyes did not change&mdash;maybe the Aes
Sedai failed to notice, but Egwene saw&mdash;yet that was still
not like Siuan.</p>

<p>Egwene also saw that she did not know what was going
on here at all. Not just Siuan Sanche meek as milk; if she was
pushed to it, anyway. That least of all. What had they begun? Why
would <em>she</em> be hung out to dry if they stopped?</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai exchanged looks as unreadable as Aes
Sedai could make them. Morvrin was the first to nod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been summoned for a very special reason,
Egwene,&rdquo; Sheriam said solemnly.</p>

<p>Egwene&rsquo;s heart began to beat faster. They did
not know about her. They did not. But what?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; Sheriam said, &ldquo;are to be the next Amyrlin
Seat.&rdquo;</p>
