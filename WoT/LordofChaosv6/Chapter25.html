some reason, when Cowinde came to wake her in the
gray before dawn, Egwene felt refreshed despite her dreams.
Refreshed and ready to see what she could learn in the city. One
long yawn and stretch, and she was on her feet, humming as she
washed and dressed hurriedly, hardly taking the time to brush her
hair properly. She would have hurried away from the tents without
wasting time on breakfast, but Sorilea saw her, and that put an
abrupt end to that notion. Which turned out to be just as well.</p>

carefully. &ldquo;There are a good many Aes Sedai, after all, and I
haven&rsquo;t been a full sister long enough to know many.&rdquo; Heads
nodded; they accepted that. &ldquo;Nesune Bihara is fair-minded&mdash;she listens to all sides before reaching a conclusion&mdash;but
she can find even the smallest flaw in what you
