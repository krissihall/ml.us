rolled across the low, brown grassland hills
in a continuous peal, though the sky held not a cloud, only the
burning sun, still with a way to climb. On a hilltop, Rand held the
reins and the Dragon Scepter on the pommel of his saddle and
waited. The thunder swelled. It was hard not to look over his
shoulder constantly, south toward Alanna. She had bruised her heel
this morning and scraped her hand, and she was in a temper. How and
what for, he had no notion; he had no real notion how he could be
so sure. The thunder crested.</p>

<p>The Saldaean horsemen appeared over the next rise,
three abreast at a dead gallop in a long snake that kept coming,
down the slope into the broad sweep between the hills. Nine
thousand men made a very long snake. At the foot of the slope they
divided, the center column coming on while the others peeled off to
right and left, each column dividing again and again until they
rode by hundreds, swooping past one another. Riders began standing
on their saddles, sometimes on feet, sometimes on hands. Others
swung impossibly low to slap the ground on first one side of their
galloping mounts, then the other. Men left their saddles entirely
to crawl underneath speeding horses, or dropped to the ground to
run a pace beside the animal before leaping back into the saddle,
then dropping on the other side to repeat the performance.</p>

<p>Rand lifted his reins and heeled Jeade&rsquo;en. As
the dapple moved, so did the Aiel surrounding him. This morning the
men were Mountain Dancers, <em>Hama N&rsquo;dore</em>, more than
half wearing the headband of <em>siswai&rsquo;aman</em>. Caldin,
graying and leathery, had tried to get Rand to let him bring more
than twenty, what with so many armed wetlanders about; none of the
Aiel wasted any time with disparaging looks for Rand&rsquo;s sword.
Nandera spent more time watching the two hundred-odd women who
trailed after them on horses; she seemed to find more threat in
the Saldaean ladies and officers&rsquo; wives than in the soldiers,
and having met some of the Saldaean women, Rand was not ready to
argue. Sulin would probably have agreed. It occurred to him that he
had not seen Sulin in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;not since returning from Shadar Logoth.
Eight days. He wondered if he had done something to offend her.</p>

<p>This was no time to worry about Sulin or <em>
ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>. He circled around the valley until he
reached the hilltop over which the Saldaeans had first appeared to
him. Bashere himself rode about down there examining first one
group as they went through their paces, then another; almost
coincidentally, he just happened to do this standing up on his
saddle.</p>

<p>For an instant Rand seized <em>saidin</em>, and
released it a heartbeat later. With his vision enhanced, it had not
been difficult to see the two white stones lying near the foot of
the slope, right where Bashere had placed them personally last
night, four paces apart. With luck, no one had seen him. With luck,
no one would ask too many questions about this morning. Below, some
men were riding two horses now, a foot on each saddle, still at a
dead gallop. Others had a man on their shoulders, sometimes in a
handstand.</p>

<p>He looked around at the sound of a horse walking
toward him. Deira ni Ghaline t&rsquo;Bashere rode through the Aiel
with seeming unconcern; armed only with a small knife at her silver
belt, in a riding dress of gray silk embroidered in silver down the
sleeves and on the high neck, she appeared to be daring them to
attack her. As tall as many of the Maidens, nearly a hand taller
than her husband, she was a big woman. Not stout, nor even plump;
simply big. She had wings of white in her black hair, and her dark
tilted eyes were fixed on Rand. He suspected she was a beautiful
woman when his presence did not turn her face to granite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is my husband&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>amusing</em> you?&rdquo; She never
gave Rand a title, never used his name.</p>

<p>He looked at the other Saldaean women. They watched
him like a troop of cavalry ready to charge, faces also granite,
tilted eyes icy. All they awaited was Deira&rsquo;s command. He
could well believe the stories of Saldaean women taking up fallen
husbands&rsquo; swords and leading their men back into battle. Being
pleasant had gotten him exactly nowhere with Bashere&rsquo;s wife;
Bashere himself only shrugged and said she was a difficult woman at
times, all the while grinning with what could only be pride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell Lord Bashere I am pleased,&rdquo; he said. Turning
Jeade&rsquo;en, he started back toward Caemlyn. The Saldaean
women&rsquo;s eyes seemed to press against his back.</p>

<p>Lews Therin was giggling; that was the only word for
it. <em>Never prod at a woman unless you must. She will kill you
faster than a man and for less reason, even if she weeps over it
after</em>.</p>

<p><em>Are you really there?</em> Rand demanded. <em>Is
there more to you than a voice?</em> Only that soft, mad laughter
answered.</p>

<p>He stewed over Lews Therin all the way back to
Caemlyn, and even after they had ridden past one of the long
markets of tile roofs lining the approaches to the gates and into
the New City. He worried over going mad&mdash;not just the fact of
it, though that was bad enough; if he went insane, how could he do
what he had to do?&mdash;but he had seen no sign of it. But then,
if his mind did crack, would he know it? He had never seen a
madman. All he had to go by was Lews Therin maundering in his head.
Did all men go mad alike? Would he end like that, laughing and
weeping over things no one else saw or knew? He knew he had a
chance to live, if a seemingly impossible one. <em>If you would
live, you must die</em>; that was one of three things he knew must
be true, told to him inside a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> where the
answers were always true if apparently never easy to understand.
But to live like that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;he was not sure he would not rather
die.</p>

<p>The crowds in the New City gave way before more than
forty Aiel, and a handful recognized the Dragon Reborn as well.
Maybe more did, but it was a ragged handful of cheers that went up
as he rode by. &ldquo;The Light shine on the Dragon Reborn!&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
glory of the Light for the Dragon Reborn!&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Dragon Reborn,
King of Andor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That last one jolted him whenever he heard it, and he
heard it more than once. He had to find Elayne. He could feel his
teeth grinding. He could not look at the people in the street; he
wanted to smash them to their knees, roar at them that Elayne was
their queen. Trying not to hear, he studied the sky, the rooftops,
anything but the crowd. And that was why he saw the man in a white
cloak rise up on a red-tiled rooftop and lift a crossbow.</p>

<p>Everything happened in heartbeats. Rand seized <em>
saidin</em> and channeled as the bolt flew toward him; it struck
Air, a silvery blue mass hanging above the street, with a clang as
of metal against metal. A ball of fire leaped from Rand&rsquo;s
hand, struck the crossbowman in the chest as the bolt was bouncing
away from the shield of Air. Flames engulfed the man, and he fell
shrieking from the rooftop. And someone leaped into Rand, carrying
him out of the saddle.</p>

<p>He hit the paving stones hard with a weight atop him;
breath and <em>saidin</em> left him together. Struggling for air,
he wrestled with the weight, wrenched it off&mdash;and found
himself holding Desora by the arms. She smiled at him, a beautiful
smile; then her head slumped sideways. Sightless blue eyes stared
at him, already glazing. The crossbow bolt standing out from her
ribs pressed against his wrist. Why had she ever wanted to hide
such a beautiful smile?</p>

<p>Hands seized him, hauled him to his feet; Maidens and
Mountain Dancers pushed him to the side of the street, close
against the front of a tinsmith&rsquo;s shop, and formed a tight,
veiled circle around him, horn bows in hand, eyes searching street
and rooftops. Shouts and screams rang everywhere, but the street
was already clear for better than fifty paces either way, and then
it was a milling mass of people struggling to get away. The street
was clear except for bodies. Desora, and six others, three of them
Aiel. One more a Maiden, he thought. It was hard to be sure from a
distance with someone lying crumpled like a heap of rags.</p>

<p>Rand moved, and the Aiel around him pressed together
more tightly, a wall of flesh. &ldquo;These places are rabbit warrens,&rdquo;
Nandera said conversationally, without letting her eyes stop their
search above her veil. &ldquo;If you join the dance in there, you can
take a blade in the back before you know there is danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Caldin nodded. &ldquo;This reminds me of a time near Sedar
Cut, when&mdash;We have a prisoner, at least.&rdquo; Some of his <em>
Hama N&rsquo;dore</em> had appeared from a tavern across the street,
pushing ahead of them a man with his arms and elbows bound behind
him. He continued to struggle until they shoved him to his knees on
the paving stone and laid spearpoints against his throat. &ldquo;Perhaps
he will tell us who commanded this.&rdquo; Caldin sounded as though he
did not doubt it in the least.</p>

<p>A moment later Maidens came out of another building
with a second bound man who was limping, his face covered in blood.
In short order four men knelt in the street under Aiel guard.
Finally the semicircle hemming Rand loosened.</p>

<p>The four were hard-faced men all, though the
blood-smeared fellow swayed and rolled his eyes at the Aiel. Two
others wore sullen defiance, the fourth a sneer.</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s hands twitched. &ldquo;Are you sure they were
part of it?&rdquo; He could not believe how soft his voice sounded, how
steady. Balefire would solve everything. <em>Not balefire</em>,
Lews Therin panted at him. <em>Never again</em>. &ldquo;Are you
sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were,&rdquo; a Maiden said; he could not see who,
behind her veil. &ldquo;Those we killed all wore this.&rdquo; She tugged a
cloak free from behind the bloodied man&rsquo;s bound arms. A worn
white cloak, grimy and stained, with a golden sunburst embroidered
on the chest. The other three had them too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These were set to watch,&rdquo; a broad Mountain Dancer
added, &ldquo;and report if the attack went badly for the others.&rdquo; He
laughed, a short bark. &ldquo;Whoever sent them did not know how badly it
would go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of these men fired a crossbow?&rdquo; Rand asked.
Balefire. <em>No</em>, Lews Therin shrieked in the distance. The
Aiel exchanged glances, shook <em>shoufa</em>-wrapped heads. &ldquo;Hang
them,&rdquo; Rand said. The bloody-faced man nearly collapsed. Rand
seized him in flows of Air, dragged him to his feet. It was the
first he realized that he held <em>saidin</em>. He welcomed the
struggle for survival; he even welcomed the taint, staining his
bones like acid slime. It made him less aware of things he would
rather not remember, emotions he would rather not have. &ldquo;What is
your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;F-Faral, m-my Lord. D-Dimir Faral.&rdquo; Eyes almost
popping out of his head stared at Rand through that mask of blood.
 &ldquo;P-Please don&rsquo;t h-hang me, m-my Lord. I&rsquo;ll w-walk in the
Light, I s-swear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a very lucky man, Dimir Faral.&rdquo; Rand&rsquo;s
voice sounded as distant in his own ears as Lews Therin&rsquo;s
cries. &ldquo;You are going to watch your friends hang.&rdquo; Faral began to
weep. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll be given a horse, and you will go tell
Pedron Niall that one day I will hang him too for what happened
here.&rdquo; When he loosed the flows of Air, Faral collapsed in a heap,
moaning that he would ride to Amador without stopping. The three
who were to die stared contemptuously at the sobbing man. One of
them spat at him.</p>

<p>Rand put them out of his mind. Niall was the only one
he had to remember. There was something else he had to do yet. He
pushed away <em>saidin</em>, went through the struggle to escape it
without being obliterated, the struggle to make himself release it.
For what he had to do, he wanted no screen between him and his
emotions.</p>

<p>A Maiden was straightening Desora&rsquo;s body; she
had raised Desora&rsquo;s veil. She reached to stop him when he
touched that piece of black <em>algode</em> then hesitated,
looking at his face, and settled back on her haunches.</p>

<p>Lifting the veil, he memorized Desora&rsquo;s face.
She looked as if she were sleeping now. Desora, of the Musara sept
of the Reyn Aiel. So many names. Liah, of the Cosaida Chareen,
and Dailin, of the Nine Valleys Taardad, and Lamelle, of the Smoke
Water Miagoma, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;so many. Sometimes he ran down that list
name by name. There was one name in it he had not added. Ilyena
Therin Moerelle. He did not know how Lews Therin had put it there,
but he would not have erased it if he knew how.</p>

<p>It was both an effort and a relief to turn away from
Desora, a pure relief to find that what he had thought was a second
dead Maiden was instead a man, short for an Aielman. He hurt for
the men who died for him, but with them he could remember an old
saying. &ldquo;<em>Let the dead rest, and care for the living</em>.&rdquo; Not
easily, but he could make himself do it. He could not even make
himself summon the words when it was a woman who had died.</p>

<p>Skirts spread on the paving stones caught his eye.
Not only Aiel had died.</p>

<p>She had taken a crossbow bolt squarely between the
shoulder blades. Almost no blood stained the back of her dress; it
had been quick, a small mercy. Kneeling, he turned her over as
gently as he could; the other end of the bolt stood out from her
chest. It was a square face, a woman in her middle years, a touch
of gray in her hair. Her dark eyes were open wide; she looked
surprised. He did not know her name, but he memorized her face. She
had died for being on the same street with him.</p>

<p>He caught at Nandera&rsquo;s arm, and she shook his
hand free, not wanting the use of her bow impaired, but she did
look at him. &ldquo;Find this woman&rsquo;s family and see they have
whatever they need. Gold&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; It was not enough. What they
needed was a wife back, a mother back; he could not give them that.
 &ldquo;See to them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And find out her name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nandera stretched a hand toward him, then put it back
to her bow. When he stood, the Maidens were watching him. Oh, they
were watching everything as usual, but those veiled faces turned
toward him a little more often. Sulin knew how he felt, if she did
not know about the list, but he had no idea whether she had told
the others. If she had, he had no idea how they felt about it.</p>

<p>Walking back to where he had fallen, he picked up the
tasseled Dragon Scepter. Bending was an effort, and the short
length of spear felt heavy. Jeade&rsquo;en had not gone far once his
saddle was empty; the horse was well trained. Rand climbed onto the
dapple&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done as much as I can here,&rdquo; he said&mdash;let them think whatever they wanted&mdash;and dug in his
heels.</p>

<p>If he could not outdistance memory, he outdistanced
the Aiel. For a time at least. He had handed Jeade&rsquo;en over to
a stableman and was inside the Palace before Nandera and Caldin
caught up to him, with about two-thirds the number of Maidens and
Mountain Dancers they had had. Some had been left to care for the
dead. Caldin looked sourly irritated. From the heat in
Nandera&rsquo;s eyes, Rand thought he should be glad she was not
veiled.</p>

<p>Before she could speak, Mistress Harfor approached
Rand and curtsied deeply. &ldquo;My Lord Dragon,&rdquo; she said in a deep,
strong voice, &ldquo;there is a petition for audience with you from the
Wavemistress of Clan Catelar, of the Atha&rsquo;an Miere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the fine cut of Reene&rsquo;s red-and-white dress
was not enough to say that &ldquo;first maid&rdquo; was a misnomer, her manner
certainly was. A slightly plump woman with graying hair and a long
chin, she looked Rand right in the eye, tilting her head back to
manage it, and somehow combined a proper degree of deference, an
utter lack of obsequiousness, and an aloofness most noblewomen
could not attain. Like Halwin Norry, she had stayed when most
others fled, though Rand half-suspected that her motive had been to
defend and preserve the Palace from invaders. He would not have
been surprised to learn that she periodically searched his chambers
for hidden Palace valuables. He would not have been surprised to
learn she tried to search the Aiel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sea Folk?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What do they want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave him a patient look, trying to make
allowances. Very plainly trying. &ldquo;The petition does not say, my
Lord Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Moiraine had known anything about the Sea Folk,
she had not made it part of his education, but from Reene&rsquo;s
attitude, this woman was important. A Wavemistress certainly
sounded important. That would mean the Grand Hall. He had not been
there since returning from Cairhien. Not that he had any reason to
avoid the throne room; there just had been no need to go there.
 &ldquo;This afternoon,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;Tell her I will see her in the
mid-afternoon. You&rsquo;ve given her good apartments? And her
retinue?&rdquo; He doubted anyone with so grand a title traveled
alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She refused them; they have taken rooms at The Ball
and Hoop.&rdquo; Her mouth flattened slightly; apparently, however lofty
a Wavemistress, that was not proper in Reene Harfor&rsquo;s eyes.
 &ldquo;They were very dusty and travel-sore, hardly able to stand. They
came by horse, not coach, and I do not believe they are used to
horses.&rdquo; She blinked as if surprised to have unbent that much, and
regained her reserve like donning a cloak. &ldquo;Someone else wishes to
see you, my Lord Dragon.&rdquo; Her tone picked up the faintest hint of
distaste. &ldquo;The Lady Elenia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand almost grimaced himself. No doubt Elenia had
another lecture prepared on her claims to the Lion Throne; so far
he had managed not to hear more than one word in three. She would
be easy enough to turn down. Still, he really should know something
of Andor&rsquo;s history, and no one handy knew more of it than
Elenia Sarand. &ldquo;Send her to me in my rooms, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really mean the Daughter-Heir to have the
throne?&rdquo; Reene&rsquo;s tone was not harsh, but all deference was
gone. Her face had not changed, yet Rand was sure that with a wrong
answer she would shout &ldquo;For Elayne and the White Lion!&rdquo; and try to
bash his brains in, Aiel or no Aiel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;The Lion Throne is Elayne&rsquo;s.
By the Light and my hope of rebirth and salvation, it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reene studied him a moment, then spread her skirts in
another deep curtsy. &ldquo;I will send her to you, my Lord Dragon.&rdquo; Her
back was stiff as she glided away, but it always was; there were no
telling whether she believed a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A crafty enemy,&rdquo; Caldin said heatedly before Reene
had gone five paces, &ldquo;will set a weak ambush you are meant to break
through. Confident because you have dealt with the threat, your
guard relaxed, you walk into the second, stronger ambush.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Right on top of Caldin, Nandera said in a cold voice,
 &ldquo;Young men can be impetuous, young men can be rash, young men can
be fools, but the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> cannot let himself
be a young man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand glanced over his shoulder before starting off,
just long enough to say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re back inside the Palace now.
Choose your two.&rdquo; It was little surprise that Nandera and Caldin
chose themselves, and none at all that they strode after him
wrapped in a hard silence.</p>

<p>At the door to his apartments, he told them to send
Elenia in when she came and left them in the corridor. There was
plum punch in a silver-chased pitcher waiting, but he did not touch
it. Instead he stood staring at it, trying to plan out what he was
going to say, until he realized what he was doing and grunted in
surprise. What was there to plan?</p>

<p>A tap at the door announced honey-haired Elenia, who
swept a curtsy in a dress worked with golden roses. On any other
woman, Rand would have thought they were just roses; on Elenia,
they had to stand for the Rose Crown. &ldquo;My Lord Dragon is most
gracious to receive me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to ask you some things about Andor&rsquo;s
history,&rdquo; Rand said. &ldquo;Will you take plum punch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elenia&rsquo;s eyes widened in delight before she
could stop them. Undoubtedly she had planned how to work Rand
around to this in order to lead into her claims, and here it was
handed to her. A smile bloomed on her foxlike face. &ldquo;May I have the
honor of pouring for my Lord Dragon?&rdquo; she said, not waiting for him
to wave his assent. She was so pleased with the turn of events that
he almost expected her to press him into a chair and urge him to
put his feet up. &ldquo;Upon what point of history may I shed light?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A general sort of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Rand frowned; that would
give the excuse to be listing her ancestry in detail inside of two
sentences &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that is, how Souran Maravaile came to bring his
wife here. Was he from Caemlyn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ishara brought Souran, my Lord Dragon.&rdquo;
Elenia&rsquo;s smile turned briefly indulgent. &ldquo;Ishara&rsquo;s mother
was Endara Casalain, who was Artur Hawkwing&rsquo;s governor here
then&mdash;the province was called Andor&mdash;and also the
daughter of Joal Ramedar, the last King of Aldeshar. Souran was
only&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;only a general&rdquo;&mdash;she had been going to say a
commoner; he would have wagered on it&mdash;&ldquo;though
Hawkwing&rsquo;s finest, of course. Endara resigned her warrant and
knelt to Ishara as Queen.&rdquo; Somehow, Rand did not believe it had
happened quite that way, or so smoothly. &ldquo;They were the worst of
times, of course, quite as bad as the Trolloc Wars, I am sure. With
Hawkwing dead, every noble thought to become High King. Or High
Queen. Ishara knew that no one would be able to take it all,
though; there were too many factions, and alliances broke as soon
as made. She convinced Souran to raise the siege of Tar Valon, and
brought him and as much of his army as he could hold together
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Souran Maravaile was the one besieging Tar Valon?&rdquo;
Rand said, startled. Artur Hawkwing had laid a twenty-year siege
against Tar Valon, and put a price on the head of every Aes
Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The final year of it,&rdquo; she said, a touch
impatiently, &ldquo;as nearly as the histories record.&rdquo; It was plain she
had little real interest in Souran except as Ishara&rsquo;s husband.
 &ldquo;Ishara was wise. She promised the Aes Sedai that her eldest
daughter would be sent to study in the White Tower, thus gaining
the Tower&rsquo;s backing and an Aes Sedai advisor named Ballair,
the first ruler to do so. Others did follow, of course, but they
still wanted Hawkwing&rsquo;s throne.&rdquo; She had the bit in her teeth
now, face animated, goblet forgotten, gesturing with her free hand.
Words bubbled out. &ldquo;A full generation passed before that idea died,
although Narasim Bhuran did try as late as the last ten years of
the War of the Hundred Years&mdash;a dismal failure that ended
with his head on a pike after a year&mdash;and Esmara
Getares&rsquo;s effort some thirty years earlier gained considerable
ground before she tried to conquer Andor and spent the last twelve
years of her life as the <em>guest</em> of Queen Telaisien. Esmara
was assassinated in the end, though there is no record of why
anyone would want her dead once Telaisien broke her power. You see,
the Queens who came after Ishara, from Alesinde to Lyndelle,
followed what she had begun, and not only in sending a daughter to
the Tower. Ishara had Souran secure the land around Caemlyn first,
only a few villages in the beginning, then slowly expanded her
control. Why, it took five years for her sway to reach the River
Erinin. But the land that Andor&rsquo;s Queens held was solidly
theirs when most others who called themselves kings or queens were
still more interested in gaining new lands than in solidifying what
they already had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused for breath, and Rand leaped in quickly.
Elenia spoke of these people as if she knew them personally, but
his head was spinning with names he had never heard before. &ldquo;Why is
there no House Maravaile?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of Ishara&rsquo;s sons lived past twenty.&rdquo;
Elenia shrugged and sipped her punch; the subject did not interest
her. But it did give her a new topic. &ldquo;Nine queens reigned over the
course of the War of the Hundred Years, and none had a son live
beyond twenty-three. The battles were constant, and Andor was
pressed from every side. Why, in Maragaine&rsquo;s reign, four
kings brought armies against her&mdash;there is a town named for
the battle, on the site. The kings were&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But all the queens have been descendants of Souran
and Ishara?&rdquo; Rand put in quickly. The woman would give him a
day-by-day account if he let her. Sitting, he motioned her to take
a chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said reluctantly. Probably reluctant to
include Souran. But she brightened immediately. &ldquo;You see, it is a
matter of how much of Ishara&rsquo;s blood one has. How many lines
connect you to her, and in what degree. In my case&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t easy for me to understand. For
example, take Tigraine and Morgase. Morgase had the best claim to
succeed Tigraine. I suppose that means Morgase and Tigraine were
closely related?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were cousins.&rdquo; Elenia made an effort to hide
her irritation over being interrupted so often, especially now that
she was so close to the heart of what she wanted to say, but her
mouth still narrowed. She looked like a fox that wanted to bite,
but the chicken kept slipping just out of reach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Cousins. Rand drank deeply, half-emptying
his goblet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are all cousins. All the Houses.&rdquo; His silence
seemed to invigorate her. Her smile returned. &ldquo;With marriages over
a thousand years, there is not a House without some drop of
Ishara&rsquo;s blood. But the degree is what is important, that and
the number of connecting lines. In my case&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand blinked. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re <em>all</em> cousins? <em>
All</em> of you? That doesn&rsquo;t seem poss&mdash;&rdquo; He leaned
forward intently. &ldquo;Elenia, if Morgase and Tigraine had been&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;merchants, or farmers&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;how closely would they have been
related?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farmers?&rdquo; she exclaimed, staring at him. &ldquo;My Lord
Dragon, what a peculiar&mdash;&rdquo; The blood drained slowly from her
face; he had been a farmer, after all. She wet her lips, a nervous
flicker of the tongue. &ldquo;I suppose&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I should have to think.
Farmers. I suppose that means imagining all the Houses as farmers.&rdquo;
A nervous titter broke from her before she drowned it in her punch.
 &ldquo;Had they been farmers, I don&rsquo;t think anyone would consider
them related at all. All the connections are too far back. But they
were not, my Lord Dragon&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped listening with more than half an ear and
sank back in his chair. Not related.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;have thirty-one lines to Ishara, while Dyelin
has only thirty, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why did he feel so relaxed suddenly? Knots had
vanished from his muscles that he had not even known were there
until they went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;if I may say so, my Lord Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Forgive me. My mind wandered for a moment&mdash;the problems of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I missed the last thing you said.&rdquo;
There had been something in it that had tugged at his ear,
though.</p>

<p>Elenia wore the obsequious, flattering smile that
looked so strange on her face. &ldquo;Why, I was just saying that you
yourself bear some resemblance to Tigraine, my Lord Dragon. You
might even have some touch of Ishara&rsquo;s blood your&mdash;&rdquo; She
cut off with a squeak, and he realized he was on his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;feel a little tired.&rdquo; He tried to make his
voice normal, but it sounded as distant as if he were deep in the
Void. &ldquo;If you would leave me, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not know how his face looked, but Elenia
bounced out of her chair, hurried to set her goblet on the table.
She was trembling, and if her face had been bloodless before, now
it looked like snow. Dropping a curtsy deep enough for a scullery
maid caught stealing, she hurried toward the door, each step faster
than the last, all the while watching him over her shoulder, until
she tore the door open and the sound of running slippers receded
down the hall. Nandera put her head in, checking on him, before
pulling the door shut.</p>

<p>For a long time Rand stood staring at nothing. No
wonder those ancient queens had been staring at him; they knew what
he was thinking when he did not himself. That sudden worm of worry
that had gnawed at him unseen since he discovered his mother&rsquo;s
real name. But Tigraine had not been related to Morgase. His mother
had not been related to Elayne&rsquo;s mother. He was not related to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re worse than a lecher,&rdquo; he said aloud,
bitterly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fool and a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He wished Lews Therin
would speak, so he could say to himself, <em>That is a madman; I am
sane</em>. Was it those dead rulers of Andor he felt staring at
him, or was it Alanna? Striding to the door, he jerked it open.
Nandera and Caldin were sitting on their heels beneath a tapestry
of brightly colored birds. &ldquo;Assemble your people,&rdquo; he told them.
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to Cairhien. Please don&rsquo;t tell Aviendha.&rdquo;</p>
