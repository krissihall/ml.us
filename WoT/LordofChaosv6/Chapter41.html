<h4><em>A Threat</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">R</span>iding
slowly through Caemlyn under a baking
mid-morning sun, Min really saw little of the city. She hardly
noticed the people and sedan chairs, wagons and coaches, that
clogged the streets except to guide her bay mare around them. One
of her dreams had always been to live in a great city and travel to
strange places, but today colorful towers covered in glittering
tiles and sweeping vistas as the street rounded a hill passed all
but unseen. Clumps of Aiel striding through the crowds with space
opening around them got a second glance, and so did patrols of
hawk-nosed, often bearded men on horseback, but only because they
reminded her of the stories they had begun hearing while still in
Murandy. Merana had been angered by those, and by the charred
evidence of Dragonsworn they had come on twice, but Min thought
some of the other Aes Sedai were worried. The less said about what
they thought of Rand&rsquo;s amnesty, the better.</p>

<p>At the edge of the plaza in front of the Royal
Palace, she drew Wildrose&rsquo;s rein and blotted her face
carefully with a lace-edged handkerchief that she tucked back up
her coatsleeve. Only a few people dotted the great oval, perhaps
because Aiel guarded the open main gates of the palace. More Aiel
stood on marble balconies or glided across high, colonnaded walks
like leopards. The White Lion of Andor stirred in a breeze above
the tallest of the palace domes. Another crimson flag flew from one
of the spires, a little lower than the white dome, lifted just
enough by the breeze for her to make out the ancient symbol of Aes
Sedai, black-and-white.</p>

<p>Those Aiel made her glad she had refused the offer of
a pair of Warders as escort; she suspected Aiel and Warders might
strike sparks. Well, it had not been precisely an offer, and she
had refused by sneaking away an hour before time by the clock on
the inn mantelpiece. Merana was from Caemlyn, and when they arrived
before dawn she took them straight to what she said was the finest
inn in the New City.</p>

<p>It was not the Aiel who kept Min sitting there,
however. Not entirely, though she had heard all sorts of terrible
stories about black-veiled Aiel. Her coat and breeches were the
finest, softest wool that could be found in Salidar, in a pale
rose, with tiny blue-and-white flowers embroidered on lapels and
cuffs and down the outsides of the legs. Her shirt was cut like a
boy&rsquo;s too, but in cream silk. In Baerlon, after her father
died, her aunts had tried to make her into what they called a
decent proper woman, though maybe her Aunt Miren had understood
that after ten years running about the mines in boys&rsquo; clothes,
it might be too late to stuff her into dresses. They had tried,
even so, and she had fought them as stubbornly as she refused to
learn to wield a needle. Aside from that unfortunate episode
serving tables at The Miners&rsquo; Rest&mdash;a rough place, but
she had not stayed long; Rana, Jan <em>and</em> Miren had seen to
that emphatically when they found out, and no matter that she was
twenty then&mdash;aside from that one time, she had never worn a
dress willingly. Now she was thinking that maybe she should have
had one made instead of this coat and breeches. A dress in silk,
cut snug at the bodice and low, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>He&rsquo;ll have to take me as I am</em>, she
thought, twitching the reins irritably. <em>I&rsquo;m not changing
for any man</em>. Only, her clothes would have been as plain as any
farmer&rsquo;s not that long ago, her hair had not been in ringlets
almost to her shoulders, and a small voice whispered, <em>
You&rsquo;ll be whatever you think he wants you to be</em>. She
kicked it down as hard as she had ever kicked any stableman who
tried to cut rough, and heeled Wildrose only a little more gently.
She hated the very idea of women being weak when it came to men.
There was just one problem; she was fairly certain she was going to
find out just what it was like very soon now.</p>

<p>Dismounting in front of the Palace gates, she patted
the mare, to tell her she had not meant the kick, while eyeing the
Aiel uncertainly. Half were women, all but one considerably taller
than she. The men towered like Rand, most of them, and some even
more. Every one was watching her&mdash;well, they seemed to be
watching everything, but definitely her as well&mdash;and not one
blinked that she could see. With those spears and bucklers, the
bows on their backs and quivers at their hips, the heavy knives,
they looked ready to kill. Those black strips of cloth hanging down
onto their chests must be the veils. She had heard Aiel would not
kill you without covering their faces. <em>I hope that&rsquo;s
so.</em></p>

<p>She addressed herself to the shortest of the women.
Framed by bright red hair as short as Min&rsquo;s used to be, her
tanned face might as well have been carved from wood, but she was
even a little shorter than Min. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to see Rand
al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; Min said, a trifle unsteadily. &ldquo;The Dragon Reborn.&rdquo;
Did none of them ever blink? &ldquo;My name is Min. He knows me, and I
have an important message for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The red-haired woman turned to the other Aiel,
gesticulating quickly with her free hand. The rest of the women
laughed as she turned back. &ldquo;I will take you to him, Min. But if he
does not know you, you will leave much faster than you go in.&rdquo; Some
of the Aiel women laughed at that too. &ldquo;I am called Enaila.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He knows me,&rdquo; Min told them, flushing. She had a
pair of knives up her coatsleeves that Thom Merrilin had showed her
how to use, but she had the feeling this woman could take them away
and peel her with them. An image flickered above Enaila&rsquo;s head
and was gone. A wreath of some sort; Min had no idea what it meant.
 &ldquo;Am I supposed to take my horse in, too? I don&rsquo;t think Rand
wants to see her.&rdquo; To her surprise, some of the Aiel chuckled, men
and women, and Enaila&rsquo;s lips twitched as if she wanted to.</p>

<p>A man came to take Wildrose&mdash;Min thought he was
Aiel too, despite the downcast eyes and white robe&mdash;and she
followed Enaila through the gates, across a broad courtyard and
into the Palace proper. It was something of a relief to see
servants in red-and-white livery scurrying along the tapestry-lined
corridors, warily eyeing the Aiel who also walked the halls, but no
more so than they might a strange dog really. She had begun to
think she would find the Palace filled with none but Aiel, Rand
surrounded by them, maybe dressed in coat and breeches all in
shades of brown and gray and green, staring at her without
blinking.</p>

<p>Before tall wide doors, carved with lions and
standing open, Enaila halted, wiggling her hand quickly at the Aiel
on guard. They were all women. One, flaxen-haired and considerably
taller than most men, waggled fingers back. &ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo; Enaila
said, and went in.</p>

<p>Min took one step after her, and a spear was casually
held in her path by the flaxen-haired woman. Or perhaps not
casually, but Min did not care. She could see Rand.</p>

<p>He sat on a great gilded throne that seemed made
entirely of Dragons, in a red coat worked heavily with gold,
holding some sort of green-and-white tasseled spearhead of all
things. Another throne stood on a tall pedestal behind him, gilded
also, but with a lion picked out in white gemstones against red.
The Lion Throne, so the rumors said. At that moment, he could have
been using it for a footstool for all she cared. He looked tired.
He was so beautiful, her heart ached. Images danced around him
continuously. With Aes Sedai and Warders, that deluge was something
she tried to escape; she could not tell what they meant any more
often than with anyone else, but they were <em>always</em> there.
With Rand, she had to make herself see them, because otherwise she
would just stare at his face. One of those images she had seen
every time she saw him. Countless thousands of sparkling lights,
like stars or fireflies, rushed into a great blackness, trying to
fill it up, rushed in and were swallowed. There seemed to be more
lights than she had ever seen before, but the darkness swallowed
them at a greater rate, too. And there was something else,
something new, an aura of yellow and brown and purple that made her
stomach clench.</p>

<p>She tried viewing the nobles facing him&mdash;surely
that was what they were, in all those fine embroidered coats and
rich silk gowns&mdash;but there was nothing to see. That was true
of most people most of the time, and when she did see something,
most often she had no notion what it foretold. Even so, she
narrowed her eyes, straining. If she could make out just one image,
one aura, it might be a help to him. From the stories she had heard
since entering Andor, he could use all the help he could find.</p>

<p>With a heavy sigh, she gave it up finally. Squinting
and straining did no good unless there was something to see in the
first place.</p>

<p>Suddenly she realized the nobles were withdrawing,
Rand was on his feet, and Enaila was waving, motioning her to
enter. Rand was smiling. Min thought her heart might burst out of
her chest. So this was what it felt like for all those women she
had laughed at, throwing themselves at a man&rsquo;s feet. No. She
was not a giddy girl; she was older than he, she had had her first
kiss while he still thought getting out of tending sheep was the
most fun in the world, she&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>Light, please, don&rsquo;t let
my knees give way</em>.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Tossing the Dragon Scepter down carelessly where he
had been sitting, Rand bounded from the dais in one leap and rushed
down the Grand Hall. As soon as he reached Min, he caught her under
the arms and swung her into the air and around and around before
Dyelin and the others were gone. Some of the nobles stared, and
were welcome to for all of him. &ldquo;Light, Min, but it&rsquo;s good to
see your face,&rdquo; he laughed. Considerably better than Dyelin&rsquo;s
stony features or Ellorien&rsquo;s. But if Aemlyn and Arathelle and
Pelivar and Luan and all of them had every one proclaimed their joy
that Elayne was on her way to Caemlyn instead of staring at him
with doubt or even &ldquo;liar&rdquo; in their eyes, he would have been as
overjoyed to see Min.</p>

<p>When he put her feet back on the floor, she sagged
against his chest, clutching his arms and breathing hard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to make you dizzy. It&rsquo;s
just that I really am glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you did make me dizzy, you wool-headed
sheepherder,&rdquo; she mumbled against his chest. Pushing herself away,
she glared up at him through long lashes. &ldquo;I had a very long ride,
I arrived in the middle of the night, or might as well, and you
toss me around like a sack of oats. Did you never learn any
manners?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Woolhead,&rdquo; he laughed softly. &ldquo;Min, you can name me
liar, but I&rsquo;ve actually missed hearing you call me that.&rdquo; She
did not call him anything; she merely peered up at him, the glare
gone completely. Her eyelashes did seem longer than he
remembered.</p>

<p>Realizing where they were, he took her hand. A throne
room was no place for meeting old friends. &ldquo;Come on, Min. We can
have some cool punch in my sitting room. Somara, I am going to my
apartments; you can send everybody away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somara did not look happy about it, but she dismissed
all the Maidens except for herself and Enaila. Both looked a bit
sullen, which he did not understand. He had allowed Somara to
gather so many inside the palace in the first place only because
Dyelin and the others were coming. Bashere was out at his
horsemen&rsquo;s camp north of the city for the same reason. Maidens
for a reminder, Bashere because there could be too many reminders.
He hoped the two Maidens were not planning on any mothering. They
took turns as his guards more than their share, it seemed to him,
but Nandera was as adamant as Sulin had been when it came to him
saying who specifically was to do what. He could command <em>Far
Dareis Mai</em>, but he was not a Maiden, and the other was none of
his business.</p>

<p>Min studied the tapestries as he led her along the
corridor by the hand. She peered at inlaid chests and tables, at
golden bowls and tall vases of Sea Folk porcelain in niches. She
examined Enaila and Somara head to toe three times each. But she
neither looked at him nor spoke a word. His hand engulfed hers, and
he could feel the pulse in her wrist racing to beat horses. He
hoped she was not really angry over being whirled about.</p>

<p>To his great relief, Somara and Enaila took places on
either side of his door, though they both looked at him when he
asked for punch, and he had to repeat himself. In the sitting room,
he took off his coat and tossed it over a chair. &ldquo;Sit, Min. Sit.
Rest and relax. The punch will be here shortly. You have to tell me
everything. Where you&rsquo;ve been, how you got here, why you
arrived in the night. It isn&rsquo;t safe traveling at night, Min.
Now less than ever. I&rsquo;ll give you the best rooms in the Palace&mdash;well, the second-best; these are the best&mdash;and an Aiel
escort to take you wherever you want. Any bullyboy or strongarm
will doff his cap and duck his head, if he doesn&rsquo;t run right
up the side of a building to get away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment he thought she might laugh, standing
there by the door, but instead she drew a deep breath and took a
letter from her pocket. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you where I came from&mdash;I promised, Rand&mdash;but Elayne is there, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Salidar,&rdquo; he said, and smiled at the way her eyes
widened. &ldquo;I know a few things, Min. Maybe more than some think I
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;see that you do,&rdquo; she said faintly. She
pushed the letter into his hands then backed away again. Her voice
firmed as she added, &ldquo;I swore I would give that to you first off.
Go ahead and read it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He recognized the seal, a lily in dark yellow wax,
and Elayne&rsquo;s flowing hand in his name, and he hesitated before
opening it. Clean breaks were best, and he had made one, but with
the letter in his hand, he could not stop himself. He read, then
sat down atop his coat and read again. It was certainly short.</p>

<p class="note">Rand,</p>

<p class="note">I have made my feelings clear to you. Know that they
have not changed. I hope that you feel for me what I feel for you.
Min can help you, if you will only listen to her. I love her like a
sister, and hope you love her as I do.</p>

<p class="note_sig">Elayne</p>

<p>Her ink must have been running out, because the last
lines were a hurried scrawl, quite unlike the elegance of the rest.
Min had been sidling and twisting her head, trying to read the
letter without being too obvious, but when he lifted himself to
pull his coat out&mdash;the fat-little-man <em>angreal</em> was in
the pocket&mdash;she scurried back again. &ldquo;Do women all <em>
try</em> to drive a man crazy?&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stared at the letter, talking half to himself.
 &ldquo;Elayne is so beautiful I can&rsquo;t help staring, but half the
time I don&rsquo;t know whether she wants me to kiss her or kneel at
her feet. Truth to tell, sometimes I did want to kneel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and
worship, the Light help me. She says here I know how she feels. Two
letters she&rsquo;s written me before this, one full of love, the
other saying she never wanted the sight of me again. The times
I&rsquo;ve sat wishing the first one was true and the other some
sort of joke, or mistake, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and Aviendha. She&rsquo;s
beautiful too, but every day with her was a battle. No kisses from
her, not anymore, and no doubts how she feels. She was even happier
to get away from me than I was to see her go. Only, I keep
expecting to see her when I turn around, and when she isn&rsquo;t
there, it&rsquo;s as if something inside me is missing. I actually
miss the battle, and there are moments when I find myself thinking,
<em>There are things worth fighting for</em>.&rdquo; Something in
Min&rsquo;s silence made him look up. She was staring at him with a
face as blank as an Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did nobody ever tell you it isn&rsquo;t polite to
talk to one woman about another?&rdquo; Her voice was absolutely flat.
 &ldquo;Much less two other women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Min, you&rsquo;re a friend,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think of you as a woman.&rdquo; It was the wrong thing to say;
he knew it as soon as the words left his mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Tossing back her coat, she placed her hands on
her hips. It was not the all-too-familiar angry pose. Her wrists
were twisted so her fingers pointed up, and somehow that made it
very different. She stood with one knee bent, and that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;for
the first time he really saw her; not just Min, but the way she
looked. Not the usual plain brown coat and breeches, but pale red,
and embroidered. Not the usual rough-cut hair that barely covered
her ears, but ringlets brushing her neck. &ldquo;Do I look like a
boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Min, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I look like a man? A horse?&rdquo; In one quick stride
she reached him and plumped herself down in his lap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Min,&rdquo; he said, aghast, &ldquo;what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Convincing you I&rsquo;m a woman, woolhead.
Don&rsquo;t I look like a woman? Don&rsquo;t I smell like a woman?&rdquo;
She smelled faintly of flowers, now that he noticed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I
feel&mdash;? Well, enough of that. Answer the question,
sheepherder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the &ldquo;sheepherder&rdquo; and &ldquo;woolhead&rdquo; that stilled
his alarm. The truth was, she felt remarkably nice sitting there.
But she was Min, who thought he was a country boy with hay in his
hair and not very much common sense. &ldquo;Light, Min, I know
you&rsquo;re a woman. I didn&rsquo;t mean any insult. You&rsquo;re a
friend, too. It&rsquo;s just that I feel comfortable with you. It
doesn&rsquo;t matter if I look like a fool with you. I can say
things to you I wouldn&rsquo;t say to anybody else, not even Mat or
Perrin. When I am around you, all the knots unwind, all the
tightness in my shoulders I don&rsquo;t even feel till it goes. Do
you see, Min? I like being around you. I&rsquo;ve missed you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Folding her arms, she looked at him sideways,
frowning. Her leg twitched; if her foot had reached the floor, she
would have been tapping it. &ldquo;All that about Elayne. And this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Aviendha. Who is she, by the way? It sounds to me as if you love
them both. Oh, stop jerking about. You owe me some answers. Saying
I&rsquo;m not&mdash;just answer me. Do you love both of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I do,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;Light help me, I think
maybe I do. Does that make me a lecher, Min, or just a greedy
fool?&rdquo; Her mouth opened and closed; she tossed her head angrily and
compressed her lips. He hurried on before she could tell him which
one she had picked to fit him; he did not really want to hear it
from her. &ldquo;It hardly matters now anyway. It is done with. I sent
Aviendha away, and I will not let her come back. I won&rsquo;t let
myself within a mile of her or Elayne, ten miles if I can help
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the love of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! Why, Rand? What gives you the
right to make a choice like that for them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Min, can&rsquo;t you see? I am a target. Any woman I
love becomes a target, too. Even if the arrow is aimed at me, it
could hit her. It could be aimed at her.&rdquo; Breathing out heavily, he
leaned back with his arms on the rose-carved chair arms. She
twisted a little, studying him with the most serious expression he
had ever seen on her face. Min was always smiling, always a little
amused by everything. Just as well she was not now; he was deadly
serious himself. &ldquo;Lan told me he and I are alike in some ways, and
it&rsquo;s true. He said there are men who radiate death. Himself.
Me. When a man like that falls in love, the best gift he can give
her is to put as much distance as possible between himself and her.
You see that, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I see&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She was silent for a moment.
 &ldquo;Very well. I&rsquo;m your friend, and I am glad you know it, but
don&rsquo;t bother thinking I will give up. I will convince you I am
not a man or a horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Min, I said I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sheepherder. Not good enough.&rdquo; She wriggled
round on his lap in a way that made him clear his throat, and
pinned a finger against his chest. &ldquo;I want tears in your eyes when
you say it. I want drool on your chin and a stammer in your voice.
You needn&rsquo;t think I won&rsquo;t make you pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand could not help laughing. &ldquo;Min, it really is good
to have you here. All you see is a mudfoot from the Two Rivers,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her mood changed lightning quick. &ldquo;I see you, Rand,&rdquo;
she said, strangely quiet. &ldquo;I see you.&rdquo; Clearing her throat, she
arranged herself primly, hands on her knees. If it was possible to
be prim sitting as she was, anyway. &ldquo;I might as well get on with
why I came. Apparently, you know about Salidar. That is going to
raise a few eyebrows, I tell you. What you probably do not know is
that I didn&rsquo;t come alone. There&rsquo;s an embassy from Salidar
in Caemlyn, to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lews Therin muttered, thunder in the distance.
Mention of Aes Sedai always roused him since Alanna and the
bonding, if not as much as being around Taim.</p>

<p>Even with Lews Therin grumbling, Rand very nearly
smiled. He had suspected as soon as Min handed him the letter from
Elayne. Confirmation was almost as good as proof that they were
frightened, as he thought. What else could they be, rebels driven
to hiding right on the edge of Whitecloak power? Very likely
wishing they knew how to creep back into the White Tower, too,
chewing their fingers over how to wriggle back into Elaida&rsquo;s
good graces. From what he knew of Elaida, they had small chance,
and they had to know it better than he. If they had sent an embassy
to the Dragon Reborn, to a man who could channel, then they must be
all but ready to accept his protection. This was not like Elaida,
who apparently thought he could be bought, and likely kept in a
wicker cage like a song sparrow. Egwene&rsquo;s nebulous promises of
Aes Sedai who supported him were about to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who came with you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Maybe I know her.&rdquo; He
did not really know any Aes Sedai except Moiraine, who was dead,
but he had met a few. If she was one of those, it might make things
a little harder. He really had been Min&rsquo;s farmboy back then,
ready to flinch if an Aes Sedai looked at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more than one, Rand. Actually, there
are nine.&rdquo; He gave a start, and she went on quickly. &ldquo;It is meant
for an honor, Rand; three times what they&rsquo;d send a king or
queen. Merana&mdash;she&rsquo;s in charge; she&rsquo;s Gray Ajah&mdash;Merana will come here alone this afternoon, and no more than
one at a time will come anywhere near you unless you feel
comfortable. They took rooms at The Crown of Roses, in the New
City; they practically took it over, with all the Warders and
servants. Merana sent me first because I know you, to smooth the
way. They don&rsquo;t mean you any harm, Rand. I am sure of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A viewing, Min, or your opinion?&rdquo; It seemed odd to
be carrying on a serious conversation with a woman perched on his
knee, but she was Min, after all. That made it different. He just
had to keep reminding himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My opinion,&rdquo; she admitted reluctantly. &ldquo;Rand, I
viewed every one of them every day, all the long way from Salidar.
If they intended any harm, I would have to have seen something. I
can&rsquo;t believe nothing would show in that time.&rdquo; Shifting, she
gave him a worried look that quickly changed to a determined
firmness. &ldquo;I might as well tell you something else while I&rsquo;m
about it. I saw an aura around you in the throne room. Aes Sedai
are going to hurt you. Women who can channel, anyway. It was all
confused; I&rsquo;m not sure about the Aes Sedai part. But it might
happen more than once. I think that&rsquo;s why it seemed all
scrambled.&rdquo; He looked at her silently, and she smiled. &ldquo;I like that
about you, Rand. You accept what I can do and what I cannot. You
don&rsquo;t ask me if I&rsquo;m sure, or when it&rsquo;s going to
happen. You never ask for more than I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am to ask one thing, Min. Can you be sure
these Aes Sedai in your viewing aren&rsquo;t the Aes Sedai you came
with?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said simply. That was one thing <em>he</em>
liked; she never tried to evade.</p>

<p><em>I have to be careful</em>, Lews Therin whispered
intently. <em>Even these half-trained girls can be dangerous with
nine of them. I must&mdash;</em></p>

<p><em>I must</em>, Rand thought firmly. A moment of
confusion from Lews Therin, and then he fled back to the shadowed
recesses. He always did now, if Rand spoke to him. The only problem
was that Lews Therin seemed to be seeing and hearing more, and
intending to act on it. There had not been another incident of his
trying to seize <em>saidin</em>, but Rand was careful now. The man
wanted Rand&rsquo;s mind and body for his own, thought they were his
own, and if he managed to gain control even once, Rand was not
certain it would not be just that way. Lews Therin Telamon walking
and speaking, while Rand al&rsquo;Thor was only a voice in his
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand,&rdquo; Min said anxiously, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t look at me
like that. I am on your side, if it comes to sides. It might, a
little. They think I&rsquo;ll tell them what you say. I won&rsquo;t,
Rand. They just want to know how to deal with you, what to expect,
but I&rsquo;ll not tell one word you don&rsquo;t want me to, and if
you ask me to lie, I will. They do not know about my viewings.
Those are yours, Rand. You know I will read anyone you say,
including Merana and the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He forced the snarl from his face, made sure his
voice was mild. &ldquo;Calm yourself, Min. I know you are on my side.&rdquo;
That was simple truth. Suspecting Min would be like suspecting
himself. Lews Therin was dealt with for the moment; it was time to
deal with this Merana and her embassy. &ldquo;Tell them they can come
three at a time.&rdquo; That was what Lews Therin had advised in
Cairhien; no more than three at once. The man seemed to believe he
could handle three Aes Sedai. He seemed more than a little
contemptuous of those who called themselves Aes Sedai now. But what
had been a limit in Cairhien was different here. Merana wanted him
calmed and smoothed down before even one Aes Sedai came near. Let
her chew on an invitation for three to begin and think what it
might mean. &ldquo;Aside from that, none are to enter the Inner City
without my permission. And they aren&rsquo;t to try channeling
around me. Tell them that, Min. I&rsquo;ll know the moment they take
hold of the Source, and I will not be pleased. Tell them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t going to be very pleased either,
sheepherder,&rdquo; she said dryly. &ldquo;But I will tell them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A crash whipped Rand&rsquo;s head around.</p>

<p>Sulin stood just inside the door in her red-and-white
dress, her face so suffused with blood that the scar on her cheek
stood out even paler than usual. Her white hair had grown since she
put on the livery, but it was still shorter than any of the
servants&rsquo;. Mistress Harfor had had it made into a close cap of
curls. Sulin hated that. At her feet was a silver tray bordered in
worked gold, with silver-chased golden goblets lying on their
sides. The wine pitcher rocked a last time as he looked, and
miraculously stopped upright, though there appeared to be as much
wine punch on tray and carpet as there could be remaining in the
pitcher.</p>

<p>Min was halfway into scrambling to her feet when he
caught her by the waist and pulled her back down. Time enough and
more to drive home that he was done with Aviendha, and Min would
not mind helping. In fact, after a moment of resistance, she leaned
into him and put her head on his chest. &ldquo;Sulin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a good
servant does not toss trays about. Now, pick it up and do as you&rsquo;re supposed to.&rdquo;
Staring at him darkly, she all but quivered.</p>

<p>Figuring out how to let her meet her <em>toh</em>
while discharging at least some of his obligation to her had been
little short of brilliant. Sulin cared for his rooms now, and
fetched and carried only for him. She hated it, of course,
especially that he saw her doing it every day, but she no longer
broke her back scrubbing floors all over the Palace or hauling
endless streams of heavy water buckets for laundry. He suspected
she would rather every Aiel this side of the Dragonwall saw her
shame than allow him to, but he had eased her labors notably, eased
his conscience somewhat, and if having to work for him made her
decide her <em>toh</em> was met sooner, all to the good. Sulin
belonged in <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em> carrying her spears, not in
livery folding bed linens.</p>

<p>Picking up the tray, she stalked across the room and
pushed it roughly onto an ivory-inlaid table. As she started to
turn away, he said, &ldquo;This is Min, Sulin. She&rsquo;s my friend. She
doesn&rsquo;t know Aiel ways, and I would take it amiss should
anything untoward happen to her.&rdquo; It had just occurred to him that
the Maidens might have their own view of him sending away Aviendha
and holding another woman almost as soon as she was gone. Their own
view, and their own way of dealing with it. &ldquo;In fact, if any harm
comes to her, I&rsquo;ll consider it done to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should any but Aviendha wish to harm this
woman?&rdquo; Sulin said grimly. &ldquo;She gave too much time to dreaming over
you, and not enough to teaching you what you should know.&rdquo; Giving
herself a shake, she growled, &ldquo;My Lord Dragon.&rdquo; He thought it was
supposed to be a murmur. She nearly fell over twice in her
curtsy before she was upright again, and she slammed the door on
her way out.</p>

<p>Min twisted her head to look up at him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think I have ever seen a maid like&mdash;Rand, I believe
she&rsquo;d have stabbed you if she had a knife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kick me, maybe,&rdquo; he chuckled, &ldquo;but never stab. She
thinks I am her long-lost brother.&rdquo; Confusion clouded Min&rsquo;s
eyes; he could see a hundred questions rising. &ldquo;It is a long story.
I will tell you another time.&rdquo; Part of it, he would. Nobody was
ever going to know what he had to put up with from Enaila and
Somara and a few others. Well, the Maidens all knew already, but no
one else.</p>

<p>Melaine entered in the Aiel way, which was to say she
put her head in at the door, looked around, then followed with the
rest of her. He had never puzzled out what would make an Aiel
decide not to come in. Chiefs, Wise Ones and Maidens had walked in
on him in his smallclothes, in his bed, his bath. Coming closer,
the sun-haired Wise One settled herself cross-legged on the carpet
a few paces in front of him in a clatter of bracelets and arranged
her skirts around her with care. Green eyes regarded Min
neutrally.</p>

<p>This time Min made no effort to get up. In fact, from
the way she was lying against him, head pressed against his chest,
breathing slowly, he was not sure she might not be falling asleep.
After all, she had said she had reached Caemlyn in the night.
Suddenly he became conscious of his hand fitted in the hollow of
her waist, and moved it firmly to the arm of the chair. She sighed
almost regretfully and snuggled against him. Going to sleep without
a doubt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have news,&rdquo; Melaine said, &ldquo;and I am uncertain
which is the most important. Egwene has gone from the tents. She
goes to a place called Salidar, where there are Aes Sedai. These
are the Aes Sedai who may uphold you. At her asking, we did not
speak to you of them before, but now I will tell you they are
forward, undisciplined, contentious and full of themselves beyond
reason.&rdquo; Her tone was heated toward the end, and her head was
thrust forward.</p>

<p>So one of the dreamwalkers in Cairhien had spoken to
Melaine in her dreams. That was about all he knew of the
dreamwalkers&rsquo; skills, and while it could have been useful,
they were seldom willing to put it at his disposal. What was
different was all that about forward and so forth. Most Aiel
behaved as if they thought Aes Sedai might strike them, believed
they would deserve it if so, and intended to take the blow without
flinching. Even Wise Ones spoke of Aes Sedai respectfully if at
all. Clearly a few things had changed. All he said, though, was &ldquo;I
know.&rdquo; If Melaine had any intention of telling him why, she would
without his asking. If she did not, asking would get no answers.
 &ldquo;About Egwene, and Salidar too. There are nine from Salidar in
Caemlyn right now. Min here came with them.&rdquo; Min stirred on his
chest and murmured something. Lews Therin was grumbling again, just
too low to make out, and Rand was glad of the distraction. Min felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;good. She would be offended to the sky if she knew. Then
again, considering her promise to make him pay, she might laugh.
Maybe. She could be quicksilver at times.</p>

<p>Melaine showed no surprise at his knowledge, not even
shifting her shawl. Since marrying Bael she seemed to have&mdash;&ldquo;calmed&rdquo; was not quite the right word; it was much too placid for
Melaine&mdash;grown less excitable. &ldquo;That was my second news. You
must be wary of them, Rand al&rsquo;Thor, and use a firm hand. They
will respect nothing else.&rdquo; Most definitely a change.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have two daughters,&rdquo; Min murmured. &ldquo;Twins
like mirrors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Melaine had been unsurprised before, she made up
for it now. Her eyes went wide, and she gave a start that nearly
lifted her from the floor. &ldquo;How could you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; she began
incredulously, then stopped to gather herself. Even so, she went on
in a breathless voice. &ldquo;I myself was uncertain I was with child
until this morning. How could you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min did get up then, giving him a look he knew all
too well. It was his fault for some reason. She was not entirely
without flaws, if small ones. Fussing with her coat, she looked
everywhere except at Melaine, and when her gaze fell on him again,
it was a variation of the first look. He had gotten her into this;
it was up to him to get her out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all right, Min,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a Wise
One, and I expect she knows things that would curl your hair.&rdquo;
Except that already was curly. How did women do that, anyway? &ldquo;I am
sure she will promise to keep your secret, and you can trust her
promise.&rdquo; Melaine almost stumbled over her tongue promising.</p>

<p>Just the same, Rand received another look before Min
sat down beside Melaine. Reproachful, maybe. How <em>did</em> she
expect him to get her out of it? Melaine would not forget because
he asked, but she would keep a promise, and a secret. She had kept
enough from him.</p>

<p>For all her reluctance, once Min began she gave a
much fuller explanation than she had ever given him at one time,
perhaps helped by the other woman&rsquo;s constant questions, and
Melaine&rsquo;s changing attitude as well. It was as if Melaine
began to feel that Min&rsquo;s ability made her an equal of sorts,
not at all a wetlander.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is remarkable,&rdquo; Melaine said at last. &ldquo;Like
interpreting the dream without dreaming. Two, you say? Both girls?
Bael will be so pleased. Dorindha has given him three sons, but we
both know he would like a daughter.&rdquo; Min blinked and gave her head
a hard shake. Of course; she could not know about sister-wives.</p>

<p>From there the two of them passed quickly on to
childbirth itself. Neither had ever borne a child, but each had
helped midwives.</p>

<p>Rand cleared his throat loudly. It was not that any
of the details bothered him. He had helped ewes lamb, mares foal
and cows calve. What was irritating was that they sat there with
their heads together as though he had ceased to exist. Neither
looked around until he cleared his throat again, loud enough that
he wondered whether he had strained something.</p>

<p>Melaine leaned closer to Min and spoke in a whisper
that could have been heard in the next room. &ldquo;Men always
faint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And always at the worst possible time,&rdquo; Min agreed
in the same tone.</p>

<p>What would they think if they could have seen him in
Mat&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s barn, blood and birthing fluids to his
shoulders and three ribs cracked where he had been kicked because
the mare had never foaled before and was frightened? A fine colt
that had been, and the mare had not kicked at all the next
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before I faint,&rdquo; he said wryly, joining them on the
carpet, &ldquo;perhaps one of you would like to say some more about the
Aes Sedai?&rdquo; He would have stood up or sat on the floor before this
had his lap not been full. Among the Aiel, only chiefs had chairs,
and a chief&rsquo;s chair was only used for things like pronouncing
judgments or receiving the submission of an enemy.</p>

<p>Both women were suitably chastened. Neither said
anything, but there was ample shifting of shawl, adjusting of coat
and not quite meeting his eye. All that vanished once they got down
to talking. Min held tenaciously to her opinion that the Aes Sedai
from Salidar meant no harm to Rand and might give aid, suitably
handled, which was with all respect in public and in private her
reporting to Rand every whisper she overheard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not being
a traitor, you understand, Melaine. I knew Rand before any Aes
Sedai except Moiraine, really, and the truth of it is, he took my
loyalty long before she died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Melaine did not think Min a traitor, quite the
contrary, and seemed to think even better of her. Wise Ones did
have their own version of the Aiel view of spies. But she argued
that with notable exceptions, Aes Sedai could be trusted as far as
Shaido, which was to say not until they had been taken captive and
made <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>. She did not exactly suggest captivity
for the Aes Sedai at The Crown of Roses, but she did not miss far.
 &ldquo;How can you trust them, Rand al&rsquo;Thor? I think they have no
honor, except for Egwene al&rsquo;Vere, and she&mdash;&rdquo; Melaine
twitched her shawl again. &ldquo;When an Aes Sedai shows me she has as
much honor as Egwene, I will trust her, and not before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For his part, Rand listened more than spoke, and
saying no more than a dozen or so words, learned a great deal.
Answering Melaine&rsquo;s arguments, Min ran through the embassy
name by name, listing what each woman had said about support for
Rand, and in truth admitting that all was not exactly rosy. Merana
Ambrey and Kairen Stang, a Blue, were both Andoran, and for all
that Aes Sedai supposedly forsook all allegiances save the White
Tower, perhaps because they were estranged from the Tower, they
worried that Rand sat in Caemlyn and might have murdered Morgase.
Rafela Cindal, also Blue Ajah, might be pleased with the changes
Rand had made in Tear, where once channeling had been outlawed and
a girl found able to learn was hurried out of the country, but she
said little, and Morgase worried her too. Seonid Traighan, a Green,
mulled over every rumor from her native Cairhien and kept her own
counsel, and Faeldrin Harella, the second Green sister, sometimes
compared Dragonsworn atrocities in Altara and Murandy to what
Dragonsworn had done in Tarabon, refusing even to talk about the
fact that civil war had ripped her land apart before the first man
had sworn to the Dragon there. No matter how Melaine pressed,
though, Min insisted that every one of those Aes Sedai acknowledged
Rand to be the Dragon Reborn and asked her most carefully, all
through the journey from Salidar, what he was like and how he could
best be approached without either offending or frightening him.</p>

<p>Rand grunted at that&mdash;that they were worried
about frightening him&mdash;but Melaine began insisting that if
most of the women in the embassy had so much reason to be against
Rand, then the embassy as a whole surely could not be trusted far
enough to fetch dung for the fire. Min spared him an apologetic
grimace and rushed on. Arad Doman had seen as much of Dragonsworn
as Tarabon, as well as its own civil war, but Demira Eriff, of the
Brown Ajah, only talked of two things really: meeting Rand, and the
rumor that he had started some sort of school in Cairhien; no man
who started a school could be all bad in Demira&rsquo;s eyes.
Berenicia Morsad, a Yellow sister from Shienar, had heard from
Shienarans in Salidar that Rand had been received in Fal Dara by
the great captain Lord Agelmar Jagad, an honor that seemed to carry
considerable weight with her; Lord Agelmar would hardly have
received a ruffian, a fool or a scoundrel. It weighed almost as
heavily with Masuri Sokawa; she was a Brown, from Arafel, which
bordered Shienar. Finally there was Valinde Nathenos, who according
to Min showed an eagerness very unlike the White Ajah to have Rand
drive Sammael out of Illian; a promise of that, a promise even to
try, and Min would not be surprised to see Valinde offer him an
oath of fealty. Melaine expressed disbelief, even rolling her eyes;
she had never seen an Aes Sedai with that much sense, an attitude
Rand found more than surprising considering that she would probably
laugh in his face if he asked for such an oath. Min maintained that
it was true, though, whatever the other woman said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will show them as much respect as I can without
kneeling,&rdquo; Rand told Min when she finally ran down. For Melaine, he
added, &ldquo;And until they show proof of goodwill, I&rsquo;ll trust them
not one jot.&rdquo; He thought that should please them both, since each
got what she wanted, but from the frowns he received, it pleased
neither.</p>

<p>After all that arguing, he half-expected the pair to
be at one another&rsquo;s throats, but it seemed that Melaine&rsquo;s
pregnancy and Min&rsquo;s viewing had created a bond. When they
stood, the women were all smiles and hugs, and Melaine said, &ldquo;I did
not think I would like you, Min, but I do, and I will name one of
the girls after you, because you knew of her first. I must go to
tell Bael so he will not be jealous that Rand al&rsquo;Thor knew
before him. May you always find water and shade, Min.&rdquo; To Rand, she
added, &ldquo;Watch these Aes Sedai closely, Rand al&rsquo;Thor, and give
Min your protection when she needs it. They will harm her if they
learn she is sworn to you.&rdquo; Of course, she left with exactly the
ceremony with which she had arrived, a nod of the head.</p>

<p>Which left him alone with Min again. Which felt
awkward for some reason.</p>
