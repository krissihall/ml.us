<h4><em>From the</em> Stedding</h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">R</span>and
had just begun thumbing tabac into his short
pipe when Liah put her head in at the door. Before she could speak,
a panting round-faced man in red-and-white livery pushed past her,
and fell to his knees before Rand while she stared in
amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Dragon,&rdquo; the fellow burst out in a
breathless squeak, &ldquo;Ogier have come to the Palace. <em>Three</em>
of them! They have been given wine, and offered more, but they
insist only on seeing the Lord Dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand made his voice easy; he did not want to frighten
the man. &ldquo;How long have you been in the Palace&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; The
fellow&rsquo;s livery coat fit him, and he was not young. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid I don&rsquo;t know your name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The kneeling man goggled. &ldquo;My name? Bari, my Lord
Dragon. Uh, twenty-two years, my Lord Dragon, come Winternight. My
Lord Dragon, the Ogier?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand had visited an Ogier <em>stedding</em> twice,
but he was not sure of the proper etiquette. Ogier had built most
of the great cities, the oldest parts of them, and still came out
of their <em>stedding</em> occasionally to make repairs, yet he
doubted Bari would have been this excited for anyone else less than
king or Aes Sedai. Maybe not for them. Rand stuffed pipe and tabac
pouch back into his pocket. &ldquo;Take me to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bari leaped to his feet, all but bouncing on his
toes. Rand suspected he had made the right choice; the man showed
no surprise that the Lord Dragon was going to the Ogier instead of
having them brought to him. He left his sword and the scepter
behind; Ogier would not be impressed by either. Liah and Cassin
came, of course, and it was plain Bari would have run back as well
if not for the necessity of keeping his pace to Rand&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The Ogier waited in a courtyard with a fountain, its
basin filled with lily pads and red and gold fish, a white-haired
man in a long coat that flared above high boots with their tops
turned down, and two women, one noticeably much younger than the
other, their skirts embroidered in vines and leaves, the
elder&rsquo;s considerably more elaborate that the younger&rsquo;s.
Golden goblets made for humans seemed tiny in their hands. Several
trees retained some of their leaves, and the Palace itself gave
shade. The Ogier were not alone; when Rand appeared, Sulin and a
good three dozen Maidens were crowded around them, and Urien, plus
fifty or more Aielmen. The Aiel had the grace to fall silent when
they saw Rand.</p>

<p>The Ogier man said, &ldquo;Your name sings in my ears, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; in a voice like rumbling thunder and gravely made
introductions. He was Haman, son of Dal son of Morel. The older
woman was Covril, daughter of Ella daughter of Soong, and the
younger was Erith, daughter of Iva daughter of Alar. Rand
remembered seeing Erith once, in Stedding Tsofu, a hard two-day
ride from the city of Cairhien. He could not imagine what she was
doing in Caemlyn.</p>

<p>The Ogier made the Aiel seem small; they made the
courtyard seem small. Haman stood over half again as tall as Rand
and broad in proportion, Covril less than a head&mdash;an Ogier
head&mdash;shorter than that, and even Erith topped Rand by nearly
a foot and a half. Yet that was the smallest difference between
Ogier and humans. Haman&rsquo;s eyes were as large and round as
teacups, his broad nose nearly covered his face, and his ears stood
up through his hair, tipped with white tufts. He wore long drooping
white mustaches and a narrow beard beneath his chin, and his
eyebrows hung down to his cheeks. Rand could not have said
precisely how Covril&rsquo;s and Erith&rsquo;s faces differed&mdash;except for lacking beards and mustaches, of course, and their
eyebrows were not quite so long or thick&mdash;but they seemed
somehow more delicate. Though Covril&rsquo;s was quite stern at the
moment&mdash;she looked familiar, too, for some reason&mdash;and
Erith appeared worried, her ears sagging.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will forgive me a moment,&rdquo; Rand told
them.</p>

<p>Sulin did not let him get another word out. &ldquo;We came
to talk with the Treebrothers, Rand al&rsquo;Thor,&rdquo; she said firmly.
 &ldquo;You must know the Aiel have long been waterfriends to the
Treebrothers. We go to trade in their <em>stedding</em> often.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is quite true,&rdquo; Haman murmured. For an Ogier,
it was a murmur. An avalanche somewhere out of sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure the others did come to talk,&rdquo; Rand told
Sulin. He could pick out the members of her guard this morning by
eye, every last one of them; Jalani blushed a deep red. On the
other hand, aside from Urien, no more than three or four of the
morning&rsquo;s Red Shields were there. &ldquo;I would not like to think I
need to ask Enaila and Somara to take <em>you</em> in charge.&rdquo;
Sulin&rsquo;s tanned face darkened with indignation, making the scar
she had taken following him stand out more. &ldquo;I would talk with them
alone. Alone,&rdquo; he emphasized, eyeing Liah and Cassin. &ldquo;Unless you
think I need protection from them?&rdquo; If anything that made her more
offended, and she gathered up the Maidens with quick flashes of
handtalk in what for anyone but an Aiel would surely have been
called a huff. Some of the Aiel men were chuckling as they left;
Rand supposed he had made a joke of some kind.</p>

<p>As they went, Haman stroked his long beard. &ldquo;Humans
have not always thought us so safe, you know. Um. Um.&rdquo; His musing
sounded like a huge bumblebee. &ldquo;It is in the old records. Very old.
Only fragments, really, but dating from just after&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elder Haman,&rdquo; Covril said politely, &ldquo;if we may stick
to the matter at hand?&rdquo; This bumblebee rumbled at a higher
pitch.</p>

<p>Elder Haman. Where had Rand heard that before? Each
<em>stedding</em> had its Council of Elders.</p>

<p>Haman sighed deeply. &ldquo;Very well, Covril, but you are
showing unseemly haste. You barely gave us time to wash before
coming here. I vow, you&rsquo;ve begun to leap about like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;
Those big eyes flickered toward Rand, and he covered a cough with a
hand the size of a large ham. Ogier considered humans hasty, always
trying to do now what could not possibly matter until tomorrow. Or
until next year; Ogier took a very long view. They also thought it
insulting to remind humans of how they leaped about. &ldquo;This has been
a most exacting journey Outside,&rdquo; Haman went on, explaining to
Rand, &ldquo;not the least of it discovering that the Shaido Aiel had
besieged Al&rsquo;cair&rsquo;rahienallen&mdash;most
extraordinary, that&mdash;and that you were actually there, but
then you left before we could speak with you, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I cannot
help feeling we have been impetuous. No. No, you speak, Covril. It
is for you I left my studies, and my teaching, to go running across
the world. My classes will be in riot by now.&rdquo; Rand almost grinned;
the way Ogier normally did things, Haman&rsquo;s classes would take
half a year to decide he really was gone and a year more to discuss
what to do about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mother has some right to be anxious,&rdquo; Covril said,
tufted ears quivering. She seemed to be battling between the
respect due an Elder and a most un-Ogier-like impatience. When she
turned to Rand, she drew herself up, ears standing straight and
chin firm. &ldquo;What have you done with my son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand gaped. &ldquo;Your son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loial!&rdquo; She stared as if he were mad. Erith was
peering at him anxiously, hands clutched to her breast. &ldquo;You told
the Eldest of the Elders of Stedding Tsofu that you would look
after him,&rdquo; Covril marched on. &ldquo;They told me you did. You did not
call yourself Dragon then, but it was you. Wasn&rsquo;t it, Erith?
Did Alar not say Rand al&rsquo;Thor?&rdquo; She did not give the younger
woman time for more than a nod. As her voice picked up speed, Haman
began to look pained. &ldquo;My Loial is too young to be Outside, too
young to be running across the world, doing the things you no doubt
have him doing. Elder Alar told me about you. What has my Loial to
do with the Ways and Trollocs and the Horn of Valere? You will hand
him over to me now, please, so I can see him properly married to
Erith. She will settle his itchy feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very handsome,&rdquo; Erith murmured shyly, her
ears quivering so hard with embarrassment that the dark tufts
blurred. &ldquo;And I think he&rsquo;s very brave, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took Rand a moment to regain his balance mentally.
An Ogier being firm sounded much the same as a mountain falling. An
Ogier being firm and speaking rapidly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By Ogier lights, Loial <em>was</em> too young to have
left the <em>stedding</em> alone, little more than ninety. Ogier
were very long-lived. From the first day Rand had met him, all full
of eagerness to see the world, Loial had been worried over what
would happen when the Elders realized he had run away. Most of all,
he worried about his mother coming after him with a bride in tow.
He said the man had no say in these things among Ogier, and the
woman not much; it was all the two mothers&rsquo; doing. It was not
beyond possibility to find yourself betrothed to a woman you had
never met before the day your mother introduced you to your
prospective bride and mother-in-law.</p>

<p>Loial seemed to think marriage would be the end of
everything for him, certainly to all his wishes to see the world,
and whether it would or not, Rand could not hand a friend over to
what he feared. He was about to say he did not know where Loial was
and suggest they return to the <em>stedding</em> until he came back&mdash;he had his mouth open to say it&mdash;when a question
occurred to him. It embarrassed him that he could not remember
something so important; to Loial, it was. &ldquo;How long has he been out
of the <em>stedding</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too long,&rdquo; Haman grumbled like boulders rolling
downhill. &ldquo;The boy never wanted to apply himself. Always talking
about seeing Outside, as if anything has really changed from
what&rsquo;s in the books he should have been studying. Um. Um. What
real change is it if humans change the lines on a map? The land is
still&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has been Outside much too long,&rdquo; Loial&rsquo;s
mother put in as firmly as a post driven into dry clay. Haman
frowned at her, and she managed to stare back at him just as firmly
although her ears vibrated in embarrassment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M-more than five years now,&rdquo; Erith said. For a
moment her ears wilted, then shot up and stubbornly back. In a very
good imitation of Covril, she said, &ldquo;I want him to be my husband. I
knew that when I first saw him. I will not let him die. Not from
being foolish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand and Loial had talked of many things, and one of
them had been the Longing, although Loial had not liked talking
about it. When the Breaking of the World drove humans to flee for
whatever safety they could find, it drove Ogier from the <em>
stedding</em> too. For long years humans had wandered in a world
that changed sometimes by the day, hunting that safety, and Ogier
had wandered, hunting for the <em>stedding</em> lost in the
changing land. It was then that the Longing entered them. An Ogier
away from the <em>stedding</em> wanted to return. An Ogier long
from the <em>stedding</em> needed to return. An Ogier too long from
the <em>stedding</em> died.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He told me of an Ogier who stayed out longer,&rdquo; Rand
said quietly. &ldquo;Ten years, I think he said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Haman was shaking his massive head before Rand
finished. &ldquo;It will not do. That I know of five have remained
Outside that long and survived to return, and I think I would know
if more had. Such madness would be written about and talked about.
Three of those died within a year of coming home, the fourth was an
invalid for the rest of his life, and the fifth little better,
needing a stick to walk. Though she did continue writing. Um. Um.
Dalar had some interesting things to say concerning&mdash;&rdquo; This
time when Covril opened her mouth, his head whipped around; he
stared at her, long eyebrows humping up, and she began smoothing
her skirts furiously. But she stared right back. &ldquo;Five years is a
short time, I know,&rdquo; Haman told Rand, while watching Covril sharply
from the corner of his eye, &ldquo;but we are tied to the <em>
stedding</em> now. We heard nothing in the city to indicate that
Loial is here&mdash;and from the excitement we ourselves caused, I
think we would have&mdash;but if you will tell us where he is, you
will be doing him a very great kindness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Two Rivers,&rdquo; Rand said. Saving a
friend&rsquo;s life was not betraying him. &ldquo;When I last saw him, he
was setting out in good company, with friends. It&rsquo;s a quiet
place, the Two Rivers. Safe.&rdquo; It was now, again, thanks to Perrin.
 &ldquo;And he was well a few months ago.&rdquo; Bode had said as much when the
girls were telling what had happened back home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Two Rivers,&rdquo; Haman muttered. &ldquo;Um. Um. Yes, I
know where that is. Another long walk.&rdquo; Ogier seldom rode, there
being few horses that could bear them, and they preferred their own
feet in any case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must start out immediately,&rdquo; Erith said in a firm
if light rumble. Light compared to Haman. Covril and Haman looked
at her in surprise, and her ears wilted completely. She was, after
all, a very young woman accompanying an Elder and a woman Rand
suspected was of some importance in her own right from the way she
stood up to Haman. Erith was probably not a day over eighty.</p>

<p>Smiling at the thought&mdash;a slip of a girl; maybe
only seventy&mdash;Rand said, &ldquo;Please accept the hospitality of
the Palace. A few days&rsquo; rest might even make your journey
faster. And you might be able to help me, Elder Haman.&rdquo; Of course;
Loial was always talking about his teacher, Elder Haman. Elder
Haman knew everything, according to Loial. &ldquo;I need to locate the
Waygates. All of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All three Ogier spoke at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Waygates?&rdquo; Haman said, ears and eyebrows both
shooting up. &ldquo;The Ways are very dangerous. Far too dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few days?&rdquo; Erith protested. &ldquo;My Loial could be
dying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few days?&rdquo; Covril said on top of her. &ldquo;My Loial
could be&mdash;&rdquo; She cut off, staring at the younger woman, lips
compressed and ears quivering.</p>

<p>Haman frowned at them both, stroking his narrow beard
irritably. &ldquo;I do not know why I let myself be talked into this. I
should be teaching my classes, and speaking to the Stump. If you
were not such a respected Speaker, Covril&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean if you were not married to my sister,&rdquo; she
said stoutly. &ldquo;Voniel told you to do your duty, Haman.&rdquo;
Haman&rsquo;s brows lowered till the long ends hung on his cheeks,
and her ears seemed to lose most of their stiffness. &ldquo;I meant to
say she <em>asked</em> you,&rdquo; she went on. Not hurriedly, exactly, not losing
aplomb, but definitely not hesitating. &ldquo;By the Tree and stillness,
I meant no offense, Elder Haman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Haman harrumphed loudly&mdash;which for an Ogier
meant very loudly&mdash;and turned to Rand, tugging his coat as if
it had been disarrayed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shadowspawn are using the Ways,&rdquo; Rand said before
Haman could speak. &ldquo;I have set guards on the few I can reach.&rdquo;
Including the one outside Stedding Tsofu, plainly after their
departure. These three could not have walked all the way from
Stedding Tsofu after his last futile visit. &ldquo;A bare handful. All of
them need to be guarded, or else Myrddraal and Trollocs can come
boiling out of nowhere, as far as anybody they catch is concerned.
But I don&rsquo;t even know where they all are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That would still leave gateways, of course. Sometimes
he wondered why one of the Forsaken did not pour a few thousand
Trollocs into the Palace by a gateway. Ten thousand, or twenty. He
would be hard pressed to stop that, if he could stop it at all. It
would be a slaughter at best. Well, he could do nothing about a
gateway unless he was there. He could do something about the
Waygates.</p>

<p>Haman exchanged looks with Covril. They drew aside,
speaking in a whisper, and for a wonder, it was low enough that all
he heard was a buzz like a huge swarm of bees on the roof. He must
be right about her having some importance. A Speaker; he had heard
the capital. He considered seizing <em>saidin</em>&mdash;he would
be able to hear, them&mdash;and rejected it disgustedly. He had
not sunk to eavesdropping yet. Erith divided her attention evenly
between her elders and Rand, all the while unconsciously smoothing
her skirts.</p>

<p>Rand hoped they did not inquire why he had not asked
his question of the Council of Elders in Stedding Tsofu. Alar,
Eldest of the Elders there, had been very firm; the Stump was
meeting, and nothing so odd&mdash;so peculiar as to never have
been thought of before&mdash;as handing control of the Waygates to
a human could be done unless the Stump concurred. Who he was hardly
seemed to matter to her any more than it did to these three.</p>

<p>Finally Haman came back frowning and gripping the
lapels of his coat. Covril was frowning too. &ldquo;This is all very
hasty, very hasty,&rdquo; Haman said in slow tones like gravel sliding.
 &ldquo;I wish I could discuss it with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, I cannot. Shadowspawn,
you say? Um. Um. Very well, if there must be haste, there must be
haste. Never let it be said that Ogier cannot move quickly when
needs require, and perhaps they do now. You must understand, The
Council of Elders in any <em>stedding</em> may tell you no, and so
may the Stump.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maps!&rdquo; Rand shouted, so loudly that all three Ogier
jumped. &ldquo;I need maps!&rdquo; He spun around looking for one of the
servants who always seemed to be about, for a <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em>, anyone. Sulin put her head into the courtyard
through a doorway. She would be nearby, after everything he had
told her. &ldquo;Maps,&rdquo; he barked at her. &ldquo;I want every map in the
Palace. And a pen, and ink. Now! Quickly!&rdquo; She looked al him almost
disparagingly&mdash;Aiel did not use maps, indeed claimed not to
need them&mdash;and turned away. &ldquo;Run, <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>!&rdquo;
he snapped. She looked over her shoulder al him&mdash;and ran. He
wished he knew how his face looked, so he could recall it for use
again.</p>

<p>Haman appeared as though he would be wringing his
hands if his dignity had been just a little smaller. &ldquo;Really, there
is very little we can possibly tell you that you don&rsquo;t already
know. Every <em>stedding</em> has one just Outside.&rdquo; The first
Waygates could not have been made inside, with the ability to
channel blocked by the <em>stedding</em> itself; even when Ogier
were given the Talisman of Growing, and could themselves make the
Ways grow to a new Waygate, the Power was still involved, if not
channeling. &ldquo;And all your cities that have Ogier groves. Though it
does seem the city here has grown <em>over</em> the grove. And in
Al&rsquo;cair&rsquo;rahienallen&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He trailed off, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>The trouble could be summed up by that name. Three
thousand years ago, near enough, there had been a city called
Al&rsquo;cair&rsquo;rahienallen, built by Ogier. Today it was
Cairhien, and the grove the Ogier builders planted to remind them
of their <em>stedding</em> was part of an estate that had belonged
to the same Barthanes whose palace now housed Rand&rsquo;s school.
Nobody but Ogier and maybe some Aes Sedai remembered
Al&rsquo;cair&rsquo;rahienallen. Not even Cairhienin.</p>

<p>Whatever Haman believed, much could change in three
thousand years. Great Ogier-built cities had ceased to exist, some
leaving not so much as a name behind. Great cities had risen that
the Ogier had had no hand in. Amador, begun after the Trolloc Wars,
was one, so Moiraine had told him, and Chachin in Kandor, and Shol
Arbela in Arafel, and Fal Moran in Shienar. In Arad Doman, Bandar
Eban had been built on the ruins of a city destroyed in the War of
the Hundred Years, a city Moiraine knew three names for, each
suspect, and itself built on the ruins of a nameless city that had
vanished in the Trolloc Wars. Rand knew of a Waygate in Shienar, in
the countryside near a moderate town that had kept part of the name
of the huge city leveled by Trollocs, and another inside the
Blight, in Shadow-murdered Malkier. Other places there had simply
been change, or growth, as Haman himself had pointed out. The
Waygate here in Caemlyn sat in a basement now. A well-guarded
basement. Rand knew there was a Waygate in Tear, out in the great
pastureland where the High Lords ran their famous horse herds.
There should be one somewhere in the Mountains of Mist, where
Manetheren had once stood, wherever that was. As far as <em>
stedding</em> went, he knew where to find Stedding Tsofu. Moiraine
had not considered <em>stedding</em> or Ogier a vital part of his
education.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know where the <em>stedding</em>
are?&rdquo; Haman said incredulously when Rand finished explaining. &ldquo;Is
this Aiel humor? I have never understood Aiel humor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Ogier,&rdquo; Rand said gently, &ldquo;it has been a long
time since the Ways were made. For humans, it has been a very long
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you do not even <em>remember</em> Mafal
Dadaranell, or Ancohima, or Londaren Cor, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Covril put a hand on Haman&rsquo;s shoulder, but the
pity in her eyes was directed at Rand. &ldquo;He does not remember,&rdquo; she
said softly. &ldquo;Their memories are gone.&rdquo; She made it sound the
greatest loss imaginable. Erith, hands clasped to her mouth,
appeared ready to cry.</p>

<p>Sulin returned, quite deliberately not running,
followed by a fat cluster of <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, their arms
filled to overflowing with rolled maps of all sizes, some long
enough to drag on the courtyard paving stones. One white-robed man
carried an ivory-inlaid writing box. &ldquo;I have set <em>
gai&rsquo;shain</em> looking for more,&rdquo; she said stiffly, &ldquo;and some
of the wetlanders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he told her. A little of the tautness
went from her face.</p>

<p>Squatting down, he began spreading maps right there
on the paving stones, sorting them. A number were of the city, and
many of parts of Andor. He quickly found one showing the whole
stretch of the Borderlands, and the Light knew what that was doing
in Caemlyn. Some were old and tattered, showing borders that no
longer applied, naming countries that had faded away hundreds of
years before.</p>

<p>Borders and names were enough to rank the maps by
age. On the oldest, Hardan bordered Cairhien to the north; then
Hardan was gone and Cairhien&rsquo;s borders swept halfway to
Shienar before creeping back as it became clear the Sun Throne
simply could not hold on to that much land. Maredo stood between
Tear and Illian, then Maredo was gone, and Tear and Illian&rsquo;s
borders met on the Plains of Maredo, slowly falling back for the
same reasons as Cairhien&rsquo;s. Caralain vanished, and Almoth,
Mosara and Irenvelle, and others, sometimes absorbed by other
nations, most often eventually becoming unclaimed land and
wilderness. Those maps told a story of fading since Hawkwing&rsquo;s
empire crumbled, of humanity in slow retreat. A second Borderland
map showed only Saldaea and part of Arafel, but it showed the
Blightborder fifty miles farther north too. Humanity retreated, and
the Shadow advanced.</p>

<p>A bald, skinny man in ill-fitting Palace livery
scurried into the courtyard with another armload, and Rand sighed
and went on selecting and discarding.</p>

<p>Haman gravely examined the writing box that was held
out to him by the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>, then produced one almost
as large, though quite plain, from a capacious coat pocket. The pen
he took from it was polished wood, rather fatter than Rand&rsquo;s
thumb and long enough to look slender. It fit the Ogier&rsquo;s
sausage-thick fingers perfectly. He got down on hands and knees,
crawling among the maps as Rand sorted, occasionally dipping his
pen in the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>&rsquo;s inkpot, annotating in a
handwriting that seemed too large until you realized that for him
it was very small. Covril followed, peering over his shoulder even
after he asked the second time whether she really thought he would
make a mistake.</p>

<p>It was an education for Rand, beginning with seven
<em>stedding</em> scattered through the Borderlands. But then,
Trollocs feared to enter a <em>stedding</em>, and even Myrddraal
needed some great purpose to drive them into one. The Spine of the
World, the Dragonwall, held thirteen, including one in
Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger, from Stedding Shangtai in the south to
Stedding Qichen and Stedding Sanshen in the north, only a few miles
apart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The land truly changed in the Breaking of the
World,&rdquo; Haman explained when Rand commented. He continued marking
briskly, though; briskly for an Ogier. &ldquo;Dry land became sea and sea
dry land, but the land folded as well. Sometimes what was far apart
became close together, and what was close, far. Though of course,
no one can say whether Qichen and Sanshen were far apart at
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forgot Cantoine,&rdquo; Covril announced, making
another liveried servant drop his fresh armload of maps with a
start.</p>

<p>Haman gave her a look and lettered in the name just
above the River Iralell, not far north of Haddon Mirk. In the strip
west of the Dragonwall from the southern border of Shienar to the
Sea of Storms, there were only four, all newfound as the Ogier
considered it, meaning the youngest, Tsofu, had had Ogier back for
six hundred years and none of the others for more than a thousand.
Some of the locations were as big a surprise as the Borderlands,
such as the Mountains of Mist, which had six, and the Shadow Coast.
The Black Hills were included, and the forests above the River Ivo,
and the mountains above the River Dhagon, just north of Arad
Doman.</p>

<p>Sadder was the list of <em>stedding</em> abandoned,
given up because the numbers there had grown too few. The Spine of
the World and the Mountains of Mist and the Shadow Coast were in
that list too, and so was a <em>stedding</em> deep on Almoth Plain,
near the great forest called the Paerish Swar, and one in the low
mountains along the north of Toman Head, facing the Aryth Ocean.
Perhaps saddest was the one marked on the very edge of the Blight
in Arafel; Myrddraal might be reluctant to enter a <em>
stedding</em>, but as the Blight marched south year by year, it
swept over everything.</p>

<p>Pausing, Haman said sadly, &ldquo;Sherandu was swallowed by
The Great Blight one thousand eight hundred forty-three years ago,
and Chandar nine hundred sixty-eight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May their memories flourish and flower in the
Light,&rdquo; Covril and Erith murmured together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know of one you didn&rsquo;t mark,&rdquo; Rand said.
Perrin had told him of sheltering in it once. He pulled out a map
of Andor east of the River Arinelle and touched a spot well above
the road from Caemlyn to Whitebridge. It was close enough.</p>

<p>Haman grimaced, almost a snarl. &ldquo;Where
Hawkwing&rsquo;s city was to be. That was never reclaimed. Several
<em>stedding</em> were found and never reclaimed. We try to stay
away from the lands of men as much as possible.&rdquo; All of the marks
were in rugged mountains, in places men found hard to enter, or in
a few cases just far from any human habitation. Stedding Tsofu lay
far closer than any other to where humans dwelled, and even then
Rand knew it was a full day to the nearest village.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This would be a fine discussion another time,&rdquo;
Covril said, directing her words to Rand yet plainly meaning them
for Haman, as her sidelong looks indicated, &ldquo;but I want to make as
far west as I can before nightfall.&rdquo; Haman sighed heavily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you&rsquo;ll stay here awhile,&rdquo; Rand
protested. &ldquo;You must be exhausted, walking all the way from
Cairhien.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women do not become exhausted,&rdquo; Haman said, &ldquo;they
only exhaust others. That is a very old saying among us.&rdquo; Covril
and Erith sniffed in harmony. Muttering to himself, Haman went on
with his listing, but now it was cities that the Ogier had built,
cities where the groves had been, each grove holding its Waygate to
carry Ogier back and forth to the <em>stedding</em> without passing
through the so-often troubled lands of men.</p>

<p>Caemlyn he marked, of course, and Tar Valon, Tear and
Illian, Cairhien and Maradon and Ebou Dar. That was the end as far
as cities that still existed were concerned, and Ebou Dar he wrote
as Barashta. Perhaps Barashta belonged with the others, in a way,
with the dots made in places where the maps showed nothing but a
village if that. Mafal Dadaranell, Ancohima, and Londaren Cor, of
course, and Manetheren. Aren Mador, Aridhol, Shaemal, Deranbar,
Braem, Condaris, Hai Ecorimon, Iman&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;as that list grew, Rand
began to see damp spots on each map when Haman was done. It took
him a moment to realize that the Ogier Elder was weeping silently,
letting the tears fall as he marked cities dead and forgotten.
Perhaps he wept for the people, perhaps for the memories. The one
thing Rand could be sure of was that it was not for the cities
themselves, not for the lost works of Ogier masons. To the Ogier,
stonework was only something they had picked up during the Exile,
and what work in stone could compare with the majesty of trees?</p>

<p>One of those names more than tugged at Rand&rsquo;s
memories, and its location as well, east of Baerlon, several days
above Whitebridge on the Arinelle. &ldquo;There was a grove here?&rdquo; he
said, fingering the mark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Aridhol?&rdquo; Haman said. &ldquo;Yes. Yes, there was. A sad
business, that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand did not raise his head. &ldquo;In Shadar Logoth,&rdquo; he
corrected. &ldquo;A very sad business. Could you&mdash;would you&mdash;show me that Waygate if I took you there?&rdquo;</p>
