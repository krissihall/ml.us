<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">W</span>alking
back out to the great sprawl of tents, Egwene
tried to get a grip on herself, but she was not sure her feet
actually touched the ground. Well, she knew they did. They added
their small portion to the waves of dust swept along by the hot
gusting wind; coughing, she wished Wise Ones wore veils. A shawl
wrapped around your head was not the same, and it was like wearing
a sweat tent besides. Yet she felt as if her feet trod on air. Her
brain seemed to be spinning, and not from the heat.</p>

<p>At first she had thought Gawyn was not going to meet
her, but then he was suddenly just there as she walked through the
crowds. They had spent the entire morning in the private dining
room of The Long Man, holding hands and talking over tea. She was
absolutely brazen, kissing him as soon as the door closed, before
he so much as made a move to kiss her, even sitting on his knee
once, though that had not lasted long. It made her start thinking
of his dreams, about maybe slipping back into them again, about
things no decent woman should be thinking at all! Not an unmarried
woman, anyway. She had bounded up like a startled doe, startling
him in turn.</p>

<p>Hastily she looked around. The tents were still half
a mile off, and there was not a living soul closer. If there had
been, they could not have seen her blushes. Realizing she was
grinning idiotically behind the shawl, she wiped it away. Light,
she had to keep a rein on herself. Forget the feel of Gawyn&rsquo;s
strong arms and remember why they had had so much time at The Long
Man.</p>

<p><em>Threading through the crowd, she peered about,
looking for Gawyn and trying with some difficulty to pretend
casualness; she did not want him to think her eager, after all.
Suddenly a man leaned toward her, whispering fiercely. &ldquo;Follow me
to The Long Man.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>She jumped; she could not help herself. It took
her a moment to recognize Gawyn. He wore a plain brown coat, and a
thin dustcloak hung down his back, the hood up and nearly hiding
his face. He was not the only one cloaked&mdash;any but Aiel who
went beyond the city walls wore one&mdash;but not many had their
hoods raised in that oven heat.</em></p>

<p><em>She caught his sleeve firmly as he tried to slide
away ahead of her. &ldquo;What makes you think I&rsquo;ll just go off to
an inn with you, Gawyn Trakand?&rdquo; she demanded, eyes narrowing. She
did keep her voice down, though; no need to attract eyes to an
argument. &ldquo;We were going to walk. You are taking entirely too much
for granted if you think for a moment&mdash;</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Grimacing, he whispered at her hurriedly. &ldquo;The
women I came with are looking for someone. Someone like you. They
say little in front of me, but I&rsquo;ve caught a word here and
there. Now follow me.&rdquo; Without a backward glance he strode off down
the street, leaving her to follow with a lurching stomach.</em></p>

<p>The memory settled her feet firmly. The burned-over
ground was nearly as hot as the city paving stones through the
soles of her soft boots. She trudged through the dust, thinking
furiously. Gawyn had not known much more than he told in that first
exchange. He argued that it could not be her they were looking for,
that she just had to be careful of her channeling and stay out of
sight as much as possible. Only, he had not looked very convinced
himself, not wearing a disguise. She refrained from mentioning his
clothes; he was so worried that if these Aes Sedai found her she
would be in all sorts of troubles, worried that he would lead them
to her, so plainly unwilling to stop seeing her even if he did
suggest it himself. And so convinced that what she needed was to
sneak somehow back to Tar Valon and into the Tower. That, or to
make her peace with Coiren and the others and return with them.
Light, but she should have been angry at him, thinking he knew what
was best for her better than she did, but for some reason it made
her want to smile indulgently even now. For some reason she just
could not think straight about him, and he seemed to creep into
whatever thought she had.</p>

<p>Chewing her lip, she focused on the real problem. The
Tower Aes Sedai. If only she could bring herself to question Gawyn;
it would not be betraying him to ask just a few small questions,
their Ajahs, where they went, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;no! She had made that
promise to herself, but breaking it would dishonor him. No
questions. Only what he volunteered.</p>

<p>Whatever he said, she had no reason to think they
were looking for Egwene al&rsquo;Vere. And, she admitted
reluctantly, no real reason to think they were not, only a lot of
suppositions and hopes. Just because a Tower agent would not
recognize Egwene al&rsquo;Vere in an Aiel woman did not say that the
agent had not heard the name, even heard of Egwene Sedai of the
Green Ajah. She winced. From now on, she would have to be very
careful in the city. More than careful.</p>

<p>She had reached the edge of the tents. The encampment
sprawled over miles, covering the hills east of the city whether
treed or not. Aiel moved among the low tents, but only a handful of
<em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> nearby. None of the Wise Ones were in
sight. She had broken a promise to them. To Amys, really, but to
all of them. Necessity seemed an increasingly thin reed to support
her deception.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Join us, Egwene,&rdquo; a woman&rsquo;s voice called. Even
with her head covered, Egwene was not hard to pick out unless
surrounded by girls not yet full grown. Surandha, Sorilea&rsquo;s
apprentice, had poked her dark golden head out of a tent and was
waving to her. &ldquo;The Wise Ones are meeting back among the tents, all
of them, and they&rsquo;ve given us all the day for ourselves. The
entire day.&rdquo; That was a luxury seldom offered, and not one Egwene
would pass up.</p>

<p>Inside, women lay sprawled on cushions reading by oil
lamps&mdash;the tent was closed against dust, and thus against
light as well&mdash;or sat sewing or knitting or doing embroidery.
Two were playing cat&rsquo;s cradle. A low murmur of conversation
filled the tent, and several smiled greetings. They were not all
apprentices&mdash;two mothers and several first-sisters had come
to visit&mdash;and the older women wore as much jewelry as any
Wise One. Everyone had their blouses half-unlaced and shawls
wrapped around their waists, though the trapped heat did not seem
to bother them.</p>

<p>A <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> moved about refilling
teacups. Something in the way he moved said he was a craftsman, not
<em>algai&rsquo;d&rsquo;siswai</em>; he was still hard of face, yet a
trifle softer by comparison, and maintaining a meek manner seemed
less of a struggle. He wore one of those headbands naming him
<em>siswai&rsquo;aman</em>. None of the women gave it a second
glance, though <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> were not supposed to wear
anything but white.</p>

<p>Egwene tied her shawl around her waist and gratefully
accepted water to wash her face and hands, then undid a few of her
blouse laces and took a tasseled red cushion between Surandha and
Estair, Aeron&rsquo;s red-haired apprentice. &ldquo;What are the Wise Ones
meeting about?&rdquo; Her mind was not on the Wise Ones. She had no
intention of avoiding the city entirely&mdash;she had agreed to
look in at The Long Man every morning to see whether Gawyn was
there, though the smirk on the stout innkeeper&rsquo;s face made her
cheeks grow warm; the Light only knew what that woman thought!&mdash;but there definitely would be no more attempts to listen in
at Lady Arilyn&rsquo;s mansion. After leaving Gawyn she had gone
near enough to sense the channeling continuing inside, but left
after one quick peek around the corner. Just standing that close
produced the uneasy feeling that Nesune was going to pop up behind
her. &ldquo;Does anyone know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your sisters, of course,&rdquo; Surandha laughed. She was
a handsome woman, with large blue eyes, and laughter made her
beautiful. Some five years older than Egwene, she could channel as
strongly as many Aes Sedai and was eagerly awaiting the call to a
hold of her own. In the meanwhile, of course, she jumped when
Sorilea <em>thought</em> jump. &ldquo;What else would make them leap as
if they had sat on <em>segade</em> spines?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should send Sorilea to talk with them,&rdquo; Egwene
said, taking a green-striped cup of tea from the
<em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>. While telling her how his Younglings were
crowded into all the bedrooms not taken by the Aes Sedai, and some
into the stables, Gawyn had let slip that there was no room for
even another scullery maid, and that the Aes Sedai were not
preparing any. It was good news. &ldquo;Sorilea could make any number of
Aes Sedai sit up straight.&rdquo; Surandha&rsquo;s head went back in gales
of laughter.</p>

<p>Estair&rsquo;s laugh was faint, and more than a touch
scandalized. A slender young woman with serious gray eyes, she
always behaved as if a Wise One was watching her. It never ceased
to amaze Egwene that Sorilea should have an apprentice who was full
of fun, while Aeron, pleasant and smiling, with never a cross word,
had one who seemed to hunt for rules to obey. &ldquo;I believe it is the
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>,&rdquo; Estair said in the gravest of
tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Egwene asked absently. She was just going to
have to avoid the city. Except for Gawyn, of course; embarrassing
as it might be to admit, she would not forgo meeting him for
anything less than the certainty of Nesune waiting in The Long Man.
That meant back to walking around the city walls for exercise, in
all that dust. This morning had been an exception, but she was not
going to give the Wise Ones any excuse to put off her return to
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. Tonight they would meet the
Salidar Aes Sedai alone, but in seven nights, she would be with
them. &ldquo;What now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not heard?&rdquo; Surandha exclaimed.</p>

<p>In two or three days she could approach Nynaeve and
Elayne, or speak to them in their dreams again. Try to speak to
them, anyway; you could never be absolutely certain the other
person knew you were more than a dream, not unless they were used
to communicating that way, which Nynaeve and Elayne certainly were
not. She had only spoken to them that way once before. In any case,
the thought of approaching them at all still made her vaguely
uneasy. She had had another hazy almost nightmare about it; every
time one of them said a word, they tripped and fell on their faces
or dropped a cup or plate or knocked over a vase, always something
that shattered on impact. Since interpreting the dream about Gawyn
becoming her Warder she had been making an effort at all of them.
To no real effect so far, but she was sure that one had meaning.
Maybe it was best to wait on the next meeting to speak to them.
Besides, there was always the chance of running into Gawyn&rsquo;s
dreams again, being drawn in. Just the thought made her cheeks
color.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> has returned,&rdquo;
Estair said. &ldquo;He is to meet your sisters this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All thoughts of Gawyn and dreams gone, Egwene frowned
into her teacup. Twice inside ten days. It was unusual for him to
come back so soon. Why had he? Had he learned of the Tower Aes
Sedai somehow? How? And as always, his trips themselves triggered
their own question. <em>How</em> did he do it?</p>

<p>&ldquo;How does he do what?&rdquo; Estair asked, and Egwene
blinked, startled that she had spoken aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How does he upset my stomach so easily?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surandha shook her head in commiseration, but she
grinned too. &ldquo;He is a man, Egwene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>,&rdquo; Estair
said with heavy emphasis, and more than a touch of reverence.
Egwene would not be entirely surprised to see her wind that fool
strip of cloth around her head.</p>

<p>Surandha immediately tackled Estair over how she was
ever going to deal with a hold chief, much less a sept or clan
chief, if she did not realize that a man did not stop being a man
just because he led, while Estair maintained stoutly that the
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em> was different. One of the older
women, Mera, who had come to see her daughter, leaned toward them
and said that the way to handle any chief&mdash;hold, sept, clan
<em>or</em> the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>&mdash;was the same
as the way to handle a husband, which brought a laugh from Baerin,
also there to visit a daughter, and a comment that that would be a
good way to have a roofmistress lay her knife at your feet, a
declaration of feud. Baerin had been a Maiden before she married,
but anyone could declare a feud with anyone other than a Wise One
or a blacksmith. Before the words were well out of Mera&rsquo;s
mouth everybody except the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em> joined in,
overwhelming poor Estair&mdash;the <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>
was a chief among chiefs, no more; that was certain&mdash;but
arguing whether it was better to approach a chief directly or
through his roofmistress.</p>

<p>Egwene paid little attention. Surely Rand would not
do anything foolish. He had been properly doubtful concerning
Elaida&rsquo;s letter, yet he believed Alviarin&rsquo;s, which was
not only more cordial, but downright fawning. He thought he had
friends, even followers, in the Tower. She did not. Three Oaths or
no Three Oaths, she was convinced Elaida and Alviarin had worked up
that second letter between them, with all its ridiculous talk of
 &ldquo;kneeling in his radiance.&rdquo; It was all a ploy to get him into the
Tower.</p>

<p>Looking at her hands regretfully, she sighed and set
down her cup. It was snatched up by the <em>gai&rsquo;shain</em>
before her hand was well away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; she told the two apprentices.
 &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something I realize I have to do.&rdquo; Surandha and
Estair made noises about going with her&mdash;well, more than
noises; if Aiel said something, they meant it&mdash;but they were
caught up in the discussion and did not argue when she insisted
they stay. Wrapping her shawl around her head again and leaving the
rising voices behind&mdash;Mera was telling Estair in no uncertain
tones that she might be a Wise One eventually, but until she was
she could listen to a woman who had managed a husband and raised
three daughters and two sons without a sister-wife to help&mdash;Egwene ducked back into the windblown dust.</p>

<p>In the city, she tried to creep through the crowded
streets without appearing to creep, tried to look every way while
seeming to watch only where she was going. The chances of walking
into Nesune were small, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ahead of her two women in sober
dresses and prim aprons sidestepped to go around one another, but
both moved the same way, and they came nose to nose. Murmured
apologies, and each woman stepped aside again. In the same
direction. More apologies, and as if dancing, they moved together
once more. As Egwene passed them, they were still stepping from
side to side in perfect unison, faces beginning to redden,
apologies swallowed behind compressed lips. How long it might go on
she had no idea, but it was well to remember that Rand was in the
city. Light, when he was around, it would not be beyond belief for
her to walk right up on all six Aes Sedai just as a gust of wind
ripped the shawl from around her head and three people shouted her
name and called her Aes Sedai. With him around, it would not be
entirely beyond belief to walk into Elaida.</p>

<p>She hurried on, increasingly uneasy about being
caught in one of his <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> swirls, increasingly
wild-eyed. Fortunately, the sight of a wild-eyed Aiel with her face
hidden&mdash;what did they know of the difference between a shawl
and a veil?&mdash;made people move out of her way, which allowed
her to speed along at a near trot, but she did not draw a peaceful
breath until she slipped into the Sun Palace by a small
servant&rsquo;s door in the rear.</p>

<p>A strong smell of cooking hung in the narrow hallway,
and liveried men and women scurried back and forth. Others, taking
their ease in their shirtsleeves or flapping aprons to make a
little breeze, stared at her in astonishment. Likely no one except
other servants came this close to the kitchens from one year to the
next. Certainly not an Aiel. They looked as though they expected
her to produce a spear from under her skirts.</p>

<p>She pointed a finger at a round little man who was
wiping his neck with a kerchief. &ldquo;Do you know where Rand
al&rsquo;Thor is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave a start, rolling his eyes toward his
companions, who were quickly drifting away. His feet shifted,
wanting very much to follow. &ldquo;The Lord Dragon, uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;mistress?
In his chambers? I suppose, anyway.&rdquo; He began to shuffle sideways,
bowing. &ldquo;If Mistress&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;if my Lady will forgive, I must
get back to my&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will take me there.&rdquo; she said firmly. She was
not going to wander about this time.</p>

<p>One last eye-rolling after his vanished friends, a
sigh quickly suppressed, a hurried frightened look to see whether
he had offended, and he scampered off to fetch his coat. He was
very efficient in the warren of palace corridors, hurrying along
and bowing her way at every turn, but when at last he pointed with
yet another bow to tall doors worked with gilded rising suns and
guarded by a Maiden and an Aielman, she felt a flash of contempt as
she dismissed him. She could not understand why; he was simply
doing what he was paid to do.</p>

<p>The Aielman stood as she approached, a <em>very</em>
tall man in his middle years, with bull-like chest and shoulders
and cold gray eyes. Egwene did not know him, and he plainly meant
to turn her away. Luckily she did know the Maiden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her pass, Maric,&rdquo; Somara said, grinning. &ldquo;This
is Amys&rsquo; apprentice, hers and Bair&rsquo;s and Melaine&rsquo;s,
the only apprentice I know to serve three Wise Ones. And from the
look of her, they have sent her running with strong words for Rand
al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Running?&rdquo; Maric&rsquo;s chuckle softened neither face
nor eyes. &ldquo;Crawling, it looks.&rdquo; He went back to watching the
corridor.</p>

<p>Egwene did not have to ask what he meant. Digging her
handkerchief out of her belt pouch, she wiped hurriedly at her
face; no one could take you seriously dirty, and Rand had to
listen. &ldquo;Important words anyway, Somara. He is alone, I hope. The
Aes Sedai haven&rsquo;t come yet?&rdquo; The handkerchief came away gray
and went back into her pouch with a sigh.</p>

<p>Somara shook her head. &ldquo;It is some good time before
they are due. Will you tell him to be careful? I mean no disrespect
to your sisters, but he will not look where he leaps. He is
headstrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell him.&rdquo; Egwene could not help a grin. She
had heard Somara talk this way before&mdash;with the sort of
exasperated pride a mother might have for an over-adventurous son
of about ten&mdash;and a few other Maidens as well. It had to be
some sort of Aiel joke, and even if she did not understand, she was
in favor of anything that kept him from getting too big a head.
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him to wash his ears, too.&rdquo; Somara actually nodded
before catching herself. Egwene drew a deep breath. &ldquo;Somara, my
sisters mustn&rsquo;t find out I am here.&rdquo; Maric glanced at her
curiously, between studying every servant who entered the hallway.
She had to be careful. &ldquo;We are not close, Somara. In fact, you
might say we are as far apart as sisters can be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The worst bad blood is between first-sisters,&rdquo;
Somara said with a nod. &ldquo;Go in. They will not hear your name from
me, and if Maric&rsquo;s tongue flaps, I will tie a knot in it.&rdquo;
Maric, head and shoulders taller and weighing at least twice as
much, smiled slightly without looking at her.</p>

<p>The Maidens&rsquo; habit of sending her in without
announcing her had led to embarrassments in the past, but this time
Rand was not sitting in his bath. The apartments had obviously
belonged to the king, and the anteroom was more a throne room in
miniature. Miniature by comparison with the real throne room,
anyway. The wavy rays of a golden sun a full span across, set in
the polished stone floor, were the only curves in sight. Tall
mirrors in severe gold frames lined the walls beneath broad
straight bands of gilding, and the deep cornice was made of golden
triangles overlapping like scales. Heavily gilded chairs to either
side of the rising sun made two facing lines as stiff as their tall
backs. Rand sat in another chair, with twice the gilding and a back
twice as high, atop a small dais that was itself encrusted with
gilt. In a red silk coat embroidered in gold and holding that piece
of carved Seanchan spear in the crook of his arm, he wore a dark
scowl. He looked a king, and one about to do murder.</p>

<p>She planted her fists on her hips. &ldquo;Somara says you
should wash your ears right this instant, young man,&rdquo; she said, and
his head jerked up.</p>

<p>Surprise, and a touch of outrage, lasted only a
moment. With a grin he stepped down and tossed the spearhead onto
the chair seat. &ldquo;What under the Light have you been doing?&rdquo;
Striding the length of the chamber, he took her by the shoulders
and turned her to face the nearest mirror.</p>

<p>She winced in spite of herself. She was a sight. The
dust that had sifted through her shawl&mdash;no; mud, with the
sweat added&mdash;made streaks across her cheeks and swirls across
her forehead where she had tried to scrub it away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have Somara send for some water,&rdquo; he said
dryly. &ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;ll think it is for my ears.&rdquo; That grin was
insufferable!</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no need,&rdquo; she told him with as much dignity
as she could muster. She was not about to have him stand there
watching her wash. Pulling out her already grimy handkerchief, she
hurriedly tried to clean off the worst. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re meeting Coiren
and the others soon. I don&rsquo;t have to warn you they&rsquo;re
dangerous, do I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you just did. They aren&rsquo;t all coming. I
said no more than three, so that is what they&rsquo;re sending.&rdquo; In
the mirror his head tilted as if he were listening, and he nodded,
voice dropping to a murmur. &ldquo;Yes, I can handle three, if they
aren&rsquo;t too strong.&rdquo; Abruptly he noticed her looking. &ldquo;Of
course, if one of them is Moghedien in a wig, or Semirhage, I may
be in trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand, you must take this seriously.&rdquo; The
handkerchief was not doing much good. With the greatest reluctance,
she spat on it; there was simply no dignified way to spit on a
handkerchief. &ldquo;I know how strong you are, but they are Aes Sedai.
You can&rsquo;t behave like they&rsquo;re women in from the country.
Even if you think Alviarin <em>will</em> kneel at your feet, and
all her friends with her, these were sent by Elaida. You can&rsquo;t
think she means anything but to try putting a leash on you. The
short and simple of it is, you should send them away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And trust your hidden friends?&rdquo; he asked softly.
Much too softly.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done with her face; she
should have let him send for the water. There was no asking for it
now, though, not after refusing. &ldquo;You know you cannot trust
Elaida,&rdquo; she said carefully, turning to him. Mindful of what had
happened the last time, she did not even want to mention the Aes
Sedai in Salidar. &ldquo;You know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust any Aes Sedai. They&rdquo;&mdash;there
was a hesitation in his voice, as if he had started to use another
word, though she could not imagine what&mdash;&ldquo;will try to use me,
and I will try to use them. A pretty circle, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;
If she had ever considered the possibility that he could be allowed
near the Salidar Aes Sedai, his eyes disabused her of it, so hard,
so cold, that she shivered inside.</p>

<p>Maybe if he got angry enough, if he struck enough
sparks with Coiren that the embassy went back to the Tower
empty-handed, on their own&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;If you think it is pretty, I
suppose it is; you are the Dragon Reborn. Well, since you intend to
go through with this, you might as well do it right. Just remember
that they are Aes Sedai. Even a king listens to Aes Sedai with
respect, even when he doesn&rsquo;t agree, and he&rsquo;d set out for
Tar Valon on the hour if summoned. Even the Tairen High Lords
would, or Pedron Niall.&rdquo; The fool man grinned at her again, or at
least showed his teeth; the rest of his face was as blank as river
rock. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re paying attention. I am trying to help
you.&rdquo; Just not the way he thought. &ldquo;If you mean to use them, you
can&rsquo;t make them bristle like doused cats. The Dragon Reborn
won&rsquo;t impress them any more than he does me, with your fancy
coats and your thrones and your fool scepter.&rdquo; She shot a scornful
look at the tasseled spearhead; Light, the thing made her skin
crawl! &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t going to fall on their knees when they see
you, and it won&rsquo;t kill you when they don&rsquo;t. It will not
kill you to be courteous, either. Bend your stubborn neck. It
isn&rsquo;t groveling to show a proper deference, a little
humbleness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Proper deference,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully. With a
sigh, he shook his head ruefully, scrubbed a hand through his hair.
 &ldquo;I suppose I can&rsquo;t talk to an Aes Sedai the same way I do to
some lord who&rsquo;s been plotting behind my back. It&rsquo;s good
advice, Egwene. I&rsquo;ll try. I will be humble as a mouse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trying not to look hurried, she rubbed at her face
again with the handkerchief to hide her goggling. She was not
really sure her eyes were popping, but she thought they must be.
Her whole life, any time she pointed out that right was a better
way, he stuck out his chin and insisted on left! Why did he have to
choose now to listen?</p>

<p>Was there anything to the good as matters stood? At
least it could not hurt him to display some respect. Even if they
followed Elaida, the idea of anyone showing impertinence to any Aes
Sedai really did upset her. Only she <em>wanted</em> him to be
impertinent, to be as arrogant as he had ever been. There was no
point in trying to undo it, not now; he was not slow-witted. Only
exasperating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that all you came for?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>She could not go yet. There might be a chance to put
things right, or at least make sure he was not wool-headed enough
to go to Tar Valon. &ldquo;Do you know there&rsquo;s a Sea Folk
Wavemistress on a ship in the river? The <em>White Spray</em>.&rdquo;
That was as good a change of topic as any. &ldquo;She came to see you,
and I hear she is growing impatient.&rdquo; That was from Gawyn. Erian
had had herself rowed out to discover what Sea Folk were doing so
far inland, and was refused permission to board. She had come back
in a mood that would have been called a tail-lashing fury in any
woman not Aes Sedai. Egwene more than suspected why they were here,
but she was not about to tell Rand; for once let him meet somebody
without expecting them to bow down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Atha&rsquo;an Miere are everywhere, it seems.&rdquo;
Rand took a seat in one of the chairs; he looked amused for some
reason, but she would swear it had nothing to do with the Sea Folk.
 &ldquo;Berelain says I should meet this Harine din Togara Two Winds, but
if her temper is anything like Berelain reports, she can wait. I
have enough women angry with me for the moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was almost an opening, but not quite. &ldquo;I cannot
understand why. You always have such a winning way about you.&rdquo;
Immediately she wished she had the words back; they only reinforced
what she did <em>not</em> want him to do.</p>

<p>Frowning, he seemed not to have heard her at all.
 &ldquo;Egwene, I know you don&rsquo;t like Berelain, but it hasn&rsquo;t
gone beyond that, has it? I mean, you make such a good job of
playing at Aiel, I could imagine you offering to dance the spears
with her. She was troubled about something, uneasy, but she
wouldn&rsquo;t say what.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Probably the woman had found a man who told her no;
that would be enough to shake Berelain&rsquo;s world to its
foundations. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not said a dozen words to her since the
Stone of Tear, and not many more then. Rand, you don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the doors opened just barely enough to admit
Somara, who shut it again behind her quickly. &ldquo;The Aes Sedai are
here, <em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s head swiveled toward the door, his face
stone. &ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t to come for another&mdash;! Thinking to
catch me off guard, were they? They have to learn who sets the
rules here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Right then Egwene did not care if they were trying to
catch him in his smallclothes. All thought of Berelain vanished.
Somara made a small gesture that might have been commiseration. She
did not care about that either. Rand could keep them from taking
her, if she asked. All it meant was staying close to him from now
on so they could not shield her and hustle her away the first time
she put her nose into the street. All it meant was asking, putting
herself under his protection. The choice between that and being
hauled back to the Tower in a sack was so thin it made her stomach
hurt. For one thing, she would never become Aes Sedai hiding behind
him, and for another, the idea of hiding behind anyone set her
teeth on edge. Only, they were here, right outside the door, and
inside the hour she might be in that sack, or as good as. Deep slow
breaths did nothing to steady her twitching nerves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand, is there another way out of here? If there
isn&rsquo;t, I will hide in one of the other rooms. They
mustn&rsquo;t know I am here. Rand? Rand! Are you listening to
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke, but definitely not to her. &ldquo;You
<em>are</em> there,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely. &ldquo;Too much coincidence
for you to think of that now.&rdquo; He was staring at nothing with a
look of fury, and maybe fear. &ldquo;Burn you, answer me! I know
you&rsquo;re there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene licked her lips before she could stop herself.
Somara might be gazing at him with what could be described as fond
motherly concern&mdash;and him not even noticing her joke&mdash;but Egwene&rsquo;s stomach was turning over slowly. He could not
have gone mad as suddenly as that. He could not have. But he had
seemed to listen to some hidden voice just a little while ago, and
maybe spoken to it then too.</p>

<p>She did not remember crossing the intervening space,
but abruptly her hand was pressed against his forehead. Nynaeve
always said to check for fever first, though what good that would
do now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;if only she knew more than a scrap of Healing. But
that would do no good, either. Not if he was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;Rand, are you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Are you feeling all right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came to himself, shying back from her hand,
peering at her suspiciously. The next moment he was on his feet,
gripping her arm, all but hauling her down the chamber so quickly
she nearly tripped over her skirts trying to keep up. &ldquo;Stand right
there,&rdquo; he ordered briskly, planting her beside the dais, and
backed away.</p>

<p>Rubbing her arm vigorously enough that he could not
miss it, she started to follow. Men never realized how strong they
were; even Gawyn did not always, though she did not really mind
with him. &ldquo;What do you think&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move!&rdquo; In a disgusted tone he added,
 &ldquo;Burn him, it seems it ripples if you move. I&rsquo;ll fasten it to
the floor, but you still can&rsquo;t jump about. I don&rsquo;t know
how big I can make it, and this is no time to find out.&rdquo;
Somara&rsquo;s mouth had fallen open, though she snapped it shut
quickly.</p>

<p>Fasten what to the floor? What was he talking&mdash;?
It came to her so suddenly that she forgot to wonder who the &ldquo;him&rdquo;
was. Rand had woven <em>saidin</em> around her. Her eyes widened;
she was breathing too quickly, but she could not stop. How close
was it? Every shred of reason told her the taint could not seep out
of whatever he channeled; he had touched her with <em>saidin</em>
before, but if anything, that thought only made it worse.
Instinctively she narrowed her shoulders and held her skirts close
in front of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;? What did you do?&rdquo; She was very proud of
her voice, a trifle unsteady maybe, but nothing like the wail she
wanted to let out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look in that mirror,&rdquo; he laughed. Laughed!</p>

<p>Grumpily she obeyed&mdash;and gasped. There in the
silvered glass was the gilded chair on its dais. Some of the rest
of the room. But not her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;invisible,&rdquo; she breathed.
Once Moiraine had hidden them all behind a screen of
<em>saidar</em>, but how had he learned it?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much better than hiding under my bed,&rdquo; he said,
speaking to air a good hand to the right of her head. As if
<em>that</em> had ever entered her mind! &ldquo;I want you to see how
respectful I can be. Besides,&rdquo; his tone became more serious, &ldquo;maybe
you&rsquo;ll see something I miss. Maybe you&rsquo;ll even be willing
to tell me.&rdquo; With a bark of a laugh he leaped onto the dais,
scooped up the tasseled spearhead and took his seat. &ldquo;Send them in,
Somara. Let the embassy of the White Tower approach the Dragon
Reborn.&rdquo; His twisted smile made Egwene almost as uncomfortable as
the nearness of woven <em>saidin</em>. How close was the bloody
stuff?</p>

<p>Somara vanished, and in moments the doors opened
wide.</p>

<p>A plump, stately woman who could only be Coiren led
the way in a dark blue gown, flanked a pace to the rear by Nesune
in plain brown wool and a raven-haired Aes Sedai in green silk, a
pretty, round-faced woman with a plump, demanding mouth. Egwene
wished Aes Sedai always wore the colors of their Ajah&mdash;Whites
did at every chance&mdash;because whatever that woman was, she
would not believe her Green, not with the hard stare she gave Rand
from her first step into the room. Cold serenity barely masked her
contempt, perhaps did mask it for anyone not used to Aes Sedai.
Would Rand see? Maybe not; he seemed to be concentrating on Coiren,
whose face was completely unreadable. Nesune, of course, took in
everything, bird-like eyes darting this way and that.</p>

<p>Right then, Egwene was very glad of the cloak he had
woven for her. She started to dab at her face with the handkerchief
she still held, then froze. He said he would fix it to the floor.
Had he? Light, she might be standing there naked for all she knew.
Except that Nesune&rsquo;s gaze swept past without pausing. Sweat
rolled down Egwene&rsquo;s face. It poured. Burn the man! She would
have been perfectly happy hiding under his bed.</p>

<p>Behind the Aes Sedai came a full dozen more women,
plainly dressed, with coarse linen dustcloaks hanging down their
backs. Most were stocky, but they labored under the weight of two
chests, not small, the polished brass strapping worked with the
Flame of Tar Valon. The serving women set the chests down with
audible sighs of relief, furtively working arms and knuckling backs
as the doors swung shut, and Coiren and the other two sank into
curtsies in perfect unison, though not very deeply.</p>

<p>Rand was down out of the chair before they
straightened. The glow of <em>saidar</em> surrounded the Aes Sedai,
all three together; they had linked. Egwene tried to remember what
she had seen, how they did it; despite the glow, nothing ruffled
their outward calm as Rand strode by them to the serving women and
peered into each face in turn.</p>

<p>What was he&mdash;? Of course; making sure none had
the ageless face of an Aes Sedai. Egwene shook her head, then froze
again. He was a fool if he thought that enough. Most wore too much
age&mdash;not all old by any means, but you could put an age to
them&mdash;yet two were young enough to be Aes Sedai not long
raised. They were not&mdash;Egwene could only sense the ability in
the three Aes Sedai, and she was close enough&mdash;but he
certainly could not tell by looking.</p>

<p>Tipping up one solid young woman&rsquo;s chin, he
smiled into her eyes. &ldquo;Do not be afraid,&rdquo; he said softly. She
swayed as if she might faint. With a sigh, Rand spun on his heel.
He did not look at the Aes Sedai as he passed them. &ldquo;You will not
channel around me,&rdquo; he said firmly. &ldquo;Let it go.&rdquo; A brief look of
speculation crossed Nesune&rsquo;s face, but the other two serenely
watched him take his seat. Rubbing his arm&mdash;Egwene had been
there when he learned that tingle&mdash;he spoke in a harder tone.
 &ldquo;I said you will not channel around me. Or even embrace
<em>saidar</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A stretched-out moment, while Egwene prayed silently.
What would he do if they held on to the Source? Try to cut them
off? Cutting a woman off from <em>saidar</em> once she embraced it
was far harder than shielding her beforehand. She was not certain
even he could manage it with three women, and linked to boot.
Worse, what would they do if he tried anything at all? The glow
vanished, and she barely stopped a heavy sigh of relief. Whatever
he had done made her invisible, but plainly it did not stop
sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much better.&rdquo; Rand&rsquo;s smile took them all in,
but it never reached his eyes. &ldquo;Let us begin again from the
beginning. You are honored guests, you only entered this very
moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They understood, of course. He had not been guessing.
Coiren stiffened slightly, and the raven-haired woman&rsquo;s eyes
actually widened. Nesune merely nodded to herself, adding to her
mental notes. Egwene hoped desperately that he would be careful.
Nesune would not miss anything.</p>

<p>With a visible effort Coiren gathered herself,
smoothing her dress and very nearly adjusting the shawl she was not
wearing. &ldquo;I have the honor,&rdquo; she announced in ringing tones, &ldquo;to be
Coiren Saeldain Aes Sedai, Ambassador from the White Tower and
emissary of Elaida do Avriny a&rsquo;Roihan, the Watcher of the
Seals, the Flame of Tar Valon, the Amyrlin Seat.&rdquo; Somewhat less
florid introductions, though with the full honorific Aes Sedai,
named the other two; the hard-eyed woman was Galina Casban.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo; The simplicity was a marked
contrast. They had not mentioned the Dragon Reborn and neither had
he, but somehow his leaving it out seemed to make the title whisper
faintly in the room.</p>

<p>Coiren drew a deep breath, moved her head as if
hearing that whisper. &ldquo;We bring a gracious invitation to the Dragon
Reborn. The Amyrlin Seat is fully cognizant that signs have been
given and prophecies fulfilled, that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Those deep round tones
took little time to reach the point, that Rand should accompany
them, &ldquo;in all honor as deserved,&rdquo; to the White Tower, and that if
he accepted this invitation, Elaida offered not only the protection
of the Tower, but the full weight of its authority and influence
behind him. Another goodly bit of flowery speech flowed before she
finished with, &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and in token of this, the Amyrlin Seat sends
this trifling gift.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned toward the chests, raising her hand, then
hesitated with the faintest grimace. She had to gesture twice
before the servants understood and lifted the brass-strapped lids;
apparently she had planned to fling them open with <em>saidar</em>.
Leather sacks filled the chests. At another, sharper, gesture, the
serving women began untying them.</p>

<p>Egwene swallowed a gasp. No wonder those women had
struggled! The opened sacks spilled gold coins of every size,
sparkling rings and glittering necklaces and unset gems. Even if
those below held dross, it was a fortune.</p>

<p>Leaning back in that thronelike chair, Rand looked at
the chests with a near smile. The Aes Sedai studied him, faces
masks of composure, yet Egwene thought she detected a hint of
complacency in Coiren&rsquo;s eyes, a faint increase of contempt on
Galina&rsquo;s full lips. Nesune&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Nesune was the real
danger.</p>

<p>Abruptly the lids snapped down without a hand
touching them, and the serving women leaped back, not bothering to
muffle their squeals. The Aes Sedai stiffened, and Egwene prayed as
hard as she sweated. She wanted him arrogant and a touch insolent,
but just enough to put their backs up, not to the point of making
them decide to try gentling him on the spot.</p>

<p>Suddenly it occurred to her that so far he had shown
nothing of that &ldquo;humble as a mouse.&rdquo; He had never intended to. The
man had been toying with her! If she were not too frightened to be
sure of her knees, she would go over and box his ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great deal of gold,&rdquo; Rand said. He seemed relaxed,
his smile taking in his whole face. &ldquo;I can always find a use for
gold.&rdquo; Egwene blinked. He sounded almost greedy!</p>

<p>Coiren answered with a smile of her own, a definite
picture of poised self-satisfaction now. &ldquo;The Amyrlin Seat is, of
course, most generous. When you reach the White Tower&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I reach the Tower,&rdquo; Rand cut in as though
thinking aloud. &ldquo;Yes, I look forward to the day I stand in the
Tower.&rdquo; He leaned forward, elbow on his knee and Dragon Scepter
dangling. &ldquo;It will take a little time, you understand. I have
commitments to meet first, here, in Andor, elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coiren&rsquo;s mouth tightened for just an instant.
Her voice remained as smooth and round as ever, though. &ldquo;We surely
have no objections to resting a few days before we begin the return
journey to Tar Valon. In the meanwhile, may I suggest that one of
us remain close at hand, to offer advice should you wish it? We
have, of course, heard of Moiraine&rsquo;s unfortunate demise. I
cannot offer myself, but Nesune or Galina would be most
willing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand studied the named pair with a frown, and Egwene
held her breath. He seemed to be listening to something again, or
listening for something. Nesune examined him in return as openly as
he did her. Galina&rsquo;s fingers stroked her skirts
unconsciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said at last, sitting back with his arms on
the arms of the chair. He made it look even more a throne than
before. &ldquo;It might not be safe. I would not like one of you to take
a spear through your ribs by accident.&rdquo; Coiren opened her mouth,
but he rode over her. &ldquo;For your own safety, none of you should come
closer to me than a mile without permission. Best if you stay that
far from the Palace without permission, too. You will know when
I&rsquo;m ready to go with you. I promise that.&rdquo; Abruptly he was on
his feet. Atop the dais he stood tall enough that the Aes Sedai had
to crane their necks, and it was plain none of them liked it any
more than they liked his restrictions. Three faces carved in stone
stared up at him. &ldquo;I will let you go back to your resting now. The
quicker I can see to certain things, the quicker I can go to the
Tower. I will send word when I can see you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were not pleased at so sudden a dismissal, or
likely at any dismissal&mdash;Aes Sedai were the ones who said
when an audience was done&mdash;yet there was little they could do
except make their minimal curtsies, disgruntlement nearly breaking
through Aes Sedai calm.</p>

<p>As they turned to go, Rand spoke again, casually. &ldquo;I
forgot to ask. How is Alviarin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is well.&rdquo; Galina&rsquo;s mouth hung open for a
moment, her eyes widening. She appeared startled to have
spoken.</p>

<p>Coiren hesitated on the brink of using the opening to
say more, but Rand stood impatiently, all but tapping his foot.
When they were gone, he stepped down, hefting that spearhead and
staring at the doors that had closed behind them.</p>

<p>Egwene wasted not a moment striding toward him. &ldquo;What
game are you playing at, Rand al&rsquo;Thor?&rdquo; She had taken half a
dozen steps before a glimpse of her reflection in the mirrors made
her realize she had walked right through his weave of
<em>saidin</em>. At least she had not known when it touched her.
 &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s one of Alviarin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said
thoughtfully. &ldquo;Galina. She is one of Alviarin&rsquo;s friends.
I&rsquo;d bet on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Planting herself in front of him, she sniffed.
 &ldquo;You&rsquo;d lose your coin and stick yourself in the foot with a
pitchfork, too. Galina is a Red, or I never saw one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because she doesn&rsquo;t like me?&rdquo; He was looking at
her now, and she almost wished he was not. &ldquo;Because she&rsquo;s
afraid of me?&rdquo; He was not grimacing or glaring, or even staring
particularly hard, yet his eyes seemed to know things she did not.
She <em>hated</em> that. His smile came so suddenly she blinked.
 &ldquo;Egwene, do you expect me to believe you can tell a woman&rsquo;s
Ajah by her face?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway, even Reds might end following me. They know
the Prophecies as well as anybody else. &lsquo;The unstained tower
breaks and bends knee to the forgotten sign&rsquo;. Written before
there was a White Tower, but what else could &lsquo;the unstained
tower&rsquo; be? And the forgotten sign? My banner, Egwene, with the
ancient symbol of Aes Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn you, Rand al&rsquo;Thor!&rdquo; The curse came more
awkwardly than she could have wished; she was not accustomed to
saying such things. &ldquo;The Light burn you! You can&rsquo;t really be
thinking of going with them. You can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He showed his teeth in amusement. Amusement!
 &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I do what you wanted? What you told me to do
<em>and</em> what you wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her lips compressed indignantly. Bad enough that he
knew, but throwing it in her face was just rude. &ldquo;Rand, please
listen to me. Elaida&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The question now is how to get you back to the tents
without them finding out you were here. I expect they have
eyes-and-ears in the Palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand, you have to&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about riding in one of those big laundry
baskets? I can have a couple of Maidens carry it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She very nearly threw up her hands. He was as eager
to be rid of her as he had been of the Aes Sedai. &ldquo;My own feet will
do well enough, thank you.&rdquo; A laundry basket, indeed! &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry if you told me how you step from
Caemlyn to here whenever you want.&rdquo; She did not understand why
asking should rasp so, yet it did. &ldquo;I know you can&rsquo;t teach me,
but if you told me how, maybe I could work out how to do it with
<em>saidar</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead of the joke at her expense she more than
half-expected, he took the end of her shawl in both hands. &ldquo;The
Pattern,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Caemlyn,&rdquo; one finger on his left hand tented
the wool, &ldquo;and Cairhien.&rdquo; A finger on the other hand made a tent,
and he brought the two tents together. &ldquo;I bend the Pattern and bore
a hole from one to the other. I don&rsquo;t know what I bore
through, but there&rsquo;s no space between one end of the hole and
the other.&rdquo; He let the shawl drop. &ldquo;Does that help?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chewing her lip, she frowned at the shawl sourly. It
did not help at all. Just the thought of tearing a hole in the
Pattern made her queasy. She had hoped it would be like something
she had worked out concerning <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>.
Not that she ever meant to use it, of course, but she had had all
that time on her hands, and the Wise Ones kept grumbling about the
Aes Sedai asking how to enter in the flesh. She thought the way
would be to create&mdash;a similarity seemed the only way to
describe it&mdash;a similarity between the real world and its
reflection in the World of Dreams. That should make a place where
it was possible to simply step from one to the other. If
Rand&rsquo;s method of travel had seemed even slightly the same, she
would have been willing to try, but this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>saidar</em> did
as you wanted as long as you remembered it was infinitely stronger
than you and had to be guided gently; try to force the wrong thing,
and you were dead or burned out before you could scream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand, are you sure there isn&rsquo;t any sense of
making things the same&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She did not know how to put
it, but in any case, he shook his head before she trailed off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds like changing the weave of the Pattern.
I think it would tear me apart if I so much as tried. I bore a
hole.&rdquo; He poked a finger at her to demonstrate.</p>

<p>Well, there was no point in pursuing that. She
shifted her shawl irritably. &ldquo;Rand, about those Sea Folk. I
don&rsquo;t know any more than I&rsquo;ve read&rdquo;&mdash;she did, but
she still was not going to tell him&mdash;&ldquo;but it must be
something important to bring them this far to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light,&rdquo; he muttered absently, &ldquo;you jump around like
a drop of water on a hot griddle. I&rsquo;ll see them when I have
time.&rdquo; For a moment he rubbed at his forehead, and his eyes seemed
to see nothing. With a blink he was seeing her again. &ldquo;Do you
intend to stay until they come back?&rdquo; He really did want to be rid
of her.</p>

<p>At the door she paused, but he was already stalking
up the room, hands clasped behind his back, talking to himself.
Softly, but she could make out some. &ldquo;Where are you hiding, burn
you? I know you&rsquo;re there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shivering, she let herself out. If he really was
going mad already, there was no changing it. The Wheel weaved as
the Wheel willed, and its weaving must be accepted.</p>

<p>Realizing that she was eyeing the servants passing up
and down the hall, wondering which might be Aes Sedai agents, she
made herself stop. The Wheel weaved as the Wheel willed. With a nod
for Somara, she squared her shoulders and tried very hard not to
scuttle on her way to the nearest servants&rsquo; entrance.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">There was little talk as Arilyn&rsquo;s best coach
lurched away from the Sun Palace followed by the wagon that had
borne the chests, burdened now only with the serving women and
driver. Steepling her fingers in the coach, Nesune tapped them
thoughtfully against her lips. A fascinating young man. A
fascinating subject for study. Her foot touched one of the specimen
boxes under the seat; she never went anywhere without proper
specimen boxes. One would think that the world must have been
catalogued long since, yet since leaving Tar Valon she had tucked
away fifty plants, twice as many insects, and the skins and bones
of a fox, three sorts of lark, and no fewer than five species of
ground squirrel that she was sure were nowhere in the records.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not realize you were friendly with Alviarin,&rdquo;
Coiren said after a time.</p>

<p>Galina sniffed. &ldquo;It is not necessary to be friends to
know she was well when we left.&rdquo; Nesune wondered whether the woman
knew that she pouted. Only the shape of her mouth perhaps, but one
had to learn to live with one&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Do you think he truly
knew?&rdquo; Galina went on. &ldquo;That we had&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it is impossible. He must
have been guessing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nesune&rsquo;s ears perked, though she continued to
tap her lips. That was clearly an effort to change the subject, and
a sign that Galina was nervous besides. Silence had held as long as
it did because no one wanted to mention al&rsquo;Thor and there
seemed no other topic possible. Why did Galina not want to speak of
Alviarin? The two certainly were not friends; it was a rare Red who
had a friend outside her Ajah. Nesune filed the question in its own
mental cubbyhole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he was guessing, he could make his fortune at the
fairs.&rdquo; Coiren was no fool. Bombastic beyond all reason, but never
a fool. &ldquo;However ridiculous it might seem, we must assume he can
sense <em>saidar</em> in a woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That might be disastrous,&rdquo; Galina muttered. &ldquo;No. It
cannot be. He must have guessed. Any man who can channel would
assume we would embrace <em>saidar</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman&rsquo;s pout irritated Nesune. This entire
expedition irritated her. She would have been more than happy to
join it if asked, but Jesse Bilal had not asked; Jesse had
practically shoved her onto her horse physically. However it might
be in other Ajahs, the head of the Browns&rsquo; council was not
expected to behave so. Worst of all, though, Nesune&rsquo;s
companions were so focused on young al&rsquo;Thor that they seemed
to have gone blind to all else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you have any notions,&rdquo; she mused aloud, &ldquo;as to
the sister who shared our interview?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It might not have been a sister&mdash;three Aiel
women seemed to turn up when she went into the Royal Library, and
two could channel&mdash;but she wanted to see their reactions. She
was not disappointed; or rather, she was. Coiren only sat up
straight, but Galina stared. It was all Nesune could do not to
sigh. They truly were blind. Only a few paces from a woman able to
channel, and they had not sensed her because they could not see
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how she was hidden,&rdquo; Nesune went
on, &ldquo;but it will be interesting to discover.&rdquo; It had to have been
his work; they would have seen any weaving of <em>saidar</em>. They
did not ask whether she was sure; they knew she always identified a
guess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confirmation that Moiraine is alive.&rdquo; Galina settled
back with a grim smile. &ldquo;I suggest we set Beldeine to find her.
Then we take her and bundle her into the basement. That takes her
away from al&rsquo;Thor, and we can carry her to Tar Valon along
with him. I doubt he&rsquo;ll even notice, so long as we let enough
gold glitter under his nose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coiren shook her head emphatically. &ldquo;We have no more
confirmation than we already had, not of Moiraine. It may be this
mysterious Green. As far as finding whoever it is, I agree, but we
must consider the rest carefully. I will not risk everything that
has been so carefully planned. We must be aware that al&rsquo;Thor
is connected to this sister&mdash;whoever she may be&mdash;and
that his plea for time may be only a strategy. Fortunately, we have
time.&rdquo; Galina nodded, however reluctantly; she would marry and
settle on a farm before she risked their plans.</p>

<p>Nesune allowed herself a small sigh. Aside from
pomposity, stating the obvious was Coiren&rsquo;s only real fault.
She did have a good mind, when she used it. And they did have time.
Her foot touched one of the specimen boxes again. However events
spun out, the paper she intended to write on al&rsquo;Thor would be
the culmination of her life.</p>
