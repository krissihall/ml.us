Taim. Before Rand, other men through the
centuries had claimed to be the Dragon Reborn. The last few years
before Rand had seen a plague of false Dragons, some of whom could
actually channel. Mazrim Taim was one of those, raising an army and
ravaging Saldaea before he was taken. Bashere&rsquo;s face did not
change, but he gripped his sword hilt white-knuckle hard, and Tumad
was looking at him for orders. Taim&rsquo;s escape, on the way to
Tar Valon to be gentled, was the reason Bashere had come to Andor
in the first place. That was how much Saldaea feared and hated
Mazrim Taim; Queen Tenobia had sent Bashere with an army to pursue
the man wherever he went, however long it took, to make sure Taim
never troubled Saldaea again.</p>

<p>The Maidens merely stood calmly, but that name burst
among the Andorans like a torch tossed in dry grass. Arymilla was
just being helped to her feet, yet her eyes rolled up in her head
again; she would have gone down in a heap once more if Karind had
not eased her to the paving stones. Elegar staggered back among the
columns and bent over, retching loudly. The rest were all gasps and
panic, pressing handkerchiefs to mouths and clutching at sword
hilts. Even stolid Karind licked her lips nervously.</p>

<p>Rand took his hand away from his coat pocket. &ldquo;The
amnesty,&rdquo; he said, and both Saldaeans gave him a long flat
look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if he has not come for your amnesty?&rdquo; Bashere
said after a moment. &ldquo;What if he still claims to be the Dragon
Reborn?&rdquo; Feet shuffled among the Andorans; no one wanted to be
within miles of where the One Power might be used in a duel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he thinks that,&rdquo; Rand said firmly, &ldquo;I will
disabuse him.&rdquo; He had the rarest sort of <em>angreal</em> in his
pocket, one made for men, a carving of a fat little man with a
sword. However strong Taim might be, he could not stand up to that.
 &ldquo;But if he has come for the amnesty, it is his, the same as any
other.&rdquo; Whatever Taim had done in Saldaea, he could not afford to
turn away a man who could channel, a man who would not have to be
taught from the first steps. He needed such a man. He would turn
away no one except one of the Forsaken, not unless he was forced
to. <em>Demandred and Sammael, Semirhage and Mesaana, Asmodean
and</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Rand forced Lews Therin down; he could not afford
distractions now.</p>

<p>Again Bashere paused before speaking, but finally he
nodded and let go of his sword. &ldquo;Your amnesty holds, of course. But
mark me, al&rsquo;Thor. If Taim ever sets foot in Saldaea again, he
will not live to leave. There are too many memories. No command I
give&mdash;nor Tenobia herself&mdash;will stop it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will keep him out of Saldaea.&rdquo; Either Taim had
come here to submit to him, or else it was going to be necessary to
kill him. Unconsciously Rand touched his pocket, pressing the fat
little man through the wool. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have him in here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tumad eyed Bashere, but Bashere&rsquo;s short nod came
so quickly that it seemed Tumad bowed in response to the spoken
command. Irritation flashed in Rand, but he said nothing, and Tumad
hurried away in that slightly rolling walk. Bashere folded his arms
across his chest and stood with one knee bent, a portrait of a man
at his ease. Those dark tilted eyes, fixed on the way Tumad had
gone, made it a portrait of a man waiting to kill something.</p>

<p>The scuffling of feet started again among the
Andorans, hesitant half-steps away then pulling back. Their
breathing sounded as though they had run miles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may leave,&rdquo; Rand told them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I for one will stand at your shoulder,&rdquo; Lir began
just as Naean said sharply, &ldquo;I will not run before&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand cut them both off. &ldquo;Go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They wanted to show him they were unafraid, even if
they were ready to soil themselves; they wanted to run, abandoning
what dignity they had not already tossed at his feet. It was a
simple choice. He was the Dragon Reborn, and currying favor meant
obedience, and obedience in this case meant doing what they truly
wanted. A flurry of extravagant bows and deep skirt-spreading
curtsies, hurried murmurs of &ldquo;By your leave, my Lord Dragon&rdquo; and
 &ldquo;As you command, my Lord Dragon,&rdquo; and they were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;not exactly
scurrying out, but walking as quickly as they could manage without
appearing to scurry. In the opposite direction from that in which
Tumad had gone; no doubt they did not want to risk a chance
encounter with Mazrim Taim on his way in.</p>

<p>The waiting stretched out in the heat&mdash;it took
time to bring a man through the sprawling corridors from the Palace
gates&mdash;but once the Andorans were gone no one moved. Bashere
kept his gaze steady on the place Taim would appear. The Maidens
watched everywhere, but they always did, and if they looked ready
to veil themselves again in an instant, they always did that too.
Except for their eyes, they could have been statues.</p>

<p>Finally the sound of boots echoed into the courtyard.
Rand almost reached out for <em>saidin</em>, then held back. The
man would be able to tell he held the Power as soon as he entered
the court; Rand could not afford to appear afraid of him.</p>

<p>Tumad emerged into the sunlight first, then a
black-haired man of slightly above average height whose dark face
and tilted eyes, hooked nose and high cheekbones, marked him
another Saldaean, though he was clean-shaven and garbed like a once
prosperous Andoran merchant lately fallen on hard times. His dark
blue coat had been of fine wool trimmed in darker velvet, but wear
had made the cuffs ragged, his breeches bagged at the knee, and
dust coated his cracked boots. Still, he walked proudly, no mean
feat with four more of Bashere&rsquo;s men behind him, those almost
straight, slightly serpentine blades bare and the points inches
from his ribs. The heat hardly seemed to touch him. The
Maidens&rsquo; eyes followed his progress.</p>

<p>Rand studied Taim as the man and his escort crossed
the courtyard. At least fifteen years older than himself;
thirty-five, then, or a few years more at most. Little was known
and less written of men who could channel&mdash;it was a subject
most decent people avoided&mdash;but Rand had learned what he
could. Relatively few men actually sought it out; that was one of
Rand&rsquo;s problems. Since the Breaking, most men who channeled
had the ability born in them, ready to spring out as they grew into
manhood. Some managed to keep madness at bay for years before Aes
Sedai found and gentled them; others were already hopelessly mad
when found, at times less than a year after first touching <em>
saidin</em>. Rand had clung to sanity for close to two years, so
far. Yet in front of him he had a man who must have managed it for
ten or fifteen. That alone was worth something.</p>

<p>They halted a few paces before him at a gesture from
Tumad. Rand opened his mouth, but before he could speak, Lews
Therin rose up in a frenzy in his head. <em>Sammael and Demandred
hated me, whatever honors I gave them. The more honors, the worse
the hate, until they sold their souls and went over. Demandred
especially. I should have killed him! I should have killed them
all! Scorched the earth to kill them all! Scorch the
earth!</em></p>

<p>Face frozen, Rand fought for his own mind. <em>I am
Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Rand al&rsquo;Thor! I never knew Sammael or
Demandred or any of them! The Light burn me, I am Rand
al&rsquo;Thor!</em> Like a faint echo, one more thought came from
elsewhere. <em>The Light burn me</em>. It sounded like a plea. Then
Lews Therin was gone, driven back into whatever shadows he lived
in.</p>

<p>Bashere took advantage of the silence. &ldquo;You say
you&rsquo;re Mazrim Taim?&rdquo; He sounded doubtful, and Rand looked at
him in confusion. Was this Taim or not? Only a madman would claim
that name if it was not his.</p>

<p>The prisoner&rsquo;s mouth quirked in what might have
been the beginning of a smile, and he rubbed his chin. &ldquo;I shaved,
Bashere.&rdquo; His voice held more than a hint of mockery. &ldquo;It is hot
this far south, or had you not noticed? Hotter than it should be,
even here. Do you want proof of me? Shall I channel for you?&rdquo; His
dark eyes flickered to Rand, then back to Bashere, whose face was
growing darker by the minute. &ldquo;Perhaps not that, not now. I
remember you. I had you beat at Irinjavar, until those visions
appeared in the sky. But everyone knows that. What does everyone
not know, that you and Mazrim Taim will?&rdquo; Focused on Bashere, he
seemed unaware of his guards, or their swords still hovering near
his ribs. &ldquo;I hear you hid what happened to Musar and Hachari and
their wives.&rdquo; The mockery was gone; he was just relating what had
happened, now. &ldquo;They shouldn&rsquo;t have tried to kill me under a
parley flag. I trust you found them good places as servants? All
they&rsquo;ll really want to do now is serve and obey; they
won&rsquo;t be happy otherwise. I could have killed them. They all
four drew daggers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Taim,&rdquo; Bashere growled, hand darting for his hilt,
 &ldquo;you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand stepped in front of him, seizing his wrist with
the blade half-drawn. The guards&rsquo; blades, Tumad&rsquo;s as
well, were touching Taim now, very likely touching flesh the way
they were shoved against his coat, but he did not flinch. &ldquo;Did you
come to see me,&rdquo; Rand demanded, &ldquo;or to taunt Lord Bashere? If you
do it again, I&rsquo;ll let him kill you. My amnesty pardons what
you&rsquo;ve done, but it doesn&rsquo;t let you flaunt your
crimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taim studied Rand a moment before speaking. Despite
the heat, the fellow barely sweated. &ldquo;To see you. You were the one
in the vision in the sky. They say it was the Dark One himself you
fought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the Dark One,&rdquo; Rand said. Bashere was not
fighting him exactly, but he could feel the tension in the
man&rsquo;s arm. If he let go, that blade would be out and through
Taim in a heartbeat. Unless he used the Power. Or Taim did. That
had to be avoided, if it could be. He kept his grip on
Bashere&rsquo;s wrist. &ldquo;He called himself Ba&rsquo;alzamon, but I
think he was Ishamael. I killed him later, in the Stone of
Tear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear you&rsquo;ve killed a number of the Forsaken.
Should I call you my Lord Dragon? I have heard this lot use the
title. Do you mean to kill all the Forsaken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know any other way to deal with them?&rdquo; Rand
asked. &ldquo;They die, or the world does. Unless you think they can be
talked into abandoning the Shadow the way they abandoned the
Light.&rdquo; This was becoming ridiculous. Here he was, carrying on a
conversation with a man who certainly had five sword points drawing
blood beneath his coat while he himself held on to another man who
wanted to add a sixth and draw more than a trickle. At least
Bashere&rsquo;s men were too disciplined to do more without their
general&rsquo;s word. At least Bashere was keeping his mouth shut.
Admiring Taim&rsquo;s coolness, Rand went on as quickly as he could
without seeming to be hurried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever your crimes are, Taim, they pale beside the
Forsaken&rsquo;s. Have you ever tortured an entire city, made
thousands of people assist in breaking each other slowly, in
breaking their own loved ones? Semirhage did that, for no more
reason than that she could, to prove she could, for the pleasure of
it. Have you murdered children? Graendal did. She called it
kindness, so they would not suffer after she enslaved their parents
and carried them away.&rdquo; He just hoped the other Saldaeans were
listening half as closely as Taim; the man had actually leaned
forward slightly in interest. He hoped they did not ask too many
questions about where all this came from. &ldquo;Have you given people to
Trollocs to eat? All the Forsaken did&mdash;prisoners who would
not turn always went to the Trollocs, if they weren&rsquo;t murdered
out of hand&mdash;but Demandred captured two cities just because
he thought the people there had slighted him before he went over to
the Shadow, and every man, woman and child went into Trolloc
bellies. Mesaana set up schools in the territory she controlled,
schools where children and young people were taught the glories of
the Dark One, taught to kill their friends who didn&rsquo;t learn
well enough or fast enough. I could go on. I could start from the
beginning of the list and go through all thirteen names, adding a
hundred crimes as bad to every name. Whatever you&rsquo;ve done, it
doesn&rsquo;t rank with that. And now you&rsquo;ve come to accept my
pardon, to walk in the Light and submit to me, to battle the Dark
One as hard as you ever battled anyone. The Forsaken are reeling; I
mean to hunt them all down, eradicate them. And you will help me.
For that, you&rsquo;ve earned your pardon. I tell you true,
you&rsquo;ll probably earn it a hundred times over again before the
Last Battle is done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last he felt Bashere&rsquo;s arm relax, felt the
man&rsquo;s sword sliding back into its scabbard. Rand barely
stopped himself from exhaling in relief. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any
reason to guard him so closely now. Put up your swords.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly, Tumad and the others began sheathing their
blades. Slowly, but they were doing it. Then Taim spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Submit? I had thought more of a compact between us.&rdquo;
The other Saldaeans tensed; Bashere was still behind Rand, but Rand
could <em>feel</em> him stiffening. The Maidens did not move a
muscle, except that Jalani&rsquo;s hand twitched toward her veil.
Taim tilted his head, unaware. &ldquo;I would be the lesser partner, of
course, yet I have had years more than you to study the Power.
There is much I could teach you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rage rose up in Rand till his vision filmed red. He
had spoken of things he should have no knowledge of, had probably
birthed a dozen rumors about himself and the Forsaken, all to make
this fellow&rsquo;s deeds seem less dark, and the man had the
audacity to speak of <em>compacts</em>? Lews Therin raved in his
head. <em>Kill him! Kill him now! Kill him!</em> For once Rand did
not bother to quell the voice. &ldquo;No compact!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;No
partners! I am the Dragon Reborn, Taim! Me! If you have knowledge I
can make use of, I will, but you will go where I say, do as I say,
when I say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without a pause Taim slipped to one knee. &ldquo;I submit
to the Dragon Reborn. I will serve and obey.&rdquo; The corners of his
mouth quivered again in that almost smile as he rose. Tumad gaped
at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That fast?&rdquo; Rand said softly. The rage was not gone;
it was white hot. If he gave way, he was not sure what he would do.
Lews Therin still babbled in the shadows of his head. <em>Kill him!
Must kill him!</em> Rand pushed Lews Therin away, to a barely
audible murmur. Perhaps he should not be surprised at this; strange
things happened around <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, especially one as
strong as himself. That a man might change his mind in a moment,
even if his course had been carved in stone, should be no great
surprise. But the anger had him, and a strong streak of suspicion.
 &ldquo;You named yourself the Dragon Reborn, fought battles all over
Saldaea, were only captured because you were knocked unconscious,
and you give up this quickly? Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taim shrugged. &ldquo;What are my choices? To wander the
world alone, friendless, hunted, while you rise to glory?
That&rsquo;s supposing Bashere doesn&rsquo;t manage to kill me before
I can leave the city, or your Aiel women don&rsquo;t. Even if they
don&rsquo;t, the Aes Sedai will corner me sooner or later; I doubt
the Tower means to forget Mazrim Taim. Or I can follow you, and
part of that glory will be mine.&rdquo; For the first time he looked
around, at his guards, at the Maidens, and shook his head as if he
could not believe it. &ldquo;I might have been the one. How could I be
sure otherwise? I can channel; I&rsquo;m strong. What said I was not
the Dragon Reborn? All I had to do was fulfill just one of the
Prophecies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like managing to be born on the slopes of
Dragonmount?&rdquo; Rand said coldly. &ldquo;That was the first Prophecy to be
met.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taim&rsquo;s mouth quirked again. It really was not a
smile; it never touched his eyes. &ldquo;Victors write history. Had I
taken the Stone of Tear, history would have shown I was born on
Dragonmount, of a woman never touched by a man, and the heavens
opened up in radiance to herald my coming. The sort of thing they
say about you, now. But you took the Stone with your Aiel, and the
world hails you as the Dragon Reborn. I know better than to stand
against that; you are the one. Well, since the whole loaf
won&rsquo;t be mine, I will settle for whatever slices fall my
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may find honors, Taim, and you may not. If you
begin to fret over them, think what happened to the others
who&rsquo;ve done what you did. Logain, captured and gentled; rumor
says he died in the Tower. A nameless fellow beheaded in Haddon
Mirk by the Tairens. Another burned by the Murandians. Burned
alive, Taim! That&rsquo;s what the Illianers did to Gorin Rogad four
years ago, as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a fate I would embrace,&rdquo; Taim said levelly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then forget honors and remember the Last Battle.
Everything I do is aimed at Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don. Everything I tell
you to do will be aimed at it. <em>You</em> will aim at it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Taim spread his hands. &ldquo;You are the
Dragon Reborn. I don&rsquo;t doubt that; I acknowledge it publicly.
We march toward Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don. Which the Prophecies say you
will win. And the histories will say that Mazrim Taim stood at your
right hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Rand told him curtly. He had lived too
many prophecies to believe any of them meant exactly what they
said. Or even that they insured anything. In his opinion, prophecy
set the conditions that had to be met for a thing to happen; only,
meeting them did not mean the thing <em>would</em> happen, just
that it <em>could</em>. Some of the conditions set in the
Prophecies of the Dragon more than implied that he had to die for
any chance at victory. Thinking of that did nothing for his temper.
 &ldquo;The Light send your chance doesn&rsquo;t come too soon. Now. What
knowledge do you have that I need? Can you teach men to channel?
Can you test a man to know whether he can be taught?&rdquo; Unlike women,
one man who could channel could not simply sense the ability in
another. There was as much different between men and women with the
One Power as there was between men and women; sometimes it was a
matter of hair-fine degree, sometimes stone versus silk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your amnesty? Some fools have actually shown up to
learn how to be like you and me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bashere only stared at Taim contemptuously, arms
folded and boots spread apart, but Tumad and the guards shifted
uneasily. The Maidens did not. Rand had no idea how the Maidens
felt about the score of men who had answered his call; they never
gave any sign. With the memory of Taim as a false Dragon strong in
their heads, few of the Saldaeans could hide their ill ease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just answer me, Taim. If you can do what I want, say
so. If not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; That was the anger talking. He could not send
the man away, not if every day was a struggle with him. Taim seemed
to think he would, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can do both,&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;I have found five
over the years&mdash;not that I was really looking&mdash;but only
one had the courage to go beyond the testing.&rdquo; He hesitated, then
added, &ldquo;He went mad after two years. I had to kill him before he
killed me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two years. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve held it off a deal longer
than that. How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worried?&rdquo; Taim asked softly, then shrugged. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t help you. I don&rsquo;t know how; I just did. I&rsquo;m
sane as&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His eyes flickered toward Bashere, ignoring the
other man&rsquo;s flat stare. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;as Lord Bashere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Rand wondered, suddenly. Half the Maidens had
returned to watching the rest of the courtyard; they were not
likely to focus so deeply on one possible threat that they ignored
others. The possible threat was Taim, and the second half of the
Maidens still had their eyes fixed on him and Rand for any sign the
threat was real. Any man would have to be aware of them, sudden
death in their eyes, their hands. Rand was, and they wanted to
protect him. And Tumad and the other guards still gripped their
sword hilts, ready to draw again. If Bashere&rsquo;s men and the
Aiel decided to kill Taim, the man would have a hard time escaping
that courtyard however he channeled, unless Rand helped him. Yet
Taim paid the soldiers and the Maidens no more outward attention
than he did the colonnades&rsquo; columns or the paving stones
beneath his boots. Bravery, real or feigned, or something else? A
kind of madness?</p>

<p>After a moment of silence, Taim spoke again. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t trust me yet. No reason you should. Yet. In time you
will. In token of that future trust, I brought you a present.&rdquo; From
under his worn coat he pulled a rag-wrapped bundle a little larger
than a man&rsquo;s two fists together.</p>

<p>Frowning, Rand took it, and his breath caught when he
felt the hard shape inside. Hastily he pulled away multicolored
rags, revealing a disc the size of his palm, a disc like that on
the scarlet banner above the palace, half white and half black, the
ancient symbol of Aes Sedai, before the Breaking of the World. He
ran his fingers across the mated teardrops.</p>

<p>Only seven like this had been made, of <em>
cuendillar</em>. Seals on the Dark One&rsquo;s prison, seals that
held the Dark One away from the world. He had two more, hidden away
very carefully. Protected very carefully. Nothing could break <em>
cuendillar</em>, not even the One Power&mdash;the lip of a
delicate cup made of heartstone could scratch steel, or diamond&mdash;but three of the seven <em>had</em> been broken. He had seen
them, shattered. And he had watched Moiraine carve a thin sliver
from the edge of one. The seals were weakening, the Light alone
knew why or how. The disc in his hands had the hard slickness of
<em>cuendillar</em>, like a blend of the finest porcelain and
polished steel&mdash;but he was sure it would break if he let it
fall to the stones under his feet.</p>

<p>Three broken. Three in his possession. Where was the
seventh? Only four seals stood between humankind and the Dark One.
Four, if the last was still whole. Only four, standing between
humankind and the Last Battle. How well did they still hold,
weakened as they were?</p>

<p>Lews Therin&rsquo;s voice came up like thunder. <em>
Break it break them all must break them must must must break them
all break them and strike must strike quickly must strike now break
it break it break it</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rand shook with the effort of fighting that voice
down, forcing away a mist that clung like spiderwebs. His muscles
ached as if he wrestled with a man of flesh, a giant. Handful by
handful he stuffed the fog that was Lews Therin into the deepest
crannies, the deepest shadows, he could find in his mind.</p>

<p>Abruptly he heard the words he was muttering
hoarsely. &ldquo;Must break it now break them all break it break it break
it.&rdquo; Abruptly he realized he had his hands over his head, holding
the seal, ready to smash it to the white pavement. The only thing
stopping him was Bashere, up on his toes, hands raised to grip
Rand&rsquo;s arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that is,&rdquo; Bashere said
quietly, &ldquo;but I think maybe you should wait before deciding to
break it. Eh?&rdquo; Tumad and the others were no longer watching Taim;
they gaped wide-eyed at Rand. Even the Maidens had shifted their
eyes to him, eyes full of concern. Sulin took a half step toward
the men, and Jalani&rsquo;s hand was outstretched toward Rand as if
she did not realize it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Rand swallowed; his throat hurt. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think I should.&rdquo; Bashere stepped back slowly, and Rand brought the
seal down just as slowly. If Rand had thought Taim unflappable, he
had proof to the contrary now. Shock painted the man&rsquo;s face.
 &ldquo;Do you know what this is, Taim?&rdquo; Rand demanded. &ldquo;You must, or you
wouldn&rsquo;t have brought it to me. Where did you find it? Do you
have another? Do you know where another is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Taim said, voice unsteady. Not with fear,
precisely; more like a man who had felt a cliff unexpectedly
crumbling under him and had somehow found himself back on solid
ground. &ldquo;That is the only one I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve heard all sorts of
rumors since I escaped the Aes Sedai. Monsters leaping out of thin
air. Strange beasts. Men talking to animals, and the animals
talking back. Aes Sedai going mad like we&rsquo;re supposed to.
Whole villages going mad, killing each other. Some could be true.
Half what I know to be true is no less insane. I heard some of the
seals have been broken. A hammer could break that one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bashere frowned, stared at the seal in Rand&rsquo;s
hands, then gasped. He understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you find it?&rdquo; Rand repeated. If he could
find the last&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;then what? Lews Therin stirred, but he refused
to listen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the last place you would expect,&rdquo; Taim replied,
 &ldquo;which I suppose is the first place to look for the others. A
decaying little farm in Saldaea. I stopped for water, and the
farmer gave it to me. He was old, with no children or grandchildren
to pass it on to, and he thought I was the Dragon Reborn. He
claimed his family had guarded it more than two thousand years.
Claimed they were kings and queens during the Trolloc Wars, and
nobles under Artur Hawkwing. His tale could have been true. No more
unlikely than finding that in a hut only a few days ride from the
Blightborder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded, then stooped to gather up the rags. He
was used to the unlikely happening around him; it had to happen
elsewhere, sometimes. Hurriedly rewrapping the seal, he handed it
to Bashere. &ldquo;Guard this carefully.&rdquo; <em>Break it!</em> He squashed
the voice hard. &ldquo;Nothing must happen to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bashere took the bundle reverently in both hands.
Rand was unsure whether the man&rsquo;s bow was for him or the seal.
 &ldquo;For ten hours or ten years, it will be safe until you require
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Rand studied him. &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s
waiting for me to go mad, afraid of it, but not you. You must have
thought I finally was, just now, but you weren&rsquo;t afraid of me
even then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bashere shrugged, grinning behind his gray-streaked
mustaches. &ldquo;When I first slept in a saddle, Muad Cheade was
Marshal-General. The man was as mad as a hare in spring thaw. Twice
every day he searched his bodyservant for poison, and he drank
nothing but vinegar and water, which he claimed was sovereign
against the poison the fellow fed him, but he ate everything the
man prepared for as long as I knew him. Once he had a grove of oaks
chopped down because they were looking at him. And then insisted
they be given decent funerals; he gave the oration. Do you have any
idea how long it takes to dig graves for twenty-three oak
trees?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t somebody do something? His
family?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those not mad as he was, or madder, were afraid to
look at him sideways. Tenobia&rsquo;s father wouldn&rsquo;t have let
anyone touch Cheade anyway. He might have been insane, but he could
out-general anyone I ever saw. He never lost a battle. He never even
came close to losing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand laughed. &ldquo;So you follow me because you think I
can out-general the Dark One?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I follow you because you are who you are,&rdquo; Bashere
said quietly. &ldquo;The world must follow you, or those who survive will
wish themselves dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly Rand nodded. The Prophecies said he would
break nations and bind them together. Not that he wanted to, but
the Prophecies were his only guide to how to fight the Last Battle,
how to win it. Even without them, he thought the binding together
was necessary. The Last Battle would not be just him against the
Dark One. He could not believe that; if he was going mad, he was
not yet mad enough to believe he was more than a man. It would be
mankind against Trollocs and Myrddraal, too, and every sort of
Shadowspawn the Blight could vomit out, and Darkfriends rising out
of their hiding places. There would be other dangers on that road
to Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don, and if the world was not united&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>
You do what must be done</em>. He was not sure whether that was
himself or Lews Therin, but it was the truth, as far as he could
see.</p>

<p>Walking quickly to the nearest colonnade, he spoke
over his shoulder to Bashere. &ldquo;I am taking Taim to the farm. Do you
want to come along?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The farm?&rdquo; Taim said.</p>

<p>Bashere shook his head. &ldquo;Thank you, no,&rdquo; he said
dryly. He might not allow any nerves to show, but Rand and Taim
together were probably as much as he could take; he certainly
avoided the farm. &ldquo;My men are growing soft policing the streets for
you. I mean to put some of them back into their saddles properly
for a few hours. You were going to inspect them this afternoon. Has
that changed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What farm?&rdquo; Taim said.</p>

<p>Rand sighed, suddenly weary. &ldquo;No, that hasn&rsquo;t
changed. I will be there if I can.&rdquo; It was too important to change,
though none but Bashere and Mat knew; he could not let anyone else
think it more than a casual matter, a useless ceremony for a man
growing taken with the pomp of his position, the Dragon Reborn
going out to be cheered by his soldiers. He had another visit to
make today, too, one that everyone would think he was trying to
keep secret. It might even stay secret, from most, but he had no
doubt that those he wanted to learn of it, would.</p>

<p>Taking up his sword from where it stood against one
of the narrow columns, he buckled it on over his undone coat. The
belt was unadorned dark boar-hide, just like the scabbard and the
long hilt; the buckle was ornate, a finely worked dragon of etched
steel inlaid with gold. He should get rid of that buckle, find
something plain. He could not bring himself to do it, though. It
had been a gift from Aviendha. Which was the reason he should rid
himself of it. He could never think his way out of that circle.</p>

<p>Something else waited there for him, too, a two-foot
length of spear with a green-and-white tassel below the sharp head.
He hefted it as he turned back to the courtyard. One of the Maidens
had carved the short shaft with Dragons. Some people were already
calling it the Dragon Scepter, especially Elenia and that lot. Rand
kept the thing close to remind himself that he might have more
enemies than those he could see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What farm are you talking about?&rdquo; Taim&rsquo;s voice
grew harder. &ldquo;Where is it you mean to take me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a long moment Rand studied the man. He did not
like Taim. Something in the fellow&rsquo;s manner would not allow
it. Or maybe something in himself. For so long he had been the only
man who could even think of channeling without looking over his
shoulder in a sweat for Aes Sedai. Well, it seemed a long time, and
at least the Aes Sedai would not try to gentle him, not now that
they knew who he was. Could it be as simple as that? Jealousy that
he was no longer unique? He did not think so. Apart from everything
else, he would welcome more men who could channel walking the earth
unmolested. Finally he would stop being a freak. No, it would not
go that far, not this side of Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don. He was unique;
he was the Dragon Reborn. Whatever his reasons, he just did not
like the man.</p>

<p><em>Kill him!</em> Lews Therin shrieked. <em>Kill
them all!</em> Rand pushed the voice back down. He did not have to
like Taim, only to use him. And trust him. That was the hard
part.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking you where you can serve me,&rdquo; he said
coldly. Taim did not flinch or frown; he merely watched and waited,
the corners of his mouth twitching for one moment in that almost
smile.</p>
