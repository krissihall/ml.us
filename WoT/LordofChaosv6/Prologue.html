<h4><em>The First Message</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">D</span>emandred
stepped out onto the black slopes of Shayol
Ghul, and the gateway, a hole in reality&rsquo;s fabric, winked out
of existence. Above, roiling gray clouds hid the sky, an inverted
sea of sluggish ashen waves crashing around the mountain&rsquo;s
hidden peak. Below, odd lights flashed across the barren valley,
washed-out blues and reds, failing to dispel the dusky murk that
shrouded their source. Lightning streaked up at the clouds, and
slow thunder rolled. Across the slope steam and smoke rose from
scattered vents, some holes as small as a man&rsquo;s hand and some
large enough to swallow ten men.</p>

<p>He released the One Power immediately, and with the
vanished sweetness went the heightened senses that made everything
sharper, clearer. The absence of <em>saidin</em> left him hollow,
yet here only a fool would even appear ready to channel. Besides,
here only a fool would want to see or smell or feel too
clearly.</p>

<p>In what was now called the Age of Legends, this had
been an idyllic island in a cool sea, a favorite of those who
enjoyed the rustic. Despite the steam it was bitter cold, now; he
did not allow himself to feel it, but instinct made him pull his
fur-lined velvet cloak closer. Feathery mist marked his breath,
barely visible before the air drank it. A few hundred leagues north
the world was pure ice, but Thakan&rsquo;dar was always dry as any
desert, though always wrapped in winter.</p>

<p>There was water, of a sort, an inky rivulet oozing
down the rocky slope beside a gray-roofed forge. Hammers rang
inside, and with every ring, white light flared in the cramped
windows. A ragged woman crouched in a hopeless heap against the
forge&rsquo;s rough stone wall, clutching a babe in her arms, and a
spindly girl buried her face in the woman&rsquo;s skirts. Prisoners
from a raid down into the Borderlands, no doubt. But so few; the
Myrddraal must be gnashing their teeth. Their blades failed after a
time and had to be replaced, no matter that raids into the
Borderlands had been curtailed.</p>

<p>One of the forgers emerged, a thick slow-moving man
shape that seemed hacked out of the mountain. The forgers were not
truly alive; carried any distance from Shayol Ghul, they turned to
stone, or dust. Nor were they smiths as such; they made nothing but
the swords. This one&rsquo;s two hands held a sword blade in long
tongs, a blade already quenched, pale like moonlit snow. Alive or
not, the forger took care as it dipped the gleaming metal into the
dark stream. Whatever semblance of life it had could be ended by
the touch of that water. When the metal came out again, it was dead
black. But the making was not done yet. The forger shuffled back
inside, and suddenly a man&rsquo;s voice raised a desperate
shout.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! No! NO!&rdquo; He shrieked then, the sound dwindling
away without losing intensity, as though the screamer had been
yanked into unimaginably far distance. Now the blade was done.</p>

<p>Once more a forger appeared&mdash;perhaps the same,
perhaps another&mdash;and hauled the woman to her feet. Woman,
babe and child began to wail, but the infant was pulled away and
shoved into the girl&rsquo;s arms. At last the woman found a scrap
of resistance. Weeping, she kicked wildly, clawed at the forger. It
paid no more mind than stone would have. The woman&rsquo;s cries
vanished as soon as she was inside. The hammers began ringing
again, drowning the sobs of the children.</p>

<p>One blade made, one making, and two to come.
Demandred had never before seen fewer than fifty prisoners waiting
to give their mite to the Great Lord of the Dark. The Myrddraal
must be gnashing their teeth, indeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you loiter when you have been summoned by the
Great Lord?&rdquo; The voice sounded like rotted leather crumbling.</p>

<p>Demandred turned slowly&mdash;how dare a Halfman
address him in that tone&mdash;but the quelling words died in his
mouth. It was not the eyeless stare of its pasty-pale face; a
Myrddraal&rsquo;s gaze struck fear in any man, but he had rooted
fear out of himself long ago. Rather, it was the black-clad
creature itself. Every Myrddraal was the height of a tall man, a
sinuous imitation of a man, as alike as though cast in one mold.
This one stood head and shoulders taller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will take you to the Great Lord,&rdquo; the Myrddraal
said. &ldquo;I am Shaidar Haran.&rdquo; It turned away and began climbing the
mountain, like a serpent in its fluid motion. Its inky cloak hung
unnaturally still, without even a ripple.</p>

<p>Demandred hesitated before following. Halfmen&rsquo;s
names were always in the Trollocs&rsquo; tongue-wrenching language.
 &ldquo;Shaidar Haran&rdquo; came from what people now named the Old Tongue. It
meant &ldquo;Hand of the Dark.&rdquo; Another surprise, and Demandred did not
like surprises, especially not at Shayol Ghul.</p>

<p>The entry into the mountain could have been one of
the scattered vents, except that it emitted no smoke or steam. It
gaped enough for two men abreast, but the Myrddraal kept the lead.
The way slanted down almost immediately, the tunnel floor worn
smooth as polished tiles. The cold faded as Demandred followed
Shaidar Haran&rsquo;s broad back down and down, slowly replaced by
increasing heat. Demandred was aware of it, but did not let it
touch him. A pale light rose from the stone, filling the tunnel,
brighter than the eternal twilight outside. Jagged spikes jutted
from the ceiling, stony teeth ready to snap shut, the Great
Lord&rsquo;s teeth to rend the unfaithful or the traitor. Not
natural, of course, but effective.</p>

<p>Abruptly, he noticed something. Every time he had
made this journey, those spikes had all but brushed the top of his
head. Now they cleared the Myrddraal&rsquo;s by two hands or more.
That surprised him. Not that the height of the tunnel changed&mdash;the strange was ordinary here&mdash;but the extra space the
Halfman was given. The Great Lord gave his reminders to Myrddraal
as well as men. That extra space was a fact to be remembered.</p>

<p>The tunnel opened out suddenly onto a wide ledge
overlooking a lake of molten stone, red mottled with black, where
man-high flames danced, died and rose again. There was no roof,
only a great hole rising through the mountain to a sky that was not
the sky of Thakan&rsquo;dar. It made that of Thakan&rsquo;dar look
normal, with its wildly striated clouds streaking by as though
driven by the greatest winds the world had ever seen. This, men
called the Pit of Doom, and few knew how well they had named
it.</p>

<p>Even after all his visits&mdash;and the first lay
well over three thousand years in the past&mdash;Demandred felt
awe. Here he could sense the Bore, the hole drilled through so long
ago to where the Great Lord had lain imprisoned since the moment of
Creation. Here the Great Lord&rsquo;s presence washed over him.
Physically, this place was no closer to the Bore than any other in
the world, but here there was a thinness in the Pattern that
allowed it to be sensed.</p>

<p>Demandred came as close to smiling as he ever did.
What fools they were who opposed the Great Lord. Oh, the Bore was
still blocked, though more tenuously than when he had wakened from
his long sleep and broken free of his own prison in it. Blocked,
but larger than when he woke. Still not so large as when he had
been cast into it with his fellows at the end of the War of Power,
but at each visit since waking, a little wider. Soon the blockage
would be gone, and the Great Lord would reach out across the earth
again. Soon would come the Day of Return. And he would rule the
world for all time. Under the Great Lord, of course. And with those
of the other Chosen who survived, also of course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may leave now, Halfman.&rdquo; He did not want the
thing here to see the ecstasy overcome him. The ecstasy, and the
pain.</p>

<p>Shaidar Haran did not move.</p>

<p>Demandred opened his mouth&mdash;and a voice
exploded in his head.</p>

<p>DEMANDRED.</p>

<p>To call it a voice was to call a mountain a pebble.
It nearly crushed him against the inside of his own skull; it
filled him with rapture. He sank to his knees. The Myrddraal stood
watching impassively, but only a small part of him could even
notice the thing with that voice filling his brain.</p>

<p>DEMANDRED. HOW FARES THIS WORLD?</p>

<p>He was never sure how much the Great Lord knew of the
world. He had been as startled by ignorance as by knowledge. But he
had no doubt what the Great Lord wanted to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rahvin is dead, Great Lord. Yesterday.&rdquo; There was
pain. Euphoria too strong became pain quickly. His arms and legs
twitched. He was sweating, now. &ldquo;Lanfear has vanished without a
trace, just as Asmodean did. And Graendal says Moghedien failed to
meet her as they had agreed. Also yesterday, Great Lord. I do not
believe in coincidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>THE CHOSEN DWINDLE, DEMANDRED. THE WEAK FALL AWAY.
WHO BETRAYS ME SHALL DIE THE FINAL DEATH. ASMODEAN, TWISTED BY HIS
WEAKNESS. RAHVIN DEAD IN HIS PRIDE. HE SERVED WELL, YET EVEN I
CANNOT SAVE HIM FROM BALEFIRE. EVEN I CANNOT STEP OUTSIDE OF TIME.
For an instant terrible anger filled that awful voice, and&mdash;could it be frustration? An instant only. DONE BY MY ANCIENT ENEMY,
THE ONE CALLED DRAGON. WOULD YOU UNLEASH THE BALEFIRE IN MY
SERVICE, DEMANDRED?</p>

<p>Demandred hesitated. A bead of sweat slid half an
inch on his cheek; it seemed to take an hour. For a year during the
War of Power, both sides had used balefire. Until they learned the
consequences. Without agreement, or truce&mdash;there had never
been a truce any more than there had been quarter&mdash;each side
simply stopped. Entire cities died in balefire that year, hundreds
of thousands of threads burned from the Pattern; reality itself
almost unraveled, world and universe evaporating like mist. If
balefire was unleashed once more, there might be no world to
rule.</p>

<p>Another point pricked him. The Great Lord already
knew how Rahvin had died. And seemed to know more of Asmodean than
he. &ldquo;As you command, Great Lord, so shall I obey.&rdquo; His muscles
might be jerking, but his voice was rock steady. His knees began to
blister from the hot stone, yet the flesh might as well have been
someone else&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>SO YOU SHALL.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Lord, the Dragon can be destroyed.&rdquo; A dead man
could not wield balefire again, and perhaps then the Great Lord
would see no need for it. &ldquo;He is ignorant and weak, scattering his
attentions in a dozen directions. Rahvin was a vain fool. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>WOULD YOU BE NAE&rsquo;BLIS?</p>

<p>Demandred&rsquo;s tongue froze. Nae&rsquo;blis. The one
who would stand only a step below the Great Lord, commanding all
others. &ldquo;I wish only to serve you, Great Lord, however I may.&rdquo;
Nae&rsquo;blis.</p>

<p>THEN LISTEN, AND SERVE. HEAR WHO WILL DIE AND WHO
LIVE.</p>

<p>Demandred screamed as the voice crashed home. Tears
of joy rolled down his face.</p>

<p>Unmoving, the Myrddraal watched him.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop"> &ldquo;Stop fidgeting.&rdquo; Nynaeve testily flipped her long
braid over her shoulder. &ldquo;This won&rsquo;t work if you twitch around
like children with an itch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neither of the women across the rickety table
appeared any older than she, though they were by twenty years or
more, and neither was really fidgeting, but the heat had Nynaeve on
edge. The small windowless room seemed airless. She dripped sweat;
they appeared cool and dry. Leane, in a Domani dress of too-thin
blue silk, merely shrugged; the tall coppery-skinned woman
possessed an apparently infinite store of patience. Usually. Siuan,
fair and sturdy, seldom had any.</p>

<p>Now Siuan grunted and resettled her skirts irritably;
she used to wear fairly plain clothes, but this morning she was in
fine yellow linen embroidered with a Tairen maze around a neckline
that barely missed being too low. Her blue eyes were cold as deep
well water. As cold as deep well water would have been if the
weather had not gone mad. Her dresses might have changed, but not
her eyes. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t work in any case,&rdquo; she snapped. Her manner
of speaking was the same, too. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t patch a hull when
the whole boat&rsquo;s burned. Well, it&rsquo;s a waste of time, but
I promised, so get on with it. Leane and I have work to do.&rdquo; The
pair of them ran the networks of eyes-and-ears for the Aes Sedai
here in Salidar, the agents who sent in reports and rumors of what
was going on in the world.</p>

<p>Nynaeve smoothed her own skirts to soothe herself.
Her dress was plain white wool, with seven bands of color at the
hem, one for each Ajah. An Accepted&rsquo;s dress. It annoyed her
more than she could ever have imagined. She would much rather have
been in the green silk she had packed away. She was willing to
admit her acquired taste for fine clothes, privately at least, but
her choice of that particular dress was only for comfort&mdash;it
was thin, light&mdash;not because green seemed one of Lan&rsquo;s
favorite colors. Not at all. Idle dreaming of the worst sort. An
Accepted who put on anything except the banded white would soon
learn she was a <em>long</em> step below Aes Sedai. Firmly she put
all that out of her head. She was not here to fret over fripperies.
He liked blue, too. No!</p>

<p>Delicately she probed with the One Power, first at
Siuan, then Leane. In a manner of speaking, she was not channeling
at all. She could not channel a scrap unless angry, could not even
sense the True Source. Yet it came to the same thing. Fine
filaments of <em>saidar</em>, the female half of the True Source,
sifted through the two women at her weaving. They just did not
originate with her.</p>

<p>On her left wrist Nynaeve wore a slender bracelet, a
simple segmented silver band. Mainly silver, anyway, and from a
special source, though that made no difference. It was the only
piece of jewelry she wore aside from the Great Serpent ring;
Accepted were firmly discouraged from wearing much jewelry. A
matching necklace snugged around the neck of the fourth woman, on a
stool against the rough-plastered wall with her hands folded in her
lap. Clad in a farmer&rsquo;s rough brown wool, with a farmer&rsquo;s
worn sturdy face, she did not sweat a drop. She did not move a
muscle either, but her dark eyes watched everything. To Nynaeve,
the radiance of <em>saidar</em> surrounded her, but it was Nynaeve
who directed the channeling. Bracelet and necklace created a link
between them, much in the way Aes Sedai could link to combine their
power. Something about &ldquo;absolutely identical matrices&rdquo; was
involved, according to Elayne, after which the explanation truly
became incomprehensible. In truth, Nynaeve did not think Elayne
understood half as much as she pretended. For herself, Nynaeve did
not understand at all, except that she could feel the other
woman&rsquo;s every emotion, feel the woman herself, but tucked away
in a corner of her head, and that all the other woman&rsquo;s grasp
of <em>saidar</em> was in her control. Sometimes she thought it
would have been better if the woman on the stool were dead.
Simpler, certainly. Cleaner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;something torn, or cut,&rdquo; Nynaeve
muttered, wiping absently at the sweat on her face. It was just a
vague impression, barely there at all, but it was also the first
time she had sensed more than emptiness. It could be imagination,
and the desperate wanting to find something, anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Severing,&rdquo; the woman on the stool said. &ldquo;That was
what it was called, what you name stilling for women and gentling
for men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three heads swiveled toward her; three sets of eyes
glared with fury. Siuan and Leane had been Aes Sedai until they
were stilled during the coup in the White Tower that put Elaida on
the Amyrlin Seat. Stilled. A word to cause shudders. Never to
channel again. But always to remember, and know the loss. Always to
sense the True Source and know you could never touch it again.
Stilling could not be Healed any more than death.</p>

<p>That was what everyone believed, anyway, but in
Nynaeve&rsquo;s opinion the One Power should be able to Heal
anything short of death. &ldquo;If you have something useful to add,
Marigan,&rdquo; she said sharply, &ldquo;then say it. If not, keep quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marigan shrank back against the wall, eyes glittering
and fixed on Nynaeve. Fear and hate rolled through the bracelet,
but they always did to one degree or another. Captives seldom loved
their captors, even&mdash;perhaps especially&mdash;when they knew
they deserved captivity and worse. The problem was that Marigan
also said severing&mdash;stilling&mdash;could not be Healed. Oh,
she was full of claims that anything else except death could be
Healed in the Age of Legends, that what the Yellow Ajah called
Healing now was only the crudest hasty battlefield work. But try to
pin her down on specifics, on even a hint of how, and you found
nothing there. Marigan knew as much about Healing as Nynaeve did
about blacksmithing, which was that you stuck metal in hot coals
and hit it with a hammer. Certainly not enough to make a horseshoe.
Or Heal much beyond a bruise.</p>

<p>Twisting around in her chair, Nynaeve studied Siuan
and Leane. Days of this, whenever she could pry them away from
their other work, and so far she had learned nothing. Suddenly she
realized she was turning the bracelet on her wrist. Whatever the
gain, she hated being linked to the woman. The intimacy made her
skin crawl. <em>At least I might learn something</em>, she thought.
<em>And it couldn&rsquo;t fail any worse than everything else
has</em>.</p>

<p>Carefully she undid the bracelet&mdash;the clasp was
impossible to find unless you knew how&mdash;and handed it to
Siuan. &ldquo;Put this on.&rdquo; Losing the Power was bitter, but this had to
be done. And losing the waves of emotion was like taking a bath.
Marigan&rsquo;s eyes followed the narrow length of silver as if
hypnotized.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Siuan demanded. &ldquo;You tell me this thing only
works&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just put it on, Siuan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan eyed her stubbornly for a moment&mdash;Light,
but the woman could be obstinate!&mdash;before closing the
bracelet around her wrist. A look of wonder came onto her face
immediately, then her eyes narrowed at Marigan. &ldquo;She hates us, but
I knew that. And there&rsquo;s fear, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;shock. Not a glimmer
on her face, but she&rsquo;s shocked to her toes. I don&rsquo;t think
she believed I could use this thing, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marigan shifted uneasily. So far only two who knew
about her could use the bracelet. Four would give more chances for
questions. On the surface she seemed to be cooperating fully, but
how much was she hiding? As much as she could, Nynaeve was
sure.</p>

<p>With a sigh, Siuan shook her head. &ldquo;And I cannot. I
should be able to touch the Source through her, isn&rsquo;t that
right? Well, I can&rsquo;t. A grunter could climb trees first.
I&rsquo;ve been stilled, and that is that. How do you get this thing
off?&rdquo; She fumbled at the bracelet. &ldquo;How do you bloody get it
off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gently Nynaeve laid a hand over Siuan&rsquo;s on the
bracelet. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see? The bracelet won&rsquo;t work for a
woman who can&rsquo;t channel any more than the necklace would work
on her. If I put either on one of the cooks, it would be no more
than a pretty piece for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cooks or no cooks,&rdquo; Siuan said flatly, &ldquo;I cannot
channel. I have been stilled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there is something there to be Healed,&rdquo; Nynaeve
insisted, &ldquo;or you&rsquo;d feel nothing through the bracelet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan jerked her arm free and stuck her wrist out.
 &ldquo;Take it off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shaking her head, Nynaeve complied. Sometimes Siuan
could be as bullheaded as any man!</p>

<p>When she held the bracelet toward Leane, the Domani
woman lifted her wrist eagerly. Leane pretended to be as sanguine
over having been stilled as Siuan was&mdash;as Siuan pretended to
be&mdash;but she did not always succeed. Supposedly, the only way
to survive stilling for long was to find something else to fill
your life, to fill the hole left by the One Power. For Siuan and
Leane that something was running their networks of agents, and more
importantly, trying to convince the Aes Sedai here in Salidar to
support Rand al&rsquo;Thor as the Dragon Reborn without letting any
of the Aes Sedai know what they were doing. The question was
whether that was enough. The bitterness on Siuan&rsquo;s face, and
the delight on Leane&rsquo;s as the bracelet snapped shut, said that
maybe nothing could ever be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo; Leane had a brisk, clipped way of
speaking. Except when talking to men, anyway; she was Domani, after
all, and of late making up for time lost in the Tower. &ldquo;Yes, she
really is stunned, isn&rsquo;t she? Beginning to control it now,
though.&rdquo; For a few moments she sat silently, considering the woman
on the stool. Marigan stared back warily. At last, Leane shrugged.
 &ldquo;I cannot touch the Source, either. And I tried to make her feel a
fleabite on her ankle. If it had worked, she would have had to show
something.&rdquo; That was the other trick of the bracelet; you could
make the woman wearing the necklace feel physical sensations. Only
the sensations&mdash;there was no mark whatever you did, no real
damage&mdash;but the feel of a sound switching or two had sufficed
to convince Marigan that cooperation was her best choice. That and
the alternative, a quick trial followed by execution.</p>

<p>Despite her failure, Leane watched closely as Nynaeve
undid the bracelet and refastened it on her own wrist. It seemed
that she, at least, had not given up completely on channeling again
one day.</p>

<p>Regaining the Power was wonderful. Not as wonderful
as drawing <em>saidar</em> herself, being filled with it, but even
touching the Source through the other woman was like redoubling the
life in her veins. To hold <em>saidar</em> inside was to want to
laugh and dance with pure joy. She supposed that one day she would
become used to it; full Aes Sedai must. Balanced against that,
linking with Marigan was a small price. &ldquo;Now that we know
there&rsquo;s a chance,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door banged open, and Nynaeve was on her feet
before she knew it. She never thought of using the Power; she would
have screamed if her throat had not closed tight. She was not the
only one, but she hardly noticed Siuan and Leane leaping up. The
fear cascading through the bracelet seemed an echo of her own.</p>

<p>The young woman who shut the splintery wooden door
behind her took no notice of the commotion she had caused. Tall and
straight in an Accepted&rsquo;s banded white dress, with sun-gold
curls nestled on her shoulders, she looked spitting mad. Even with
her face tight with anger and dripping sweat she somehow managed to
look beautiful, though; it was a knack Elayne had. &ldquo;Do you know
what they&rsquo;re doing? They are sending an embassy to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to
Caemlyn! And they refuse to let me go! Sheriam <em>forbade</em> me
to mention it again. Forbade me even to <em>speak</em> of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you never learn to knock, Elayne?&rdquo; Straightening
her chair, Nynaeve sat down again. Fell, really; relief weakened
her knees. &ldquo;I thought you <em>were</em> Sheriam.&rdquo; Just the thought
of discovery cored out her middle.</p>

<p>To her credit, Elayne blushed and apologized
immediately. Then spoiled it by adding, &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see why
you were so goosey. Birgitte is still outside, and you
<em>know</em> she would warn you if anyone else came close.
Nynaeve, they <em>must</em> let me go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They <em>must</em> do nothing of the kind,&rdquo; Siuan
said gruffly. She and Leane were seated again, too. Siuan sat up
straight, as always, but Leane sagged back, as flimsy as
Nynaeve&rsquo;s knees. Marigan was leaning against the wall,
breathing hard, eyes closed and hands pressed hard against the
plaster. Relief and stark terror surged through the bracelet in
alternating jolts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan did not allow Elayne another word. &ldquo;Do you
think Sheriam, or any of the others, will let the Daughter-Heir of
Andor fall into the hands of the Dragon Reborn? With your mother
dead&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that!&rdquo; Elayne snapped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe Rand killed her,&rdquo; Siuan went
on relentlessly, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s a different thing. I don&rsquo;t,
either. But if Morgase were alive, she would come forward and
acknowledge him the Dragon Reborn. Or, if she believed him a false
Dragon in spite of the proof, she&rsquo;d be organizing resistance.
None of my eyes-and-ears have heard a whisper of either. Not just
in Andor, but not here in Altara and not in Murandy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They <em>have</em>,&rdquo; Elayne forced in. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
rebellion in the west.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Against Morgase. Against. If it&rsquo;s not a rumor,
too.&rdquo; Siuan&rsquo;s voice was flat as a planed board. &ldquo;Your mother
is dead, girl. Best to admit as much and get your weeping
done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s chin rose, a very annoying habit she
had; she was the picture of icy arrogance, though most men seemed
to find it attractive for some reason. &ldquo;You complain continually
over how long it is taking to get in touch with all of your
agents,&rdquo; she said coolly, &ldquo;but I will set aside whether you can
have heard all there is to hear. Whether my mother is alive or not,
my place is in Caemlyn, now. I <em>am</em> Daughter-Heir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siuan&rsquo;s loud snort made Nynaeve jump.
 &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been Accepted long enough to know better.&rdquo; Elayne had
as much potential as had been seen in a thousand years. Not as much
as Nynaeve, if she ever learned to channel at will, but still
enough to make any Aes Sedai&rsquo;s eyes light up. Elayne&rsquo;s
nose wrinkled&mdash;she knew very well that if she had already
been on the Lion Throne, the Aes Sedai still would have gotten her
away for training, by asking if possible, by stuffing her into a
barrel if necessary&mdash;and she opened her mouth, but Siuan did
not even slow down. &ldquo;True, they&rsquo;d not mind you taking the
throne sooner than later; there hasn&rsquo;t been a Queen who was
openly Aes Sedai in far too long. But they won&rsquo;t let you go
until you&rsquo;re a full sister, and even then, because you
<em>are</em> Daughter-Heir and will be Queen soon, they won&rsquo;t
let you near the Dragon bloody Reborn until they know how far they
can trust him. Especially since this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>amnesty</em> of
his.&rdquo; Her mouth twisted sourly around the word, and Leane
grimaced.</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s tongue curdled, too. She had been
brought up to fear any man who could channel, fated to go mad and,
before the Shadow-tainted male half of the Source killed him
horribly, bring terror to everyone around him. But Rand, whom she
had watched grow up, was the Dragon Reborn, born both as a sign
that the Last Battle was coming and to fight the Dark One in that
battle. The Dragon Reborn; humanity&rsquo;s only hope&mdash;and a
man who could channel. Worse, reports were that he was trying to
gather others like him. Of course, there could not be many. Any Aes
Sedai would hunt down one of those&mdash;the Red Ajah did little
else&mdash;but they found few, far fewer than once, according to
the records.</p>

<p>Elayne was not about to give up, though. That was one
admirable thing about her; she would not give up if her head were
on the block and the axe descending. She stood there with her chin
up, facing Siuan&rsquo;s stare, which Nynaeve often found hard to
do. &ldquo;There are two clear reasons why I should go. First, whatever
has happened to my mother, she <em>is</em> missing, and as
Daughter-Heir, I can calm the people and assure them the succession
is intact. Second, I can approach Rand. He trusts me. I would be
<em>far</em> better than anyone the Hall chooses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai here in Salidar had chosen their own
Hall of the Tower, a Hall-in-exile, as it were. They were supposed
to be mulling over the choice of a new Amyrlin Seat, a rightful
Amyrlin to challenge Elaida&rsquo;s claim to the title and the
Tower, but Nynaeve had not seen much sign of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So kind of you to sacrifice yourself, child,&rdquo; Leane
said dryly. Elayne&rsquo;s expression did not change, yet she
colored furiously; few outside this room knew, and no Aes Sedai,
but Nynaeve had no doubt that Elayne&rsquo;s first act in Caemlyn
would be to get Rand alone and kiss him within an inch of his life.
 &ldquo;With your mother&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;missing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;if Rand al&rsquo;Thor has you,
and Caemlyn, he has Andor, and the Hall won&rsquo;t let him have any
more of Andor than they have to, or anywhere else if they can help
it. He carries Tear and Cairhien in his pocket, and the Aiel as
well, it seems. Add Andor, and Murandy and Altara&mdash;with us in
it&mdash;fall if he sneezes. He is growing too powerful, too fast.
He might decide he doesn&rsquo;t need us. With Moiraine dead,
there&rsquo;s no one near him we can trust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That made Nynaeve wince. Moiraine was the Aes Sedai
who had brought her and Rand out of the Two Rivers and changed
their lives. Her and Rand and Egwene and Mat and Perrin. She had
wanted for so long to make Moiraine pay for what she had done to
them that losing her was like losing a piece of herself. But
Moiraine was dead in Cairhien, taking Lanfear with her; she was
fast becoming a legend among the Aes Sedai here, the only Aes Sedai
to have killed one of the Forsaken, much less two. The only good
thing Nynaeve could find in it, much as it shamed to find any good,
was that now Lan was freed from being Moiraine&rsquo;s Warder. If
she could ever find him.</p>

<p>Siuan took up immediately where Leane left off. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t afford to let the boy go sailing off with no guidance at
all. Who knows what he might do? Yes, yes, I know you&rsquo;re ready
to argue for him, but I don&rsquo;t care to hear it. I&rsquo;m trying
to balance a live silverpike on my nose, girl. We can&rsquo;t let
him grow too strong before he accepts us, and yet we don&rsquo;t
dare hold him back too much. And I&rsquo;m trying to keep Sheriam
and the others convinced they <em>should</em> support him when half
the Hall secretly don&rsquo;t want anything to do with him, and the
other half think in their heart of hearts that he should be
gentled, Dragon Reborn or not. In any case, whatever your
arguments, I suggest you heed Sheriam. You won&rsquo;t change any
minds, and Tiana doesn&rsquo;t have enough novices here to keep her
busy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne&rsquo;s face tightened angrily. Tiana Noselle,
a Gray sister, was Mistress of Novices here in Salidar. An Accepted
had to step considerably further out of line to be sent to Tiana
than did a novice, but by the same token, the visit was always that
much more shaming and painful. Tiana might show a little kindness
to a novice, if only a little; she felt Accepted should know
better, and made sure they felt the same long before they left her
small cubbyhole of a study.</p>

<p>Nynaeve had been studying Siuan, and now something
popped into her head. &ldquo;You knew all about this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;embassy, or
whatever it is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t you? You two always have your
heads together with Sheriam and her little circle.&rdquo; The Hall might
have all the supposed authority until they chose an Amyrlin, but
Sheriam and the handful of other Aes Sedai who had first organized
the arrivals in Salidar still kept the real control of things. &ldquo;How
many are they sending, Siuan?&rdquo; Elayne gasped; plainly she had not
thought of this. That showed how upset she was. Usually she caught
nuances Nynaeve missed.</p>

<p>Siuan denied nothing. Since being stilled she could
lie like a wool merchant, but when she decided to be open, she was
as open as a slap in the face. &ldquo;Nine. &#145;Enough to do honor to
the Dragon Reborn&rsquo;&mdash;fish guts! An embassy to a
<em>king</em> is seldom more than three!&mdash;&#145;but not
enough to frighten him.&rsquo; If he&rsquo;s learned enough to be
frightened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better hope he has,&rdquo; Elayne said coldly. &ldquo;If
he hasn&rsquo;t, then nine may be eight too many.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thirteen was the dangerous number. Rand was strong,
perhaps as strong as any man since the Breaking, but thirteen Aes
Sedai linked could overwhelm him, shield him from <em>saidin</em>,
and take him prisoner. Thirteen was the number assigned when a man
was gentled, though Nynaeve had begun to think the assignment more
custom than requirement. Aes Sedai did a good many things because
they always had.</p>

<p>Siuan&rsquo;s smile was far from pleasant. &ldquo;I wonder
why no one else thought of that? Think, girl! Sheriam does, and so
does the Hall. Only one will go near him at first, and no more
after that than he&rsquo;s comfortable with. But he&rsquo;ll know
nine came, and somebody will certainly tell him what an honor that
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Elayne said in a small voice. &ldquo;I should have
known one of you would think of it. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; That was
another good thing about her. She could be stubborn as a cross-eyed
mule, but when she decided she was wrong, she admitted it as nicely
as any village woman. Most unusual for a noble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Min will be going too,&rdquo; Leane said. &ldquo;Her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;talents may be useful to Rand. The sisters won&rsquo;t know that
part, of course. She can keep her secrets.&rdquo; As if that were the
important thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Elayne said again, flatly this time. She
made an effort to brighten her tone, a miserable failure. &ldquo;Well, I
see you&rsquo;re busy with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;with Marigan. I did not mean to
disturb you. Please, don&rsquo;t let me interrupt.&rdquo; She was gone
before Nynaeve could open her mouth, the door banging shut behind
her.</p>

<p>Angrily, Nynaeve rounded on Leane. &ldquo;I thought Siuan
was the mean one of you, but that was vicious!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Siuan who answered. &ldquo;When two women love the
same man, it means trouble, and when the man is Rand al&rsquo;Thor&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Light knows how sane he still is. Or what course they might
send him off on. If there&rsquo;s any hair-pulling and clawing to be
done, let them do it now, here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without thought, Nynaeve&rsquo;s hand found her braid
and jerked it back over her shoulder. &ldquo;I ought to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Trouble
was, there was little she could do, and nothing to make any
difference. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go on from where we left off when Elayne
came in. But, Siuan&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;if you ever do something like that to her
again,&rdquo; <em>or to me</em>, she thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you sorry
you&mdash;where do you think you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo; Siuan had scraped
back her chair and risen, and after a glance, Leane did the
same.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have work,&rdquo; Siuan said curtly, already heading
for the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You promised to make yourself available, Siuan.
Sheriam told you to.&rdquo; Not that Sheriam thought it any less a waste
of time than Siuan, but Nynaeve and Elayne had earned rewards, and
a certain amount of indulgence. Like Marigan to be their maid, to
give them more time for Accepted&rsquo;s studies.</p>

<p>Siuan gave her an amused look from the door. &ldquo;Maybe
you&rsquo;ll complain to her? And explain how you do your research?
I want time with <em>Marigan</em> this evening; I have some more
questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Siuan left, Leane said sadly, &ldquo;It would be nice,
Nynaeve, but we have to do what we <em>can</em> do. You could try
Logain.&rdquo; Then she was gone, too.</p>

<p>Nynaeve scowled. Studying Logain had taught her even
less than studying the two women. She was no longer certain she
could learn anything from him at all. Anyway, the last thing she
wanted was to Heal a gentled man. He made her nervous in any
case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bite at one another like rats in a sealed box,&rdquo;
Marigan said. &ldquo;On the evidence, your chances are not very good.
Perhaps you should consider&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;other options.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your filthy tongue!&rdquo; Nynaeve glared at her.
 &ldquo;Hold it, the Light burn you!&rdquo; Fear still oozed through the
bracelet, but something else as well, something almost too feeble
to exist. A faint spark of hope, perhaps. &ldquo;The Light burn you,&rdquo; she
muttered.</p>

<p>The woman&rsquo;s real name was not Marigan, but
Moghedien. One of the Forsaken, trapped with her own overweening
pride and held prisoner in the midst of Aes Sedai. Only five women
in the world knew, none Aes Sedai, but keeping Moghedien secret was
purest necessity. The Forsaken&rsquo;s crimes made her execution as
sure as the sun rising. Siuan agreed; for every Aes Sedai who
counseled waiting, if any did, ten would demand immediate justice.
Into an unmarked grave with her would go all her knowledge from the
Age of Legends, when things undreamed of today were done with the
Power. Nynaeve was not sure she believed half of what the woman
told her of that Age. She certainly understood less than half.</p>

<p>Digging information out of Moghedien was not easy.
Sometimes it was like Healing; Moghedien had never been interested
in much that could not advance her, preferably by shortcuts. The
woman was hardly likely to reveal the truth, but Nynaeve suspected
she had been some sort of swindler or the like before swearing her
soul over to the Dark One. Sometimes she and Elayne just did not
know the questions to ask. Moghedien seldom volunteered anything,
that was certain. Even so, they had learned a great deal, and
passed most on to the Aes Sedai. As results of their researches and
studies as Accepted, of course. They had gained a lot of
credit.</p>

<p>She and Elayne would have kept knowledge of her to
themselves if they could, but Birgitte had known from the start,
and Siuan and Leane had to be told. Siuan had known enough of the
circumstances that led to Moghedien&rsquo;s capture to demand a full
explanation, and had the leverage to obtain one. Nynaeve and Elayne
knew some of Siuan and Leane&rsquo;s secrets; they seemed to know
all of her and Elayne&rsquo;s except the truth about Birgitte. It
made for a precarious balance, with the advantage to Siuan and
Leane. Besides, bits of Moghedien&rsquo;s revelations concerned
supposed Darkfriend plots and hints of what the other Forsaken
might be up to. The only way to pass those on was to make them seem
to have come from Siuan and Leane&rsquo;s agents. Nothing about the
Black Ajah&mdash;hidden deep and long denied&mdash;though that
interested Siuan most. Darkfriends disgusted her, but the very idea
of Aes Sedai swearing themselves to the Dark One was enough to
screw Siuan&rsquo;s anger to an icy rage. Moghedien claimed to have
been afraid to go near <em>any</em> Aes Sedai, and that was
believable enough. Fear was a permanent part of the woman. No
wonder she had hidden in the shadows enough to be called the
Spider. All in all, she was a treasure trove too valuable to give
to the headsman, yet most Aes Sedai would not see it so. Most Aes
Sedai might refuse to touch or trust anything learned from her.</p>

<p>Guilt and revulsion stabbed Nynaeve, not for the
first time. Could any amount of knowledge justify keeping one of
the Forsaken from justice? Turning her in meant punishment,
probably dreadful, for everyone involved, not just herself, but
Elayne and Siuan and Leane. Turning her in meant Birgitte&rsquo;s
secret would come out. And all that knowledge lost. Moghedien might
know nothing of Healing, but she had given Nynaeve a dozen hints of
what was possible, and there had to be more in her head. With those
to guide her, what might she discover eventually?</p>

<p>Nynaeve wanted a bath, and it had nothing to do with
the heat. &ldquo;We will talk about the weather,&rdquo; she said bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know more about controlling weather than I do.&rdquo;
Moghedien sounded weary, and an echo slid through the bracelet.
There had been enough questions on the subject. &ldquo;All I know is that
what is happening is the Great&mdash;the Dark One&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;
She had the nerve to smile ingratiatingly at the slip. &ldquo;No mere
human is strong enough to change that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took effort for Nynaeve not to grind her teeth.
Elayne knew more about working weather than anyone else in Salidar,
and she said the same. Including the Dark One part, though any but
a fool would know that, with the heat so strong when it should be
coming on for snow, with no rain and the streams drying. &ldquo;Then
we&rsquo;ll talk about using different weaves to Heal different
illnesses.&rdquo; The woman said that took more time than what was done
now, but all the strength for it came from the Power, not from the
patient and the woman channeling. Of course, she said <em>men</em>
had actually been better at some kinds of Healing, and Nynaeve was
not about to believe that. &ldquo;You must have seen it done at least
once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She settled down to bore away for nuggets in the
dross. Some knowledge was worth a great deal. She just wished she
did not feel that she was digging through slime.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Elayne did not hesitate once she was outside, only
waved to Birgitte and went on. Birgitte, her golden hair in an
intricate waist-long braid, was playing with two small boys while
she kept watch in the narrow alley, her bow propped against a
leaning fence beside her. Or trying to play with them. Jaril and
Seve stared at the woman in her odd wide yellow trousers and short
dark coat, but they showed no more reaction than that. They never
did, and they never spoke. They were supposed to be
 &ldquo;Marigan&rsquo;s&rdquo; children. Birgitte was happy playing with them,
and a touch sad; she always liked playing with children, especially
little boys, and she always felt that way when she did. Elayne knew
it as well as she knew her own feelings.</p>

<p>If she had thought Moghedien had anything to do with
their condition&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but the woman claimed they were as they had
been when she picked them up for her disguise in Ghealdan, orphans
in the street, and some of the Yellow sisters said they had simply
seen too much in the riots in Samara. Elayne could believe it from
what she herself had encountered there. The Yellow sisters said
time and care would help them; Elayne hoped it was so. She hoped
she was not allowing the one responsible to escape justice.</p>

<p>She did not want to think about Moghedien now. Her
mother. No, she definitely did not want to think about her. Min.
And Rand. There had to be some way to handle this. Barely seeing
Birgitte&rsquo;s return nod, she hurried up the alley and out onto
the main street of Salidar beneath a cloudless, broiling midday
sky.</p>

<p>For years Salidar had stood abandoned, before Aes
Sedai fleeing Elaida&rsquo;s coup began to gather there, but now
fresh thatch topped the houses, most of which showed considerable
new repairs and patches, and the three large stone buildings that
had been inns. One, the largest, was called the Little Tower by
some; that was where the Hall met. Only what was necessary had been
done, of course; cracked glass filled many windows, or none. More
important matters were afoot than repointing stonework or painting.
The dirt streets were filled to bursting. Not just with Aes Sedai,
of course, but Accepted in banded dresses and scurrying novices in
pure white, Warders moving with the deadly grace of leopards
whether lean or bulky, servants who had followed Aes Sedai from the
Tower, even a few children. And soldiers.</p>

<p>The Hall here was preparing to enforce its claims
against Elaida by arms if necessary, just as soon as they chose a
true Amyrlin Seat. The distant clang of hammers, cutting through
the crowds&rsquo; murmur from forges outside the village, spoke of
horses being shod, armor being mended. A square-faced man, his dark
hair heavy with gray, went riding slowly down the street in a
buff-colored coat and battered breastplate. Picking his way through
the crowd, he eyed marching clusters of men with long pikes on
their shoulders, or bows. Gareth Bryne had agreed to recruit and
lead the Salidar Hall&rsquo;s army, though Elayne wished she knew
the full how and why. Something to do with Siuan and Leane, though
what, she could not imagine, since he ran both women ragged,
especially Siuan, fulfilling some oath Elayne did not have the
straight of either. Just that Siuan complained bitterly about
having to keep his room and his clothes clean on top of her other
duties. She complained, but she did it; it must have been a strong
oath.</p>

<p>Bryne&rsquo;s eyes passed across Elayne with barely a
hesitation. He had been coolly polite and distant since she arrived
in Salidar, though she had known him since her cradle. Until less
than a year ago he had been Captain-General of the Queen&rsquo;s
Guards, in Andor. Once, Elayne had thought he and her mother would
marry. No, she was not going to think of her mother! Min. She had
to find Min and talk.</p>

<p>No sooner had she begun to weave through the crowded
dusty street, though, than two Aes Sedai found her. There was no
choice but to stop and curtsy, while the throng streamed around
them. Both women beamed. Neither sweated a drop. Pulling a
handkerchief from her sleeve to dab at her face, Elayne wished she
had already been taught that particular bit of Aes Sedai lore.
 &ldquo;Good day, Anaiya Sedai, Janya Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, child. Do you have any more discoveries
for us today?&rdquo; As usual, Janya Frende spoke as though there was no
time to get the words out. &ldquo;Such remarkable strides you&rsquo;ve
made, you and Nynaeve, especially for Accepted. I still don&rsquo;t
see how Nynaeve does it, when she has so many difficulties with the
Power, but I must say I&rsquo;m delighted.&rdquo; Unlike most Brown
sisters, often absentminded beyond their books and studies, Janya
Sedai was quite neat, every short dark hair tidy around the ageless
face that marked Aes Sedai who had worked long with the Power. But
the slender woman&rsquo;s appearance did hint at her Ajah. Her dress
was plain gray, and stout wool&mdash;Browns seldom thought of
clothes as more than decent covering&mdash;and even when she was
talking to you, she wore a little frown, as though squinting in
thought about something else entirely. She would have been pretty
without that frown. &ldquo;That way of wrapping yourself in light to
become invisible. Remarkable. I&rsquo;m sure someone will find how
to stop the ripples, so you can move about with it. And Carenna is
quite excited over that little eavesdropping trick of
Nynaeve&rsquo;s. Naughty of her, to think of that, but useful.
Carenna thinks she sees how to adapt it to <em>talk</em> to someone
at a distance. Think of it. To talk with someone a mile away! Or
two, or even&mdash;&rdquo; Anaiya touched her arm, and she cut off,
blinking at the other Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are making great strides, Elayne,&rdquo; Anaiya said
calmly. The bluff-faced woman was always calm. &ldquo;Motherly&rdquo; was the
word to describe her, and comforting usually, though Aes Sedai
features made putting an age to her impossible. She was also one of
the small circle around Sheriam who held the real power in Salidar.
 &ldquo;Greater than any of us expected, truly, and we expected much. The
first to make a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> since the Breaking. That
is remarkable, child, and I want you to know that. You should be
very proud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elayne stared at the ground in front of her toes. Two
waist-high boys went dodging by through the crowd, laughing. She
wished no one were close enough to hear this. Not that any of the
passersby gave them a second glance. With so many Aes Sedai in the
village, not even novices curtsied unless an Aes Sedai addressed
them, and everyone had errands that needed to be done
yesterday.</p>

<p>She did not feel proud at all. Not with all of their
 &ldquo;discoveries&rdquo; coming from Moghedien. There had been a good many,
beginning with &ldquo;inverting,&rdquo; so a weave could not be seen by any but
the woman who had woven it, yet they had not passed everything on.
How to hide your ability to channel, for one. Without that,
Moghedien would have been unmasked in hours&mdash;any Aes Sedai
within two or three paces of a woman could sense whether she could
channel&mdash;and if they learned how to do that, they might learn
how to penetrate it. And how to disguise yourself; inverted weaves
made &ldquo;Marigan&rdquo; look nothing at all like Moghedien.</p>

<p>Some of what the woman knew was just too repulsive.
Compulsion, for instance, bending people&rsquo;s will, and a way to
implant instructions so the recipient would not even remember the
orders when he carried them out. Worse things. Too repulsive, and
maybe too dangerous to trust anyone with. Nynaeve said they had to
learn them in order to learn how to counter them, but Elayne did
not want to. They were keeping so many secrets, telling so many
lies to friends and people on their side, that she almost wished
she could take the Three Oaths on the Oath Rod without waiting to
be raised Aes Sedai. One of those bound you to speak no word that
was not true, bound you as though a part of your flesh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done as well as I might with the
<em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>, Anaiya Sedai.&rdquo; That, at least, was hers
and hers alone. The first had been the bracelet and necklace&mdash;a fact kept well hidden, needless to say&mdash;but they were an
altered copy of a nasty invention, the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>, that
the Seanchan left behind when their invasion was driven into the
sea at Falme. The plain green disc that allowed someone not strong
enough to work the invisibility trick&mdash;not many were&mdash;had been her idea from the first. She had no <em>angreal</em> or
<em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> to study, so they had been impossible to
make so far, and even after her ease in copying the Seanchan
device, <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> had not proven as easy as she had
thought. They used the One Power instead of magnifying it, used it
for one specific purpose, to do one thing. Some could even be used
by people who could not channel, even men. They should have been
simpler. Maybe they were, in function, but not simple to make.</p>

<p>Her modest statement unleashed a torrent from Janya.
 &ldquo;Nonsense, child. Absolute nonsense. Why, I&rsquo;ve no doubt that
as soon as we are back in the Tower and can test you properly and
put the Oath Rod in your hand, you&rsquo;ll be raised to the shawl
as well as the ring. No doubt. You really are fulfilling all the
promise that was seen in you. And more. No one could have expected&mdash;&rdquo; Anaiya touched her arm again; it seemed a set signal,
because once more Janya stopped and blinked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need to swell the child&rsquo;s head too far,&rdquo;
Anaiya said. &ldquo;Elayne, I&rsquo;ll have no sulking out of you. You
should have outgrown that long since.&rdquo; The mother could be firm as
well as kindly. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have you pouting over a few failures,
not when your success was so wonderful.&rdquo; Elayne had made five tries
at the stone disc. Two did nothing, and two made you appear blurry,
as well as sick to your stomach. The one that worked had been the
third attempt. More than a few failures in Elayne&rsquo;s book.
 &ldquo;Everything you&rsquo;ve done is wonderful. You, and Nynaeve,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Elayne said. &ldquo;Thank you both. I&rsquo;ll
try not to be sulky.&rdquo; When an Aes Sedai said you were sulky, the
one thing you did not do was tell her you were not. &ldquo;Will you
excuse me, please? I understand the embassy to Caemlyn is leaving
today, and I want to say goodbye to Min.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They let her go, of course, though Janya might have
taken half an hour to do so without Anaiya there. Anaiya eyed
Elayne sharply&mdash;she surely knew all about the words with
Sheriam&mdash;but said nothing. Sometimes an Aes Sedai&rsquo;s
silences were as loud as words.</p>

<p>Thumbing the ring on the third finger of her left
hand, Elayne darted on at a near trot, eyes focused far enough
ahead that she could claim not to have seen anyone else who tried
to stop her for congratulations. It might work, and it might mean a
visit to Tiana; indulgences for good work only went so far. Right
that moment, she would much prefer Tiana to praise she did not
deserve.</p>

<p>The gold ring was a serpent biting its own tail, the
Great Serpent, a symbol of Aes Sedai, but worn by Accepted too.
When she donned the shawl, fringed in the color of the Ajah she
selected, she would wear it on the finger she chose. It would be
the Green Ajah for her, of necessity; only Green sisters had more
than one Warder, and she wanted to have Rand. Or as much of him as
she could, at least. The difficulty was that she had already bonded
Birgitte, the first woman ever to become a Warder. That was why she
could sense Birgitte&rsquo;s feelings, how she knew Birgitte had
gotten a splinter in her hand that morning. Only Nynaeve knew about
the bond. Warders were for full Aes Sedai; for an Accepted who
overstepped that bound, no indulgences in the world would save her
hide. For them it had been necessity, not whim&mdash;Birgitte
would have died, else&mdash;but Elayne did not think that would
make any difference. Breaking a rule with the Power could be fatal
for yourself and others; to set that firmly in your mind, Aes Sedai
seldom let anyone get away with breaking any rule for any
reason.</p>

<p>There was so much subterfuge here in Salidar. Not
just Birgitte, and Moghedien. One of the Oaths kept an Aes Sedai
from lying, but what was not spoken of did not have to be lied
over. Moiraine had known how to weave a cloak of invisibility,
maybe the same one they learned from Moghedien; Nynaeve had seen
Moiraine do it once, before Nynaeve knew anything of the Power. No
one else in Salidar had known, though. Or admitted to it, anyway.
Birgitte had confirmed what Elayne had begun to suspect. Most Aes
Sedai, maybe all, kept back at least part of what they learned;
most had their own secret tricks. Those might become common
knowledge taught to novices or Accepted, if enough Aes Sedai
learned them&mdash;or they might die with the Aes Sedai. Two or
three times she thought she had seen a glimmer in someone&rsquo;s
eyes when she demonstrated something. Carenna had leaped onto the
eavesdropping trick with suspicious quickness. But it was hardly
the sort of accusation an Accepted could make against Aes
Sedai.</p>

<p>Knowing did not make her own deceptions more
palatable, but maybe it helped a little. That and remembering
necessity. If only they would stop praising her for what she had
not done.</p>

<p>She was sure she knew where to find Min. The River
Eldar lay not three miles west of Salidar, and a tiny stream ran
through the edge of the village on its way through the forest to
the river. Most of the trees that had grown up in the town had been
cut down after Aes Sedai began arriving, but a small patch on the
stream&rsquo;s bank remained behind some houses, on a scrap of land
too narrow to be useful. Min claimed to like cities best, yet she
often went to sit among those trees. It was a way to escape the
company of Aes Sedai and Warders awhile, and for Min that was
almost essential.</p>

<p>Sure enough, when Elayne edged her way around the
corner of a stone house onto the slender strip, along a runnel of
water no wider, Min was sitting there with her back against a tree,
watching the little brook burble over rocks. As much as was left of
it; the stream trickled down a bed of dried mud twice as wide as it
was. The trees held a few leaves here, though most of the
surrounding forest was beginning to go bare. Even the oaks.</p>

<p>A dried branch cracked under Elayne&rsquo;s slipper,
and Min jumped to her feet. As usual she wore a boy&rsquo;s gray
coat and breeches, but she had had small blue flowers embroidered
on the lapels and up the sides of the snug legs. Oddly, since she
said the three aunts who raised her had been seamstresses, Min
seemed not to know one end of a needle from the other. She stared
at Elayne, then grimaced and ran her fingers through dark
shoulder-length hair. &ldquo;You know&rdquo; was all she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought we should talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min scrubbed her hands through her hair again. &ldquo;Siuan
didn&rsquo;t tell me until this morning. I&rsquo;ve been trying to
work up courage to tell you ever since. She wants me to spy on him,
Elayne. For the embassy, and she gave me names in Caemlyn, people
who can send messages back to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t do it, of course,&rdquo; Elayne said,
without a hint of question, and Min gave her a grateful look. &ldquo;Why
were you afraid to come to me? We are friends, Min. And we promised
each other not to let a man come between us. Even if we do both
love him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min&rsquo;s laugh had a huskiness to it; Elayne
supposed many men would find that attractive. And she was pretty,
in a mischievous sort of way. And a few years older; was that in
her favor, or against? &ldquo;Oh, Elayne, we said that when he was safely
away from both of us. Losing you would be like losing a sister, but
what if one of us changes her mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Best not to ask which of them that was supposed to
be. Elayne tried not to think of the fact that if she bound and
gagged Min with the Power and inverted the weave, she might be able
to hide the woman in a basement until the embassy was long gone.
 &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said simply. No, she could not do that to Min.
She wanted Rand all to herself, but she could not hurt Min. Maybe
she could just ask the other woman not to go until they both could.
Instead, she said, &ldquo;Is Gareth releasing you from your oath?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time Min&rsquo;s laugh was a bark. &ldquo;Hardly. He
says he&rsquo;ll make me work it off sooner or later. Siuan&rsquo;s
the one he really wants to hold on to, the Light knows why.&rdquo; A
slight tensing of her face made Elayne think there was a viewing
involved in it, but she did not ask. Min never talked about those
unless they concerned you.</p>

<p>She had an ability known to few in Salidar. Elayne
and Nynaeve, Siuan and Leane; that was all. Birgitte did not know,
but then Min did not know about Birgitte. Or Moghedien. So many
secrets. But Min&rsquo;s was her own. Sometimes she saw images or
auras around people, and sometimes she knew what they meant. When
she knew, she was always right; for instance, if she said a man and
woman would marry, then sooner or later they married, even if they
plainly hated one another now. Leane called it &ldquo;reading the
Pattern,&rdquo; but it had nothing to do with the Power. Most people
carried the images only occasionally, but Aes Sedai and Warders
always. Min&rsquo;s retreats here were to escape that deluge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you carry a letter to Rand for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; The other woman&rsquo;s assent was so
quick, her face so open, that Elayne blushed and went on hurriedly.
She was not sure she would have agreed had the circumstances been
reversed. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t let him know about your viewings, Min.
Concerning us, I mean.&rdquo; One thing Min had viewed about Rand was
that three women would fall hopelessly in love with him, be tied to
him forever, and that one of them would be herself. The second had
turned out to be Elayne. &ldquo;If he learns about the viewing, he might
decide it isn&rsquo;t what we want, only the Pattern, or his being
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>. He could decide to be noble and save us by
not letting either of us near him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Min said doubtfully. &ldquo;Men are strange. More
likely, if he realizes we&rsquo;ll both come running when he crooks
a finger, he&rsquo;ll crook it. He won&rsquo;t be able to help
himself. I&rsquo;ve seen them do it. I think it has something to do
with the hair on their chins.&rdquo; She had such a wondering look that
Elayne was not sure whether or not that was a joke. Min seemed to
know a lot about men; she had worked mainly in stables&mdash;she
liked horses&mdash;but once she had mentioned serving table in a
tavern. &ldquo;Either way, I won&rsquo;t tell. You and I will divide him
up like a pie. Maybe we&rsquo;ll let the third have a bit of crust
when she shows up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do, Min?&rdquo; Elayne had not meant
to say that, certainly not in a near wail. Part of her wanted to
say unequivocally that <em>she</em> would never come for a crooked
finger; part wanted him to crook it. Part of her wanted to say she
would not share Rand, not in any way, not with <em>anyone</em>,
even a friend, and Min&rsquo;s viewings could go to the Pit of Doom;
part wanted to box Rand&rsquo;s ears for doing this to her and Min.
It was all so childish she felt like hiding her head, but she could
not untangle the snarl in her feelings. Leveling her voice, she
answered her own question before Min could. &ldquo;What we&rsquo;re going
to do is sit here awhile and talk.&rdquo; She suited the words, choosing
a spot where the dead leaves were particularly thick. A tree made a
fine backrest. &ldquo;Only not about Rand. I am going to miss you, Min.
It&rsquo;s so good to have a friend I can trust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Min sat cross-legged beside her and idly began
digging up pebbles and tossing them into the stream. &ldquo;Nynaeve is
your friend. You trust her. And Birgitte certainly seems to be one;
you spend more time with her than you do with Nynaeve, even.&rdquo; A
slight frown creased her forehead. &ldquo;Does she really
<em>believe</em> she&rsquo;s Birgitte out of the legends? I mean,
the bow and the braid&mdash;every tale mentions those, even if her
bow isn&rsquo;t silver&mdash;and I can&rsquo;t think she was born
with the name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was born with it,&rdquo; Elayne said carefully. It was
true, in a way. Best to steer the talk another way. &ldquo;Nynaeve still
can&rsquo;t decide whether I&rsquo;m a friend or somebody she has to
browbeat into doing what she thinks right. And she spends more time
remembering I&rsquo;m her Queen&rsquo;s daughter than I do. I think
she holds it against me sometimes. You never do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;m not so impressed.&rdquo; Min wore a grin,
but on the other she sounded serious. &ldquo;I was born in the Mountains
of Mist, Elayne, at the mines. Your mother&rsquo;s writ runs pretty
thin that far west.&rdquo; The smile vanished from her face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry, Elayne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stifling a flash of indignation&mdash;Min was every
bit as much a subject of the Lion Throne as Nynaeve!&mdash;Elayne
let her head fall back against the tree. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk of
something happy.&rdquo; The sun sat molten overhead through the branches;
the sky was a clear sheet of blue, unmarked by even one cloud to
the horizon. On impulse, she opened herself to <em>saidar</em> and
let it fill her, as though all the joy of life in the world had
been distilled and every drop in her veins replaced with the
essence. If she could make just one cloud form, it would be a sign
that everything would come out all right. Her mother would be
alive. Rand would love her. And Moghedien&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;would be dealt
with. Somehow. She wove a tenuous web through the sky as far as she
could see, using Air and Water, searching for the moisture for a
cloud. If she only strained hard enough&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the sweetness quickly
built close to pain, the danger sign; draw much more of the Power,
and she could still herself. Just one little cloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happy?&rdquo; Min said. &ldquo;Well, I know you don&rsquo;t want
to talk about Rand, but aside from you and me, he&rsquo;s still the
most important thing in the world right now. And the happiest.
Forsaken fall dead when he appears, and nations line up to bow. The
Aes Sedai here are ready to support him. I know they are, Elayne;
they have to. Why, next Elaida will hand the Tower over to him. The
Last Battle will be a walk for him. He&rsquo;s winning, Elayne.
We&rsquo;re winning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Releasing the Source, Elayne sagged back, staring at
a sky as empty as her mood had become. You did not need to be able
to channel to see the Dark One&rsquo;s hand at work, and if he could
touch the world this much, if he could touch it at all&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;Are
we?&rdquo; she said, but too softly for Min to hear.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The manor house was unfinished yet, the
greatroom&rsquo;s tall wooden panels pale and unstained, but Faile
ni Bashere t&rsquo;Aybara held court every afternoon, as proper for
the lord&rsquo;s wife, in a massive high-backed chair carved with
falcons, just in front of a bare stone fireplace that mirrored
another at the end of the room. The empty chair by her side, carved
with wolves, and a large wolf&rsquo;s head at its peak, should have
been occupied by her husband, Perrin t&rsquo;Bashere Aybara, Perrin
Goldeneyes, Lord of the Two Rivers.</p>

<p>Of course, the manor was only an overgrown farmhouse,
the greatroom stretched fewer than fifteen paces&mdash;how Perrin
had stared when she insisted on it being that big; he was still
used to thinking of himself as a blacksmith, or even a
blacksmith&rsquo;s apprentice&mdash;and the name given her at birth
had been Zarine, not Faile. These things did not matter. Zarine was
a name for a languorous woman who sighed tremulously over poems
composed to her smiles. Faile, the name she had chosen as a sworn
Hunter for the Horn of Valere, meant falcon in the Old Tongue. No
one who got a good look at her face, with its bold nose and high
cheekbones and dark tilted eyes that flashed when she was angry,
could doubt which suited her best. For the rest, intentions counted
a great deal. So did what was right and proper.</p>

<p>Her eyes were flashing at the moment. It had nothing
to do with Perrin&rsquo;s stubbornness, and little with the
unseasonable heat. Though in truth, futilely working a pheasant
feather fan for a breeze against the sweat sliding down her cheeks
did not help her temper at all.</p>

<p>This late in the afternoon few remained of the crowd
who had come to have her judge their disputes. Actually, they came
for Perrin to hear them, but the idea of passing judgment on people
he had grown up among horrified him. Unless she managed to corner
the man, he vanished like a wolf in fog when it came time for the
daily audience. Luckily, the people did not mind it when Lady Faile
heard them instead of Lord Perrin. Or few did, anyway, and those
wise enough to hide the fact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You brought this to me,&rdquo; she said in a flat voice.
The two women perspiring before her chair shuffled their feet
uneasily and studied the polished floorboards.</p>

<p>Coppery-skinned Sharmad Zeffar&rsquo;s plump curves
were covered, if far from obscured, by a high-necked, but barely
opaque Domani dress, the pale golden silk worn at hem and cuffs,
still with a sprinkling of small travel-stains beyond cleaning;
silk was silk, after all, and seldom to be had here. Patrols into
the Mountains of Mist searching for remnants of the past
summer&rsquo;s Trolloc invasion found few of the bestial Trollocs&mdash;and no Myrddraal, thank the Light&mdash;but they did find
refugees nearly every day, ten here, twenty there, five somewhere
else. Most came out of Almoth Plain, but a good many from Tarabon
and, like Sharmad, from Arad Doman, all fleeing lands ruined by
anarchy on top of civil war. Faile did not want to think of how
many died in the mountains. Lacking roads or even paths, the
mountains were no easy journey in the best of times, and these were
far from the best.</p>

<p>Rhea Avin was no refugee, for all she wore a copy of
a Taraboner dress in fine-woven wool, soft gray folds that molded
and emphasized almost as much as Sharmad&rsquo;s thinner garb. Those
who survived the long trek over the mountains brought more than
troubling rumors, skills previously unseen in the Two Rivers, and
hands to work farms depopulated by the Trollocs. Rhea was a pretty,
round-faced woman born not two miles from where the manor now
stood, her dark hair in a wrist-thick braid to her waist. In the
Two Rivers, girls did not braid their hair until the Women&rsquo;s
Circle said they were old enough to marry, whether that was fifteen
or thirty, though few went beyond twenty. In fact, Rhea was a good
five years older than Faile, her hair four years braided, but at
the moment she looked as if she still wore it loose on her
shoulders and had just realized that what had seemed a wonderful
idea at the time was really the stupidest thing she could have
done. For that matter, Sharmad seemed even more abashed, for all
she had a year or two on Rhea; for a Domani to find herself in this
situation must be humiliating. Faile wanted to slap the pair of
them cross-eyed&mdash;except that a lady could not do that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man,&rdquo; she said as levelly as she could manage, &ldquo;is
not a horse or a field. Neither of you can own him, and to ask me
to say which has the right to him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She drew a slow breath.
 &ldquo;If I thought Wil al&rsquo;Seen had been leading you both on, I
might have something to say on the matter.&rdquo; Wil had an eye for the
women, and they for him&mdash;he had very well-turned calves&mdash;but he never made promises. Sharmad looked ready to sink
into the floor; Domani women had a reputation for twining men
around their fingers, after all, not the other way around. &ldquo;As it
is, this is my judgment. You will both go to the Wisdom and explain
matters to her, leaving nothing out. She will handle this. I expect
to hear that she&rsquo;s seen you before nightfall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pair flinched. Daise Congar, the Wisdom here in
Emond&rsquo;s Field, would not tolerate this sort of nonsense. In
fact, she would go well beyond not tolerating it. But they
curtsied, muttering &ldquo;Yes, my Lady&rdquo; in forlorn unison. If not
already, they soon would sorely regret wasting Daise&rsquo;s
time.</p>

<p><em>And mine</em>, Faile thought firmly. Everyone
knew Perrin rarely sat in audience, or they would never have
brought their fool &ldquo;problem.&rdquo; Had he been here where he belonged,
they would have slipped away rather than air it in front of him.
Faile hoped the heat had Daise in a prickle. Too bad there was no
way to get Daise to take Perrin in hand.</p>

<p>Cenn Buie replaced the women almost before they could
get out of the way on dragging feet. Despite leaning heavily on a
walking staff nearly as gnarled as himself, he managed a florid
bow, then spoiled it by raking bony fingers through lank thinning
hair. As usual, his rough brown coat looked slept in. &ldquo;The Light
shine on you, my Lady Faile, and on your honored husband, the Lord
Perrin.&rdquo; The grand words sounded odd in his scratchy voice. &ldquo;Let me
add my wishes for your continued happiness to those of the Council.
Your intelligence and beauty make our lives brighter, as does the
justice of your pronouncements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile drummed her fingers on the arm of her chair
before she could stop herself. Flowery praises instead of the
normal sour grumbling. Reminding her that he sat on the
Emond&rsquo;s Field Village Council and so was a man of influence,
due respect. And playing for sympathy with that staff; the thatcher
was as spry as anyone half his age. He wanted something. &ldquo;What do
you bring me today, Master Buie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cenn straightened, forgetting to prop himself up with
his stick. And forgetting to keep the acrid note out of his voice.
 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all these outlanders flooding in, bringing all sorts of
things we don&rsquo;t want here.&rdquo; He seemed to have forgotten she
was an outlander, too; most Two Rivers folks had. &ldquo;Strange ways, my
Lady. Indecent clothes. You&rsquo;ll be hearing from the women about
the way those Domani hussies dress, if you haven&rsquo;t already.&rdquo;
She had, as it happened, from some of them, though a momentary
gleam in Cenn&rsquo;s eye said he would regret it if she gave in to
their demands. &ldquo;Strangers stealing the food from our mouths, taking
away our trade. That Taraboner fellow and his fool tile-making, for
example. Taking up hands that could be put to useful work. He
doesn&rsquo;t care about good Two Rivers people. Why, he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanning herself, she stopped listening while giving
every appearance of paying close attention; it was a skill her
father had taught her, necessary at times like this. Of course.
Master Hornval&rsquo;s roof tiles would compete with Cenn&rsquo;s
thatchwork.</p>

<p>Not everyone felt as Cenn did about the newcomers.
Haral Luhhan, the Emond&rsquo;s Field blacksmith, had gone into
partnership with a Domani cutler and a whitesmith from Almoth
Plain, and Master Aydaer had hired three men and two women who knew
furniture making and carving, and gilding as well, though there
certainly was no gold lying about for that. Her chair and
Perrin&rsquo;s were their work, and as fine as she had seen
anywhere. For that matter, Cenn himself had taken on half a dozen
helpers, and not all Two Rivers folk; a good many roofs had burned
when the Trollocs came, and new houses were going up everywhere.
Perrin had no right to make her listen to this nonsense alone.</p>

<p>The people of the Two Rivers might have proclaimed
him their lord&mdash;as well they might after he led them to
victory over the Trollocs&mdash;and he might be beginning to
realize he could not change that&mdash;as he certainly should,
when they bowed and called him Lord Perrin to his face right after
he told them not to&mdash;yet he dug in his heels at the trappings
that went with being a lord, all the things that people
<em>expected</em> from their lords and ladies. Worse, he balked at
the duties of a lord. Faile knew those things exactly, as the
eldest surviving child of Davram t&rsquo;Ghaline Bashere, Lord of
Bashere, Tyr and Sidona, Guardian of the Blightborder, Defender of
the Heartland, Marshal-General to Queen Tenobia of Saldaea. True,
she had run away to become a Hunter for the Horn&mdash;and then
given that up for a husband, which sometimes still stunned her&mdash;but she remembered. Perrin listened when she explained, and
even nodded his head in the proper places, but trying to make him
actually do any of it was like trying to make a horse dance the
sa&rsquo;sara.</p>

<p>Cenn finally ran down in splutters, only just
remembering to swallow the invective that bubbled behind his
teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin and I chose to use thatch,&rdquo; Faile said
calmly. While Cenn was still nodding in self-satisfaction, she
added, &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t finished it, yet.&rdquo; He gave a start. &ldquo;You
seem to have taken on more roofs than you can handle, Master Buie.
If ours isn&rsquo;t done soon, I fear we will have to ask Master
Hornval about his tiles.&rdquo; Cenn&rsquo;s mouth worked in vigorous
silence; if she put a tile roof on the manor, others would follow.
 &ldquo;I have enjoyed your discourse, but I am sure you would rather
finish my roof than waste time in idle conversation, however
pleasant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lips thinning, Cenn glowered for a moment, then made
a sketchy bow. Muttering something unintelligible except for a
strangled &ldquo;my Lady&rdquo; at the end, he stalked out thumping the bare
floor with his stick. The things people found to waste her time.
Perrin was going to do his share of this if she had to tie him hand
and foot.</p>

<p>The rest were not so provoking. A once-stout woman,
her patched flower-embroidered dress hanging on her like a sack,
who had come all the way from Toman Head, beyond Almoth Plain,
wanted to deal in herbs and cures. Hulking Jon Ayellin rubbing his
bald head and skinny Thad Torfinn twisting the lapels of his coat,
disputing the boundaries of their fields. Two dark Domani men in
long leather vests, with close-trimmed beards, miners who thought
they had seen signs of gold and silver nearby on their way through
the mountains. And iron, though they were less interested in that.
And finally, a wiry Taraboner, a transparent veil across her narrow
face and her pale hair in a multitude of thin braids, who claimed
to have been a master carpet-weaver and to know the making of rug
looms.</p>

<p>The woman with an interest in herbs Faile directed to
the local Women&rsquo;s Circle; if Espara Soman knew what she was
about, they would find her a place under one of the village
Wisdoms. With all the new people coming in, many in a bad way from
the journey, not a Wisdom in the Two Rivers but had an apprentice
or two, and all were on the lookout for more. Maybe not exactly
what Espara wanted, but where she would have to start. A few
questions made it plain that neither Thad nor Jon really remembered
where the boundary lay&mdash;apparently they had been arguing it
since before she was born&mdash;so she directed them to split the
difference. Which seemed to be what each had thought the Village
Council would decide, the reason for keeping the argument between
themselves so long.</p>

<p>The others she granted the permission they sought.
They did not really need permission, but it was best to let them
know where authority lay from the start. In return for her consent
and enough silver to buy supplies, Faile made the two Domani agree
to give Perrin a tenth part of what they found, as well as to
locate the iron mentioned in passing. Perrin would not like it, but
the Two Rivers had nothing like taxes, and a lord was expected to
do things and provide things that required money. And the iron
would be as useful as the gold. As for Liale Mosrara, if the
Taraboner claimed more skill than she had, her enterprise would not
last long, but if she did&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;three cloth-weavers already insured
that the merchants would find more than raw wool when they came
down from Baerlon next year, and decent carpets would be another
trade item to bring in more coin. Liale promised the first and
finest from her looms to the manor, and Faile nodded a gracious
acceptance of the gift; she could give more if and when the carpets
appeared. The floors did need covering. All in all, everyone seemed
reasonably satisfied. Even Jon and Thad.</p>

<p>As the Taraboner woman backed away curtsying, Faile
stood, glad to be done, then stopped when four women entered
through one of the doorways that flanked the far fireplace, all
sweating in dark stout Two Rivers woolens. Daise Congar, as tall as
most men and wider, overtopped the other Wisdoms and thrust herself
forward to take the lead here on the outskirts of her own village.
Edelle Gaelin, from Watch Hill, gray-braided and slender, made it
plain with her straight back and stiff face that she thought she
should have Daise&rsquo;s place, by virtue of age and her long time
in office if no other reason. Elwinn Taron, the Wisdom of Deven
Ride, was the shortest, a round woman with a pleasant motherly
smile that she wore even when she was making people do what they
did not want to. The last, Milla al&rsquo;Azar, from Taren Ferry,
trailed behind; the youngest, almost young enough to be
Edelle&rsquo;s daughter, she always appeared uncertain around the
others.</p>

<p>Faile remained standing, fanning herself slowly. She
truly wished Perrin there, now. Very much. These women had as much
authority in their villages as the mayor&mdash;sometimes, in some
ways, more&mdash;and they had to be handled carefully, with due
dignity and respect. That made matters difficult. They turned into
simpering girls around Perrin, eager to please, but with her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Two Rivers had had no nobles in centuries; they had not seen so
much as a representative of the Queen in Caemlyn for seven
generations. Everyone was still working out how to behave toward a
lord and a lady, including these four. Sometimes they forgot she
was the Lady Faile and saw only a young woman whose marriage Daise
had presided over just a few months ago. They could be all curtsies
and &ldquo;yes, of course, my Lady,&rdquo; and right in the middle of it tell
her exactly what to do about something without seeing anything at
all incongruous. <em>You are not going to leave this to me anymore,
Perrin</em>.</p>

<p>They curtsied now, with varying degrees of skill, and
said, &ldquo;The Light shine on you, my Lady,&rdquo; on top of one another.</p>

<p>Amenities out of the way, Daise started in before she
was completely upright again. &ldquo;Three more boys have run off, my
Lady.&rdquo; Her tone fell halfway between the respect of the words and
the now-you-listen-to-me-young-woman she sometimes used. &ldquo;Dav
Ayellin, Ewin Finngar, and Elam Dowtry. Run off to see the world
because of Lord Perrin&rsquo;s stories about what&rsquo;s out
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile blinked in surprise. Those three were hardly
boys. Dav and Elam were as old as Perrin, and Ewin was her own
age. And Perrin&rsquo;s stories, which he told seldom and
reluctantly, were hardly the only way Two Rivers youths learned
about the outside world now. &ldquo;I could ask Perrin to speak to you,
if you wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They stirred, Daise looking for him expectantly,
Edelle and Milla automatically smoothing their skirts, Elwinn just
as unconsciously drawing her braid over her shoulder and arranging
it carefully. Abruptly they realized what they were doing and
froze, not looking at one another. Or at her. The one advantage
Faile had with them was that they knew the effect her husband had
on them. So many times she had seen one or another firm herself up
after meeting with Perrin, plainly vowing not to let it happen
again; so many times she had seen resolution fly out the window at
a sight of him. None was really sure whether she preferred to deal
with him or with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will not be necessary,&rdquo; Edelle said after a
moment. &ldquo;Boys running off are a bother, but only a bother.&rdquo; Her
tone had slid a little further from &ldquo;my Lady&rdquo; than Daise&rsquo;s,
and plump Elwinn added a smile suitable for mother to young
daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as we&rsquo;re here, my dear, we really might
as well mention something else. Water. You see, some of the people
are worried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t rained in months,&rdquo; Edelle added, and
Daise nodded.</p>

<p>This time Faile did blink. They were too intelligent
to think Perrin could do anything about that. &ldquo;The springs are all
still flowing, and Perrin has ordered more wells dug.&rdquo; Actually he
had only suggested it, but it had come to the same thing,
fortunately. &ldquo;And long before planting time, the irrigation canals
from the Waterwood will be done.&rdquo; That was her doing; half the
fields in Saldaea were irrigated, but no one here had ever heard of
the practice. &ldquo;Anyway, the rains have to come sooner or later. The
canals are only in case.&rdquo; Daise nodded again, slowly, and Elwinn
and Edelle. But they knew all this as well as she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the rain,&rdquo; Milla muttered. &ldquo;Not
exactly, anyway. It isn&rsquo;t natural. You see, none of us can
Listen to the Wind.&rdquo; She hunched her shoulders under the
others&rsquo; sudden frowns. Plainly she was saying too much, and
giving away secrets besides. Supposedly all the Wisdoms could
predict the weather by Listening to the Wind; at least, they said
that they all could. But even so Milla plowed on doggedly. &ldquo;Well,
we can&rsquo;t! We look at clouds instead, and how the birds behave,
and the ants and caterpillars and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Drawing a deep breath,
she straightened, but still avoided the other Wisdoms&rsquo; eyes.
Faile wondered how she managed to deal with the Women&rsquo;s Circle
in Taren Ferry, much less the Village Council. Of course, they were
as new at it as Milla; that village had lost its whole population
when the Trollocs came, and everyone there now was new. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t natural, my Lady. The first snows should have been here
weeks ago, but it might as well be the middle of summer. We&rsquo;re
not worried, my Lady, we&rsquo;re frightened! If nobody else will
admit it, I will. I lie awake most nights. I haven&rsquo;t slept
properly in a month, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She trailed off, color blooming in
her face as she realized she might have gone too far. A Wisdom was
supposed to be in control in all times; she did not run around
saying she was frightened.</p>

<p>The others shifted their gazes from Milla to Faile.
They said nothing, faces expressionless enough for Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>Faile understood, now. Milla had spoken simple truth.
The weather was <em>not</em> natural; it was most unnatural. Faile
often lay awake herself, praying for rain, or better still snow,
trying not to think of what lurked behind the heat and drought. Yet
a Wisdom was supposed to reassure others. Who could she go to when
she needed reassurance herself?</p>

<p>These women might not have known what they were
doing, but they had come to the right place. Part of the compact
between noble and commoner, ingrained in Faile from her birth, was
that nobles provided safety and security. And a part of giving
security was to remind people that evil times were not forever. If
today was bad, then tomorrow would be better, and if not tomorrow,
then the day after. She wished she could be certain of that
herself, but she had been taught to give those under her strength
even when she had none herself, to soothe their fears, not infect
them with her own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perrin told me about his people before I ever came
here,&rdquo; she said. He was not a man to brag, but things had a way of
coming out. &ldquo;When hail flattens your crops, when the winter kills
half your sheep, you buckle down and keep going. When Trollocs
devastated the Two Rivers, you fought back, and when you were done
with them, you set about rebuilding without missing a step.&rdquo; She
would not have believed that without seeing for herself, not of
southerners. These people would have done very well in Saldaea,
where Trolloc raids were a matter of course, in the northern parts
at least. &ldquo;I cannot tell you the weather will be what it should
tomorrow. I can tell you that Perrin and I will do what needs to be
done, whatever can be done. And I don&rsquo;t need to tell you that
you will take what each day brings, whatever it is, and be ready to
face the next. That is the kind of people the Two Rivers breeds.
That is who you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They truly were intelligent. If they had not admitted
to themselves why they had come, they had to now. Had they been
less intelligent, they might have taken umbrage. But even words
they had said themselves before had the desired effect coming from
someone else. Of course, that carried its own embarrassment. It was
a proper muddle, and they were a study in crimson cheeks and
unspoken wishes to be somewhere else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of course,&rdquo; Daise said. Planting stout fists
on ample hips, she stared at the other Wisdoms, daring them to
gainsay her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said as much, haven&rsquo;t I? The girl
talks sense. I said as much when she first came here. That girl has
a head on her, I said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edelle sniffed. &ldquo;Did anyone say she didn&rsquo;t,
Daise? I didn&rsquo;t hear it. She does very well.&rdquo; To Faile she
added, &ldquo;You do very well, indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Milla bobbed a curtsy. &ldquo;Thank you, Lady Faile. I know
I&rsquo;ve said the same to fifty people, but coming from you,
somehow it&mdash;&rdquo; A loud <em>harrumph</em> from Daise cut her
short; that was going too far. Milla grew redder in the face.</p>

<p>&#145;This is very nice work, my Lady.&rdquo; Elwinn leaned
forward to finger the narrow, divided riding skirt that Faile
favored. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Taraboner seamstress down in Deven Ride
who could do even better for you, though. If you don&rsquo;t mind my
saying. I had a word with her, and she only makes decent dresses
now, except for married women.&rdquo; That motherly smile came onto her
face again, indulgent and iron at the same time. &ldquo;Or if
they&rsquo;re courting. Beautiful things, she makes. Why, she might
count it a pleasure to work with your coloring and figure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Daise began smiling complacently before the other
woman was done. &ldquo;Therille Marza, right here in Emond&rsquo;s Field,
is already making Lady Faile half a dozen dresses. And the most
beautiful gown.&rdquo; Elwinn drew herself up, and Edelle pursed her
lips, and even Milla looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>As far as Faile was concerned, the audience was over.
The Domani seamstress required a firm hand and constant vigilance
to keep her from dressing Faile for the court in Bandar Eban. The
gown had been Daise&rsquo;s idea, sprung as a surprise, and even if
it was in the Saldaean style rather than Domani, Faile did not know
where she was to wear it. It would be a long time before the Two
Rivers ran to balls or promenades. Left to themselves, the Wisdoms
would soon be competing to see which village would dress her.</p>

<p>She offered them tea, with a casual comment that they
could discuss how to hearten the people about the weather. That hit
too close to home, after the last few minutes, and they nearly
tripped over themselves regretting duties that would not allow them
to stay.</p>

<p>Thoughtfully, she watched them go, Milla drawing up
the rear as usual, a child tagging after older sisters. It might be
possible to have a few quiet words with some of the Women&rsquo;s
Circle in Taren Ferry. Each village needed a strong mayor and a
strong Wisdom to stand up for their interests. Quiet, careful
words. When Perrin had discovered she had been talking to the men
in Taren Ferry before the election for mayor&mdash;if a man had
good wits and was strong for her and Perrin, why should the men who
were going to vote not know that she and Perrin returned that
support?&mdash;when he found out&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;he was a gentle man, slow
to anger, but just to be safe she had barricaded herself in their
bedroom until he cooled down. Which had not happened until she
promised not to &ldquo;interfere&rdquo; again in any mayoral election, in the
open or behind his back. That last had been most unfair of him. It
was most inconvenient, too. But it had not occurred to him to
mention Women&rsquo;s Circle voting. Well, what he did not know
would do him a great deal of good. And Taren Ferry, too.</p>

<p>Thinking of him made her remember her promise to
herself. The feathered fan picked up speed. Today had not been the
worst for nonsense, and not even the worst with the Wisdoms&mdash;there had been no questions about when Lord Perrin could expect an
heir, the Light be blessed!&mdash;but maybe the unrelenting heat
had finally screwed her irritation to the sticking place. Perrin
would do his duty, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thunder rolled over the manor, and lightning lit the
windows. Hope swelled inside her. If rain had come&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She ran silently on slippered feet, searching out
Perrin. She wanted to share the rain with him. And she still
intended a few firm words. More than a few, if necessary.</p>

<p>Perrin was where she expected, all the way up on the
third floor, on the roofed porch at the front, a curly-haired man
in a plain brown coat, with heavy shoulders and arms. Broad back to
her, he was leaning against one of the porch columns. Staring down
at the ground to one side of the manor, not up at the sky. Faile
stopped in the doorway.</p>

<p>Thunder boomed again, and lightning sheeted blue
across the sky. Heat lightning, in a cloudless sky. Not a herald of
rain. No rain to break heat. No snow to follow. Sweat beaded on her
face, but she shivered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The audience is over?&rdquo; Perrin said, and she jumped.
He had not raised his head. It was difficult sometimes to remember
how sensitive his hearing was. Or he could have smelled her; she
hoped it was the perfume, not the sweat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I half thought I&rsquo;d find you with Gwil or Hal.&rdquo;
That was one of his worst faults; she tried to train servants, and
to him they were men to laugh with and have a mug of ale. At least
he did not have a roving eye, as so many men did. He never realized
Calle Coplin had taken service in the manor because she hoped to do
more for Lord Perrin than make his bed. He had not even noticed
when Faile chased Calle out with a stick of kindling.</p>

<p>Moving up beside him, she saw what he was watching.
Two men, stripped to the waist, working with wooden practice swords
below. Tam al&rsquo;Thor was a solid, graying man, Aram slender and
young. Aram was learning fast. Very fast. Tam had been a soldier,
and a blademaster, but Aram was pressing him hard.</p>

<p>Automatically her eyes went to the tents clustered in
a stone-fenced field half a mile toward the Westwood. The rest of
the Tinkers were camped amid half-finished wagons like small houses
on wheels. Of course, they no longer acknowledged Aram as one of
them, not since he had picked up that sword. The Tuatha&rsquo;an
never did violence, not for any reason. She wondered whether they
would go as they planned, when the wagons the Trollocs had burned
were replaced. After gathering in all those who had hidden in the
thickets, they yet numbered little more than a hundred. Probably
they would, leaving Aram behind of his own choice. No
Tuatha&rsquo;an had ever settled in one place that she had ever
heard.</p>

<p>But then, people in the Two Rivers used to say
nothing there ever changed, yet a great deal had since the
Trollocs. Emond&rsquo;s Field, just a hundred paces south of the
manor, was larger than she had first seen, all the burned houses
rebuilt and new going up. Some in brick, another new thing. And
some with tile roofs. At the rate new dwellings were being erected,
the manor would be in the village soon. There was talk of a wall,
in case the Trollocs returned. Change. A handful of children were
following Loial&rsquo;s great height along one of the village
streets. Only a few months since the sight of the Ogier, with his
tufted ears and broad nose almost as wide as his face, half again
as tall as a man, had drawn every child in the village in gaping
wonder, and their mothers in a terror to protect them. Now mothers
sent their children for Loial to read to them. The outlanders in
their strangely cut coats and dresses, dotted among Emond&rsquo;s
Fielders, stood out almost as much as Loial, but no one looked at
them twice, or at the village&rsquo;s three Aiel, strange, tall folk
in browns and grays. Until a few weeks ago there had been two Aes
Sedai here, as well, and even they had gotten no more than
respectful bows and curtsies. Change. The two flagpoles not far
from the Winespring, on the Green, were visible over the rooftops,
one bearing the red-bordered red wolf&rsquo;s head that had become
Perrin&rsquo;s sigil, the other the crimson eagle in flight that
marked Manetheren. Manetheren had vanished in the Trolloc Wars,
some two thousand years ago, but this land had been part of it, and
the Two Rivers flew that flag almost by acclamation. Change, and
they had no notion how large it was, how inexorable it was. But
Perrin would see them through it to whatever came beyond. With her
help, he would.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I used to hunt rabbits with Gwil,&rdquo; Perrin said.
 &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only a few years older than me, and he used to take me
hunting sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took her a moment to remember what he was talking
about. &ldquo;Gwil is trying to learn how to be a footman. You don&rsquo;t
help him when you invite him to go smoke his pipe with you in the
stables and talk horses.&rdquo; She took a deep slow breath. This would
not be easy. &ldquo;You have a duty to these people, Perrin. However hard
it is, however much you want not to, you have to do your duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;I can feel him tugging at
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His voice was so strange that she reached up to grip
his short beard and make him look down at her. His golden eyes,
still as strange and mysterious to her as ever, looked sad. &ldquo;What
do you mean? You might think fondly of Gwil, but he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Rand, Faile. He needs me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The knot inside her that she had been trying to deny
clenched even tighter. She had convinced herself this danger had
gone with the Aes Sedai. Foolish, that. She was married to a
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, a man fated to bend lives around him into
the shape the Pattern required, and he had grown up with two more
<em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>, one the Dragon Reborn himself. It was a
part of him she had to share. She did not like sharing even a hair,
but there it was. &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to him.&rdquo; His gaze shifted for a moment, and her
eyes followed. Against the wall leaned a blacksmith&rsquo;s heavy
hammer and an axe with a wicked half-moon blade and a haft a pace
long. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His voice was almost a whisper. &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t find how to tell you. I&rsquo;ll go tonight, when
everyone&rsquo;s asleep. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much time,
and it could be a long way. Master al&rsquo;Thor and Master Cauthon
will help you with the mayors, if you need it. I spoke to them.&rdquo; He
tried to make his voice lighter, a pitiful effort. &ldquo;You
shouldn&rsquo;t have any trouble with the Wisdoms anyway. Funny;
when I was a boy the Wisdoms always seemed so fearsome, but
they&rsquo;re really easy as long as you&rsquo;re firm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faile compressed her lips. So he had spoken to Tam
al&rsquo;Thor and Abell Cauthon, had he, but not to her? And the
Wisdoms! She would like to make him wear her skin for a day and see
how easy the Wisdoms were. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t leave as quickly as that.
It will take time to organize a proper entourage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. &ldquo;We? You&rsquo;re not
going! It will be&mdash;!&rdquo; He coughed, went on in a milder tone.
 &ldquo;It will be best if one of us stays here. If the lord goes off, the
lady should remain to take care of things. That makes sense. More
refugees every day. All those disputes to be settled. If you go,
too, it&rsquo;ll be worse than the Trollocs around here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How could he think she would not notice such a clumsy
recovery? He had been going to say it would be dangerous. How could
his wanting to keep her out of danger always make her feel so warm
inside at the same time it made her so angry? &ldquo;We will do what you
think best,&rdquo; she said mildly, and he blinked suspiciously,
scratched his beard, then nodded.</p>

<p>Now it was only necessary to make him see what really
was best. At least he had not said right out she <em>could not</em>
go. Once he dug in his heels, she could as easily shift a grain
barn with her hands as shift him, but with care it could be
avoided. Usually.</p>

<p>Abruptly she threw her arms around him and buried her
face against his broad chest. His strong hands smoothed her hair
softly; he probably thought she was worried about him leaving.
Well, she was, in a way. Just not about him leaving without her; he
had not yet learned what it meant to have a Saldaean wife. They had
been getting on so well away from Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Why did the
Dragon Reborn need Perrin now, so strongly that Perrin could feel
it across however many hundred leagues lay between them? Why was
time so short? Why? Perrin&rsquo;s shirt clung to his sweaty chest,
and the unnatural heat sent more sliding down her face, but Faile
shivered.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">One hand on his sword hilt, Gawyn Trakand bounced a
small rock on his palm as he made another circuit of his men,
checking their positions around the tree-topped hill. A dry hot
wind carrying dust across the rolling brown grasslands fluttered
the plain green cloak hanging down his back. Nothing to be seen but
dead grass, scattered thickets and a dotting of mostly withered
bushes. There was too much front to cover with the men he had if it
came to a fight here. He had grouped them in clusters of five
swordsmen afoot, with bowmen fifty paces back up the hill. Fifty
more waited with lance and horse near the camp on the crest, to be
committed where necessary. He hoped it would not be necessary
today.</p>

<p>There had been fewer Younglings in the beginning, but
their reputation brought recruits. The added numbers would be
helpful; no recruit was allowed out of Tar Valon until he was up to
standard. It was not that he expected fighting this day more than
any other, but he had learned it came most often when unexpected.
Only Aes Sedai would wait until the last minute to tell a man about
a thing like what was to happen today.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is everything well?&rdquo; he said, stopping beside a
group of swordsmen. In spite of the heat, some wore their green
cloaks so that Gawyn&rsquo;s white charging boar showed, embroidered
on the breast.</p>

<p>Jisao Hamora was the youngest, still with a
boy&rsquo;s grin, but he was also the only one of the five with the
small silver tower on his collar, marking him a veteran of the
fighting in the White Tower. He answered. &ldquo;All is well, my
Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Younglings deserved their name. Gawyn himself, a
few years past twenty, was among the oldest. It was a rule that
they accepted none who had served in any army, or borne arms for
any lord or lady, or even worked as a merchant&rsquo;s guard. The
first Younglings had gone to the Tower as boys and young men to be
trained by the Warders, the finest swordsmen, the finest fighters,
in the world, and they continued part of that tradition, at least,
though Warders no longer trained them. Youth was no detriment. They
had held a small ceremony only a week past for the first whiskers
Benji Dalfor had ever shaved that were not fuzz, and he bore a scar
across his cheek from the Tower fighting. The Aes Sedai had been
too busy for Healing in the days right after Siuan Sanche was
deposed as Amyrlin. She might still be Amyrlin if the Younglings
had not faced many of their former teachers and bested them in the
halls of the Tower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any point to this, my Lord?&rdquo; Hal Moir
asked. He was two years older than Jisao, and like many who did not
wear the silver tower, he regretted not having been there. He would
learn. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a glimmer of Aielmen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think not?&rdquo; Without any hefting to give warning,
Gawyn hurled the rock as hard as he could at the only bush close
enough to hit, a scraggly thing. The rustle of dead leaves was the
only sound, but the bush shook just a bit more than it should have,
as though a man somehow hidden behind it had been struck in a
tender place. Exclamations rose from the newer men; Jisao only
eased his sword. &ldquo;An Aiel, Hal, can hide in a fold in the ground
you wouldn&rsquo;t even stumble over.&rdquo; Not that Gawyn knew any more
of Aiel than he read in books, but he had read every book he could
find in the White Tower&rsquo;s library by any man who had actually
fought them, every book by any soldier who seemed to know what he
was talking about. A man had to ready himself for the future, and
it seemed the world&rsquo;s future was war. &ldquo;But if the Light
pleases, there won&rsquo;t be any fighting today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord!&rdquo; came a hail from up the hill as the
lookout spotted what he just had: three women emerging from a small
thicket a few hundred paces west, coming toward the hill. West; a
surprise. But Aiel always liked surprise.</p>

<p>He had read about Aiel women fighting alongside the
men, but these women could never fight in those dark bulky skirts
and white blouses. They carried shawls looped over their arms
despite the heat. On the other hand, how had they reached that
thicket unseen? &ldquo;Keep your eyes open, and not on them,&rdquo; he said,
and then disobeyed himself by watching the three Wise Ones, the
emissaries from the Shaido Aiel, with interest. They could be no
other, out here.</p>

<p>They came on at a stately pace, not at all as if
approaching a large party of armed men. Their hair was long, to the
waist&mdash;he had read that Aiel kept it cut short&mdash;and
held back by folded kerchiefs. They wore so many bracelets and long
necklaces of gold and silver and ivory that the glitter should have
given them away at a mile.</p>

<p>Straight-backed and proud-faced, the three women
strode past the swordsmen with hardly a glance and started up the
hill. Their leader was a golden-haired woman, her loose blouse
unlaced to show considerable tanned cleavage. The other two were
gray, with leathery faces; she had to be less than half their
age.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind asking that one to dance,&rdquo; one
of the Younglings said admiringly when the women had gone past. He
was a good ten years younger than the golden-haired woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t if I were you, Arwin,&rdquo; Gawyn said
dryly. &ldquo;It might be misunderstood.&rdquo; He had read that Aiel called
battle &ldquo;the dance.&rdquo; &ldquo;Besides, she&rsquo;d have your liver for
dinner.&rdquo; He had caught a glimpse of her pale green eyes, and he had
never seen harder.</p>

<p>He watched the Wise Ones until they had climbed the
hill to where half a dozen Aes Sedai waited with their Warders.
Those who had Warders; two were Red Ajah, and Reds did not. When
the women disappeared into one of the tall white tents, and the
five Warders had taken up guard around it, he went on with his
circuit of the hill.</p>

<p>The Younglings were alert since word of the
Aiel&rsquo;s arrival had spread, which did not please him. They
should have been this alert before. Even most who did not wear the
silver tower had seen fighting around Tar Valon. Eamon Valda, the
Whitecloak Lord Captain in command, had pulled nearly all his men
out to the west more than a month ago, but the handful he left
behind tried to keep together the brigands and bullyboys Valda had
gathered. The Younglings had dispersed those, at least. Gawyn
wished he could think they had driven Valda off, too&mdash;the
Tower had certainly kept its own soldiers far from the skirmishing,
for all that the Whitecloaks&rsquo; only reason for being there had
been to see what harm they could do the Tower&mdash;but he
suspected that Valda had his own reasons. Likely orders from Pedron
Niall, and Gawyn would have given much to know what they were.
Light, but he hated not knowing. It was like fumbling your way in
the dark.</p>

<p>The truth was, he admitted, that he was irritated.
Not only about the Aiel, about not being told of this meeting until
this morning. He had not been told where they were going, either,
until he was taken aside by Coiren Sedai, the Gray sister who led
the Aes Sedai. Elaida had been closemouthed and imperious when she
was his mother&rsquo;s advisor in Caemlyn; since being raised to the
Amyrlin Seat she made the old Elaida seem open and warm. No doubt
she had pressured him to form this escort as much to get him away
from Tar Valon as for any other reason.</p>

<p>The Younglings had sided with her in the fighting&mdash;the old Amyrlin was stripped of Staff and Stole by the Hall,
the attempt to free her rebellion against the law, clear and simple&mdash;but Gawyn had had his doubts about all Aes Sedai long before
he heard the charges against Siuan Sanche read. That they pulled
strings and made thrones dance was a thing said so often that he
had hardly paid it any mind, but then he saw the strings being
pulled. The effects at least, and his sister Elayne was the one who
danced, danced right out of his sight, out of existence for all he
knew. Her, and another. He had fought to keep Siuan imprisoned,
then turned around and let her escape. If Elaida ever discovered
that, his mother&rsquo;s crown would not keep him alive.</p>

<p>Even with that, Gawyn had chosen to stay, because his
mother had always supported the Tower, because his sister wanted to
be Aes Sedai. And because another woman wanted to. Egwene
al&rsquo;Vere. He had no right to even think of her, but abandoning
the Tower would be abandoning her. For such flimsy reasons did a
man choose his fate. Knowing they were flimsy did not change them,
though.</p>

<p>He glared at the sere, windswept grasslands as he
strode from one position to the next. So here he was, hoping the
Aiel did not decide to attack despite&mdash;or because of&mdash;whatever it was the Shaido Wise Ones were talking over with Coiren
and the others. He suspected there might be enough out there to
overrun him even with Aes Sedai help. He was on his way to
Cairhien, and he did not know how he felt about that. Coiren had
made him swear to hold his mission secret, and even then seemed
afraid of what she was saying. Well she might be. It was always
best to examine carefully what an Aes Sedai said&mdash;they could
not lie, but they could spin truth like a top&mdash;yet even so,
he found no hidden meanings. The six Aes Sedai were going to ask
the Dragon Reborn to accompany them to the Tower, with the
Younglings, commanded by the son of the Queen of Andor, for an
escort of honor. There could be only one reason, one that plainly
shocked Coiren enough that she only hinted at it. It shocked Gawyn.
Elaida intended to announce to the world that the White Tower
supported the Dragon Reborn.</p>

<p>It was almost unbelievable. Elaida had been a Red
before she became Amyrlin. Reds hated the very idea of men
channeling; they did not think much of men in general, for that
matter. Yet the fall of the once-invincible Stone of Tear,
fulfilling prophecy, said Rand al&rsquo;Thor was the Dragon Reborn,
and even Elaida said the Last Battle was coming. Gawyn could hardly
reconcile the frightened farmboy who had literally fallen into the
Royal Palace in Caemlyn with the man in the rumors that drifted up
the River Erinin to Tar Valon. It was said he had hanged Tairen
High Lords and let Aiel loot the Stone. He had certainly brought
the Aiel across the Spine of the World, for only the second time
since the Breaking, to ravage Cairhien. Perhaps it was the madness.
Gawyn had rather liked Rand al&rsquo;Thor; he regretted that the man
had turned out to be what he was.</p>

<p>By the time he came back to Jisao&rsquo;s group,
someone else was in sight coming from the west, a peddler in a
floppy hat, leading a slab-sided pack mule. Straight toward the
hill; he had seen them.</p>

<p>Jisao shifted, then went still again when Gawyn
touched his arm. Gawyn knew what the younger man was thinking, but
if the Aiel decided to kill this fellow, there was nothing they
could do. Coiren would be less than pleased if he started a battle
with the people she was talking to.</p>

<p>The peddler shambled along unconcernedly, right by
the bush Gawyn had disturbed with his rock. The mule started
cropping desultorily at the brown grass as the man pulled off his
hat, sketched a bow that took them all in and began mopping his
grizzled face with a grimy neckerchief. &ldquo;The Light shine on you, my
Lords. You&rsquo;re well set up for traveling in these parlous
times, as any man can see, but if there&rsquo;s any small thing you
need, like as not old Mil Tesen&rsquo;s got it in his packs.
Ain&rsquo;t no better prices in ten miles, my Lords.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gawyn doubted there was as much as a farm within ten
miles. &ldquo;Parlous times indeed, Master Tesen. Aren&rsquo;t you afraid
of Aiel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aiel, my Lord? They&rsquo;s all down to Cairhien. Old
Mil can smell Aiel, he can. Truth, he wishes there was some here.
Fine trading with Aiel. They got lots of gold. From Cairhien. And
they don&rsquo;t bother peddlers. Everybody knows that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gawyn forbore asking why, if the Aiel in Cairhien
made such good trading, the man was not heading south. &ldquo;What news
of the world, Master Tesen? We&rsquo;re from the north, and you may
know what hasn&rsquo;t caught up to us yet from the south.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, big doings southward, my Lord. You&rsquo;ll have
heard of Cairhien? Him that calls himself Dragon and all?&rdquo; Gawyn
nodded, and he went on. &ldquo;Well, now he&rsquo;s taken Andor. Most of
it, anyway. Their queen&rsquo;s dead. Some say he&rsquo;ll take the
whole world before&mdash;&rdquo; The man cut off with a strangled yelp
before Gawyn realized he had seized the fellow&rsquo;s lapels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Queen Morgase is dead? Speak, man! Quickly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tesen rolled his eyes looking for help, but he spoke,
and quickly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they say, my Lord. Old Mil
don&rsquo;t know, but he thinks it so. Everybody says it, my Lord.
Everybody says this Dragon did it. My Lord? Old Mil&rsquo;s neck, my
Lord! My Lord!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gawyn jerked his hands away as though burned. He felt
on fire inside. It had been another neck he wanted in his hands.
 &ldquo;The Daughter-Heir.&rdquo; His voice sounded far off. &ldquo;Is there any word
of the Daughter-Heir, Elayne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tesen backed away a long pace as soon as he was free.
 &ldquo;Not as old Mil knows, my Lord. Some says she&rsquo;s dead, too.
Some says he killed her, but old Mil don&rsquo;t know for sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gawyn nodded slowly. Thought seemed to be drifting up
from the bottom of a well. <em>My blood shed before hers; my life
given before hers</em>. &ldquo;Thank you, Master Tesen. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; <em>My
blood shed before hers</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that was the oath he had taken
when barely tall enough to peer into Elayne&rsquo;s cradle. &ldquo;You may
trade with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;some of my men may need&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Gareth Bryne had
had to explain to him what it meant, but even then he had known he
had to keep that oath if he failed at everything else in his life.
Jisao and the others were looking at him worriedly. &ldquo;Take care of
the peddler,&rdquo; he told Jisao roughly, and turned away.</p>

<p>His mother dead, and Elayne. Only a rumor, but rumors
on everyone&rsquo;s lips sometimes had a way of turning out true. He
climbed half a dozen paces toward the Aes Sedai camp before he knew
it. His hands hurt. He had to look to realize they were cramping
from the grip he had on his sword hilt, and he had to force them to
let go. Coiren and the others meant to take Rand al&rsquo;Thor to
Tar Valon, but if his mother was dead&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Elayne. If they were
dead, he would see whether the Dragon Reborn could live with a
sword through his heart!</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Adjusting her red-fringed shawl, Katerine Alruddin
rose from the cushions with the other women in the tent. She almost
sniffed when Coiren, plump and pompous, intoned, &ldquo;As it has been
agreed, so shall it be.&rdquo; This was a meeting with savages, not the
conclusion of a treaty between the Tower and a ruler.</p>

<p>The Aiel women showed no more reaction, no more
expression, than when they first arrived. That was something of a
surprise; kings and queens betrayed their innermost feelings when
faced by two or three Aes Sedai, much less half a dozen; brutish
savages surely should be trembling visibly by now. Perhaps that
should have been almost no reaction. Their leader&mdash;her name
was Sevanna, followed by some nonsense about &ldquo;septs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shaido
Aiel&rdquo; and &ldquo;wise&rdquo;&mdash;said, &ldquo;It is agreed so long as I get to see
his face.&rdquo; She had a sulky mouth, and wore her blouse unlaced to
attract men&rsquo;s eyes; that the Aiel chose one like her to lead
showed how crude they were. &ldquo;I want to see him, and have him see
me, when he is defeated. Only with that will your Tower be allied
to the Shaido.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hint of eagerness in her voice made Katerine
suppress a smile. Wise? This Sevanna truly was a fool. The White
Tower did not have allies; there were those who served its ends
willingly and those who served unwillingly, no others.</p>

<p>A slight thinning at the corners of Coiren&rsquo;s
mouth betrayed her irritation. The Gray was a good negotiator, but
she did like to have things done just so, every foot placed exactly
where it had been planned to go. &ldquo;Without doubt, your service
deserves what you ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the gray-haired Aiel&mdash;Tarva, or some
such&mdash;narrowed her eyes, but Sevanna nodded, hearing what
Coiren had wanted her to hear.</p>

<p>Coiren set out to escort the Aiel women as far as the
foot of the hill, along with Erian, a Green, and Nesune, a Brown,
and the five Warders they had between them. Katerine went as far as
the edge of the trees to watch. On arrival the Aiel had been
allowed to come up alone, like the supplicants they were, but now
they were given all honor to make them believe they truly were
friends and allies. Katerine wondered whether they were civilized
enough to recognize the subtleties.</p>

<p>Gawyn was down there, sitting on a rock, staring off
across the grasslands. What would that young man think if he
learned he and his children were only here to get them away from
Tar Valon? Neither Elaida nor the Hall liked having a pack of young
wolves about who refused to accept the leash. Perhaps the Shaido
could be prevailed upon to eliminate the problem. Elaida had
intimated as much. That way his death would not rebound against the
Tower with his mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you stare so at the young man much longer,
Katerine, I will begin to think you should be a Green.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katerine stamped out a quick spark of anger and
inclined her head respectfully. &ldquo;I was only speculating on his
thoughts, Galina Sedai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was as much respect as was proper in so public a
place, and perhaps even a touch more. Galina Casban looked less
than Katerine&rsquo;s true age at most and was twice that, and for
eighteen years the round-faced woman had been the head of the Red
Ajah. A fact not known outside the Ajah, of course; such things
were for the Ajah alone. She was not even one of the Sitters for
the Red in the Hall of the Tower; Katerine suspected that the heads
of most other Ajahs were. Elaida would have named her leader of
this expedition instead of that self-important Coiren, except that
Galina herself had pointed out that a Red might make Rand
al&rsquo;Thor suspicious. The Amyrlin Seat was supposed to be of all
Ajahs and none, renouncing her old loyalty, but if Elaida deferred
to anyone&mdash;which was debatable, true&mdash;she deferred to
Galina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will he come willingly, as Coiren thinks?&rdquo; Katerine
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Galina said dryly. &ldquo;The honor this
delegation does him should be enough to make a king carry his
throne to Tar Valon on his back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katerine did not bother to nod. &ldquo;The woman Sevanna
will kill him, given a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then she must not be given a chance.&rdquo; Galina&rsquo;s
voice was cold, her plump mouth tight. &ldquo;The Amyrlin Seat will not
be pleased to have her plans disrupted. And you and I will have
days to scream in the dark before we die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drawing her shawl up over her shoulders reflexively,
Katerine shuddered. There was dust in the air; she would get out
her light cloak. It would not be Elaida&rsquo;s rage that killed
them, though her fury could be terrible. For seventeen years
Katerine had been Aes Sedai, but not until the morning before they
departed Tar Valon had she learned that she shared more than the
Red Ajah with Galina. Twelve years she had been a member of the
Black Ajah, never knowing that Galina had too, for far longer. Of
necessity Black sisters kept themselves hidden, even from each
other. Their rare gatherings were held with faces covered and
voices disguised. Before Galina, Katerine had known only two to
recognize. Orders were left on her pillow, or in a pocket of her
cloak, the ink ready to vanish if any hand but hers touched the
paper. She had a secret place to leave messages, and dire orders
not to try to see who came to take them. She had never disobeyed.
There might be Black sisters among those following a day behind,
but she had no way of knowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked. Orders to preserve the Dragon
Reborn made no sense, even if they delivered him into Elaida&rsquo;s
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Questions are dangerous for one sworn to obey
without.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katerine shuddered again, and barely stopped herself
from curtsying. &ldquo;Yes, Galina Sedai.&rdquo; But she could not help
wondering. Why?</p>

<br>

<p class="drop"> &ldquo;They show neither respect nor honor,&rdquo; Therava
growled. &ldquo;They allow us to enter their camp as though we were
toothless dogs, then take us out under guard like suspected
thieves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sevanna did not look around. She would not until
safely back among the trees. The Aes Sedai would be watching for
signs of nervousness. &ldquo;They agreed, Therava,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That is
enough for now.&rdquo; For now. One day, these lands would be the
Shaido&rsquo;s for the looting. Including the White Tower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is all badly thought out,&rdquo; the third woman said
in a tight voice. &ldquo;Wise Ones avoid Aes Sedai; it has always been
so. Perhaps it was well enough for you, Sevanna&mdash;as
Couladin&rsquo;s widow, and Suladric&rsquo;s, you speak as clan chief
until we send another man to Rhuidean&mdash;but the rest of us
should be no part of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sevanna barely forced herself to keep walking.
Desaine had spoken against her being chosen as a Wise One, speaking
loudly about her having served no apprenticeship and paid no visit
to Rhuidean, claiming that her place standing for the clan chief
disqualified her. Besides, as the widow of not just one, but two
dead chiefs, perhaps she carried bad luck. Fortunately, enough of
the Shaido Wise Ones had listened to Sevanna, not Desaine. It was
<em>un</em>fortunate that Desaine had too many listeners to be
safely done away with. Wise Ones were supposed to be inviolate&mdash;they even came and went freely among the Shaido from those
betrayers and fools down in Cairhien&mdash;but Sevanna meant to
find a way.</p>

<p>As though Desaine&rsquo;s doubts had infected Therava,
she began muttering, only half to herself. &ldquo;What is ill done is
going against Aes Sedai. We served them before the Breaking, and
failed them; that is why we were sent to the Three-fold Land. If we
fail them again, we will be destroyed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was what everyone believed; it was part of the
old tales, almost part of custom. Sevanna was not so sure. These
Aes Sedai looked weak and foolish to her, traveling with a few
hundred men for escort through lands where the true Aiel, the
Shaido, could smother them with thousands. &ldquo;A new day has come,&rdquo;
she said sharply, repeating part of one of her speeches to the Wise
Ones. &ldquo;We are no longer bound to the Three-fold Land. Any eye can
see that what was, has changed. We must change, or be ended as if
we never were.&rdquo; She had never told them how much change she
intended, of course. The Shaido Wise Ones would never send a man to
Rhuidean, if she had her way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;New day or old day,&rdquo; Desaine grumbled, &ldquo;what are we
to do with Rand al&rsquo;Thor if we do manage to take him from the
Aes Sedai? Better, and easier, to slip a knife between his ribs
while they are escorting him north.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sevanna did not answer. She did not know what to
answer. Not yet. All she knew was that once she had the so-called
<em>Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</em>, the chief of chiefs of all the Aiel,
chained before her tent like a vicious dog, then this land would
truly belong to the Shaido. And to her. She had known that even
before the strange wetlander man somehow found her in the mountains
these people called Kinslayer&rsquo;s Dagger. He had given her a
small cube of some hard stone, intricately carved in strange
patterns, and told her what to do with it, with the aid of a Wise
One who could channel, once al&rsquo;Thor was in her hands. She
carried it in her belt pouch at all times; she had not decided what
to do about it, but so far she had told no one about man or cube.
Head high, she walked on beneath that blistering sun in an autumn
sky.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The palace garden might have had a semblance of
coolness had there been any trees, but the tallest things were
fanciful topiary, tortured into the shapes of running horses or
bears performing tumblers&rsquo; tricks or the like. Shirtsleeved
gardeners scurried about with buckets of water beneath the scalding
afternoon sun, trying to save their creations. They had given up on
the flowers, clearing all the patterned beds and laying them with
sod that was dying too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pity the heat is so bad,&rdquo; Ailron said. Sweeping a
lace handkerchief from the lace-fringed sleeve of his yellow silk
coat, he dabbed delicately at his face, then tossed it aside. A
servant in gold-and-red livery quickly snatched it from the
graveled walk and faded into the background again: another liveried
man laid a fresh replacement in the King&rsquo;s hand to be tucked
up his sleeve. Ailron did not acknowledge it, of course, or even
appear to notice. &ldquo;These fellows usually manage to keep everything
alive till spring, but I may lose a few this winter. Since it
doesn&rsquo;t seem as if we&rsquo;ll have any winter. They take cold
better than drought. Don&rsquo;t you think they&rsquo;re very fine,
my dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ailron, Anointed by the Light, King and Defender of
Amadicia, Guardian of the Southern Gate, was not as handsome as
rumor made him, but then, Morgase had suspected when she first met
him, years ago, that he might be the source of those rumors
himself. His dark hair was full and wavy&mdash;and quite
definitely receding in front. His nose was a bit too long, his ears
a touch too big. His whole face vaguely suggested softness. One day
she would have to ask. The Southern Gate to what?</p>

<p>Working her carved ivory fan, she eyed one of the
gardeners&rsquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;constructs. It seemed to be three huge nude
women wrestling desperately with gigantic serpents. &ldquo;They are quite
remarkable,&rdquo; she said. One said what one must when coming as a
beggar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Yes, aren&rsquo;t they? Ah, it looks as if
affairs of state call me. Pressing matters, I fear.&rdquo; A dozen men,
coated as colorfully as the flowers that were no longer there, had
appeared on the short marble stair at the far end of the walk and
were waiting in front of a dozen fluted columns that supported
nothing. &ldquo;Until this evening, my dear. We will speak further of
your dreadful problems, and what I can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bowed over her hand, stopping just short of
kissing it, and she curtsied slightly, murmuring appropriate
inanities, and then he swept away, followed by all but one of the
coterie of servants that had been trailing them everywhere.</p>

<p>With him gone, Morgase worked the fan harder than she
could in his presence&mdash;the man pretended the heat barely
touched him, with sweat streaming down his face&mdash;and turned
back toward her apartments. Hers by sufferance, just as the pale
blue gown she wore was a gift. She had insisted on the high neck
despite the weather; she had definite ideas about low
necklines.</p>

<p>The lone serving man followed behind her, at a short
distance. And Tallanvor, of course, on her heels and still
insisting on wearing the rough green coat he had traveled here in,
sword on his hip as though he expected an attack in the Seranda
Palace, not two miles from Amador. She tried to ignore the tall
young man, but as usual, he would not be ignored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should have gone to Ghealdan, Morgase. To
Jehannah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had let some things go on far too long. Her
skirts swished as she whirled to confront him, and her eyes blazed.
 &ldquo;On our journey, certain discretions were necessary, but those
around us now know who I am. You will remember that too, and show
proper respect for your Queen. On your knees!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To her shock, he did not move. &ldquo;Are you my Queen,
Morgase?&rdquo; At least he lowered his voice so the servant could not
overhear and spread it about, but his eyes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she very nearly
backed away from the stark desire there. And the anger. &ldquo;I will not
abandon you this side of death, Morgase, but you abandoned much
when you abandoned Andor to Gaebril. When you find it again, I will
kneel at your feet, and you can strike off my head if you choose,
but until then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;we should have gone to Ghealdan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young fool would have been willing to die
fighting the usurper even after she discovered that no House in
Andor would support her, and day by day, week by week since she had
decided her only choice was to seek foreign aid, he had grown more
insolent and insubordinate. She could ask Ailron for
Tallanvor&rsquo;s head, and receive it with no questions asked. But
just because they were unasked did not mean they would be
unthought. She truly was a beggar here, and could not afford to ask
one favor more than absolutely necessary. Besides, without
Tallanvor, she would not be here. She would be a prisoner&mdash;worse than a prisoner&mdash;to Lord Gaebril. Those were the only
reasons Tallanvor would keep his head.</p>

<p>Her army guarded the ornately carved doors to her
apartments. Basel Gill was a pink-cheeked man with graying hair
combed vainly back over a bald spot. His leather jerkin, sewn with
steel discs, strained around his girth, and he wore a sword he had
not touched in twenty years before belting it on to follow her.
Lamgwin was bulky and hard, though heavy-lidded eyes made him look
half-asleep. He wore a sword too, but the scars on his face and a
nose broken more than once made it plain he was used to employing
fists, or a cudgel. An innkeeper and a street tough; aside from
Tallanvor, that was the army she had so far to take back Andor and
her throne from Gaebril.</p>

<p>The pair were all awkward bows, but she glided past
and slammed the door in Tallanvor&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;The world,&rdquo; she
announced in a growl, &ldquo;would be a far better place without
men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An emptier place, certainly,&rdquo; Morgase&rsquo;s old
nurse said from her chair beside a velvet-draped anteroom window.
With her head bent over her embroidery hoop, Lini&rsquo;s gray bun
waggled in the air. A reed-thin woman, she was not nearly so frail
as she looked. &ldquo;I assume Ailron was no more forthcoming today? Or
is it Tallanvor, child? You must learn not to let men put you in a
fret. Fretting makes your face blotchy.&rdquo; Lini still would not admit
that she was out of the nursery, despite having been nurse to
Morgase&rsquo;s daughter in turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ailron was charming,&rdquo; Morgase said carefully. The
third woman in the room, on her knees taking folded bedsheets from
a chest, sniffed loudly, and Morgase avoided glaring at her with an
effort. Breane was Lamgwin&rsquo;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;companion. The short
suntanned woman followed where he went, but she was Cairhienin, and
Morgase was no queen of hers, as she made clear. &ldquo;Another day or
two,&rdquo; Morgase continued, &ldquo;and I think I will get a pledge from him.
Today, he finally agreed I need soldiers from outside to retake
Caemlyn. Once Gaebril is driven from Caemlyn, the nobles will flock
to me once more.&rdquo; She hoped they would; she was in Amadicia because
she had let Gaebril blind her, had mistreated even her oldest
friends among the Houses at his behest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;A slow horse does not always reach the end of
the journey,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Lini quoted, still intent on her embroidery. She was
very fond of old sayings, some of which Morgase suspected her of
making up on the spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This one will,&rdquo; Morgase insisted. Tallanvor was
wrong about Ghealdan; according to Ailron, that country was in near
anarchy because of this Prophet all the servants whispered about,
the fellow preaching the Rebirth of the Dragon. &ldquo;I would like some
punch, Breane.&rdquo; The woman only looked at her until she added, &ldquo;If
you please.&rdquo; Even then she set about the pouring with a wooden
sulkiness.</p>

<p>The mixture of wine and fruit juices was iced, and
refreshing in the heat; the silver goblet felt good against
Morgase&rsquo;s forehead. Ailron had snow and ice brought down from
the Mountains of Mist, though it took nearly a steady stream of
wagons to provide enough for the palace.</p>

<p>Lini took a goblet, too. &ldquo;Concerning Tallanvor,&rdquo; she
began after a sip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave over, Lini!&rdquo; Morgase snapped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So he is younger than you,&rdquo; Breane said. She had
poured for herself, as well. The effrontery of the woman! She was
supposed to be a servant, whatever she had been in Cairhien. &ldquo;If
you want him, take him. Lamgwin says he is sworn to you, and I have
seen him look at you.&rdquo; She laughed huskily. &ldquo;He will not refuse.&rdquo;
Cairhienin were disgusting, but at least most of them kept their
dissolute ways decently hidden.</p>

<p>Morgase was about to order her from the room when a
knock came at the door. Without waiting permission, a white haired
man who looked all sinew and bone entered. His snowy cloak was
emblazoned with a flaring golden sun on the breast. She had hoped
to avoid Whitecloaks until she had Ailron&rsquo;s seal on a firm
agreement. The chill of the wine abruptly passed straight into her
bones. Where were Tallanvor and the others, that he had walked
right in?</p>

<p>Dark eyes going straight to her, he made the most
minimal of bows. His face was aged, the skin drawn tight, but this
man was as feeble as a hammer. &ldquo;Morgase of Andor?&rdquo; he said in a
firm deep voice. &ldquo;I am Pedron Niall.&rdquo; Not just any Whitecloak; the
Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light himself. &ldquo;Do
not fear. I have not come to arrest you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morgase held herself straight. &ldquo;Arrest me? On what
charge? I cannot channel.&rdquo; No sooner were the words out of her
mouth than she nearly clicked her tongue in exasperation. She
should not have mentioned channeling; that she had put herself on
the defensive was an indication of how flustered she was. It was
true, what she had said, so far as it went. Fifty times trying to
sense the True Source to find it once, and when found, twenty times
attempting to open herself to <em>saidar</em> in order to catch a
dribble once. A Brown sister named Verin had told her that there
was hardly any need for the Tower to hold her until she learned to
handle her tiny ability safely. The Tower did anyway, of course.
Still, even that much ability to channel was outlawed in Amadicia,
the penalty death. The Great Serpent ring on her hand that so
fascinated Ailron now seemed hot enough to glow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tower trained,&rdquo; Niall murmured. &ldquo;That is forbidden,
as well. But as I said, I come not to arrest, but to help. Send
your women away, and we will talk.&rdquo; He made himself at home, taking
a tall padded armchair and flipping his cloak over the back. &ldquo;I
will have some of that punch before they go.&rdquo; To Morgase&rsquo;s
displeasure, Breane brought him a goblet immediately, eyes down and
face as expressionless as a board.</p>

<p>Morgase made an effort to take back control. &ldquo;They
stay, Master Niall.&rdquo; She would not give this man the satisfaction
of a title. The lack did not appear to faze him. &ldquo;What has happened
to my men outside? I will hold it against you if they&rsquo;ve been
harmed. And why do you think I need your help?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your men are uninjured,&rdquo; he said dismissively over
his punch. &ldquo;Do you think Ailron will give you what you need? You
are a beautiful woman, Morgase, and Ailron prizes women with
sun-gold hair. He will come a little closer each day to the
agreement you seek, never quite reaching it, until you decide that
perhaps, with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a certain sacrifice, he will yield also. But he
will come no nearer what you want, whatever you give. This
so-called Prophet&rsquo;s mobs ravage the north of Amadicia. To the
west lies Tarabon, with a ten-sided civil war, brigands sworn to
the so-called Dragon Reborn, and rumors of Aes Sedai and the false
Dragon himself to frighten Ailron. Give you soldiers? Could he find
ten men for every one he has under arms now, or even two, he would
mortgage his soul. But I can send five thousand Children of the
Light riding to Caemlyn with you at their head if you but ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To say she was stunned would have been to minimize
Morgase&rsquo;s feeling. She made her way to a chair across from him
with, a proper stateliness, and sat down before her legs gave way.
 &ldquo;Why would you want to help me oust Gaebril?&rdquo; she demanded.
Obviously he knew everything; no doubt he had spies among
Ailron&rsquo;s servants. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never given the Whitecloaks the
free rein they want in Andor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time he grimaced. Whitecloaks did not like that
name. &ldquo;Gaebril? Your lover is dead, Morgase. The false Dragon Rand
al&rsquo;Thor has added Caemlyn to his conquests.&rdquo; Lini made a faint
noise as if she had pricked herself, but he kept his eyes on
Morgase.</p>

<p>For herself, Morgase had to grip the arm of her chair
to keep from pressing a hand against her stomach. If her other hand
had not been resting the goblet on the other chair arm, she would
have slopped punch onto the carpet. Gaebril dead? He had gulled
her, turned her into his doxy, usurped her authority, oppressed the
land in her name, and finally named himself King of Andor, which
had never had a king. How, after all that, could there possibly be
this faint regret that she would never feel his hands again? It was
madness; if she had not known it was impossible, she would have
believed he had used the One Power on her in some way.</p>

<p>But al&rsquo;Thor had Caemlyn now? That might change
everything. She had met him once, a frightened country youth from
the west trying his best to show proper respect for his queen. But
a youth carrying the heron-mark sword of a blademaster. And Elaida
had been wary of him. &ldquo;Why do you call him a false Dragon, Niall?&rdquo;
If he intended to call her by name, he could do without even a
commoner&rsquo;s &ldquo;master.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Stone of Tear has fallen, as the
Prophecies of the Dragon said. The High Lords of Tear themselves
have acclaimed him the Dragon Reborn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Niall&rsquo;s smile was mocking. &ldquo;Everywhere he has
appeared, there have been Aes Sedai. They do his channeling for
him, mark me. He is no more than a puppet of the Tower. I have
friends in many places&rdquo;&mdash;he meant spies&mdash;&ldquo;and they tell
me there&rsquo;s evidence the Tower set up Logain, the last false
Dragon, too. Perhaps he got above himself, so they had to finish
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no proof of that.&rdquo; She was pleased that her
voice was steady. She had heard the rumors about Logain on the way
to Amador. But they were only rumors.</p>

<p>The man shrugged. &ldquo;Believe as you will, but I prefer
truth to foolish fancies. Would the true Dragon Reborn do as he has
done? The High Lords acclaimed him, you say? How many did he hang
before the rest bowed down? He let Aiel loot the Stone, and all of
Cairhien. He says Cairhien shall have a new ruler&mdash;one he
will name&mdash;but the only real power in Cairhien is himself. He
says there will be a new ruler in Caemlyn, too. You are dead; did
you know that? There is mention of the Lady Dyelin, I believe. He
has sat on the Lion Throne, used it for audiences, but I suppose it
was too small, being made for women. He has put it up as a trophy
of his conquest and replaced it with his own throne, in the Grand
Hall of your Royal Palace. Of course, all has not gone well for
him. Some Andoran Houses think he killed you; there&rsquo;s sympathy
for you, now you&rsquo;re dead. He holds what he holds of Andor in
an iron fist, though, with a horde of Aiel and an army of
Borderland ruffians the Tower recruited for him. But if you think
he will welcome you back to Caemlyn and give you back your throne&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He let the words trail off, but the torrent had hit
Morgase like hailstones. Dyelin was next in line for the throne
only if Elayne died without issue. Oh, Light, Elayne! Was she still
safe in the Tower? Strange to think she had such an antipathy for
Aes Sedai, largely because they had lost Elayne for a time, that
she had demanded Elayne&rsquo;s return when no one <em>demanded</em>
anything from the Tower, yet now she hoped they held her daughter
tightly. She remembered one letter from Elayne, after she returned
to Tar Valon. Had there been others? So much of what had happened
while Gaebril held her in thrall was vague. Surely Elayne must be
safe. She should be worried about Gawyn too, and Galad&mdash;the
Light knew where they were&mdash;but Elayne was her heir. Peace in
Andor depended on a smooth succession.</p>

<p>She had to think carefully. It all hung together, yet
well-crafted lies did, and this man would be a master at that
craft. She needed facts. That Andor believed her dead was no
surprise; she had had to sneak from her own realm to avoid Gaebril
and those who might turn her over to him or else avenge
Gaebril&rsquo;s wrongs on her. If sympathy came from it, she could
make use of it when she rose from the dead. Facts. &ldquo;I will need
time to think,&rdquo; she told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Niall rose smoothly; she would have
risen too, so he did not tower over her, but she was not sure her
legs would support her. &ldquo;I will return in a day or two. In the
meantime, I wish to be sure of your safety. Ailron is so wrapped in
his own concerns, there is no telling who might slip in, perhaps
intent on harm. I have taken the liberty of posting a few of the
Children here. With Ailron&rsquo;s consent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morgase had always heard that the Whitecloaks were
the true power in Amadicia, and she was certain she had just heard
proof.</p>

<p>Niall was slightly more formal in his leaving than in
coming, making a bow that might have done for an equal. One way and
another, he was letting her know that she had no choice.</p>

<p>No sooner had he gone than Morgase pushed to her
feet, but Breane was still quicker in darting for the doors. Even
so, before either woman had gone three steps, one of them banged
open, Tallanvor and the other two men spilling into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morgase,&rdquo; Tallanvor breathed, trying to absorb her
with his eyes. &ldquo;I was afraid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Afraid?&rdquo; she said contemptuously. It was too much;
he would not learn. &ldquo;Is this how you protect me? A boy could have
done as much! But then, a boy did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That smoldering gaze remained on her a moment longer;
then he turned and pushed his way past Basel and Lamgwin.</p>

<p>The innkeeper stood wringing his hands. &ldquo;They were at
least thirty, my Queen. Tallanvor would have fought; he tried to
cry out, to warn you, but they clubbed him with a hilt. The old one
said they didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you, but they didn&rsquo;t need
any but you, and if they had to kill us&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; His eyes went to
Lini and Breane, who was staring Lamgwin up and down to make sure
he had taken no injury, The man appeared as concerned for her. &ldquo;My
Queen, if I&rsquo;d thought we could do any good&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m
sorry. I failed you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;The right medicine always tastes bitter,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Lini
murmured softly. &ldquo;Most of all for a child who throws a sulky
tantrum.&rdquo; At least for once she did not say it for the whole room
to hear.</p>

<p>She was right. Morgase knew that. Except about the
tantrum, of course. Basel looked miserable enough to welcome
beheading. &ldquo;You did not fail me, Master Gill. I may ask you to die
for me one day, but only when there&rsquo;s greater good to come of
it. Niall only wanted to talk.&rdquo; Basel perked up right away, but
Morgase could feel Lini&rsquo;s eyes on her. Very bitter. &ldquo;Will you
ask Tallanvor to come to me. I&mdash;I wish to apologize to him
for my hasty words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best way to apologize to a man,&rdquo; Breane said,
 &ldquo;is to trip him in a secluded part of the garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something snapped in Morgase. Before she knew it she
had hurled her goblet at the woman, spraying punch across the
carpet. &ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; she shrieked. &ldquo;All of you, get out! You can
deliver my apologies to Tallanvor, Master Gill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Breane calmly brushed punch from her dress, then took
her time walking to Lamgwin and linking her arm through his. Basel
was all but bouncing on his toes trying to herd them out.</p>

<p>To Morgase&rsquo;s surprise, Lini went, too. That was
not Lini&rsquo;s way; she was much more likely to remain and lecture
her old charge as if she were still ten. Morgase did not know why
she put up with it. Still, she almost told Lini to stay. But then
they were all gone, the door was shut&mdash;and she had more
important matters to worry about than whether Lini&rsquo;s feelings
were bruised.</p>

<p>Pacing across the carpet, she tried to think. Ailron
would demand trade concessions&mdash;and maybe Niall&rsquo;s
 &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo;&mdash;for help. She was willing to give him the trade
concessions, but she feared Niall might be right about how many
soldiers Ailron would spare her. Niall&rsquo;s demands would be
easier to grant, in a way. Probably free access to Andor for as
many Whitecloaks as he chose. And freedom for them to root out the
Darkfriends they found in every attic, to rouse mobs against
friendless women they accused of being Aes Sedai, to kill real Aes
Sedai. Niall might even demand a law against channeling, against
women going to the White Tower.</p>

<p>It would be possible&mdash;but difficult, and bloody&mdash;to oust the Whitecloaks once they entrenched themselves, but
was it necessary to let them in at all? Rand al&rsquo;Thor was the
Dragon Reborn&mdash;she was certain of that no matter what Niall
said; she was almost certain&mdash;yet ruling nations was no part
of the Prophecies of the Dragon that she knew. Dragon Reborn or
false Dragon, he could not have Andor. Yet how was she to know?</p>

<p>A timid scratch at the door brought her around.
 &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said sharply.</p>

<p>The door opened slowly to admit a grinning young man
in gold-and-red livery, a tray in his hands bearing a fresh pitcher
of iced punch, the silver already beading with cold. She had
half-expected Tallanvor. Lamgwin stood guard alone in the corridor,
as far as she could see. Or rather lounged against a wall like a
tavern bouncer. She waved the young man to put his tray down.</p>

<p>Angrily&mdash;Tallanvor should have come; he should
have come!&mdash;she resumed her pacing. Basel and Lamgwin might
hear rumors in the nearest village, but they would be rumors, and
maybe planted by Niall. The same held true for the palace
servants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Queen. May I speak, my Queen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morgase turned in amazement. Those were the accents
of Andor. The young man was on his knees, grin flashing from
uncertain to cocky and back. He might have been good-looking except
that his nose had been broken and not properly tended. On Lamgwin
it looked rugged, if low; this lad looked as if he had tripped and
fallen on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;How did you come
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Paitr Conel, my Queen. From Market Sheran.
In Andor?&rdquo; he added, as if she might not realize that. Impatiently
she motioned him to go on. &ldquo;I came to Amador with my uncle Jen.
He&rsquo;s a merchant from Four Kings, and he thought he might find
some Taraboner dyes. They&rsquo;re dear, with all the troubles in
Tarabon, but he thought they might be cheaper&mdash;&rdquo; Her mouth
tightened, and he went on in a rush. &ldquo;We heard about you, my Queen,
that you were here in the palace, and given the law in Amadicia,
and you being trained in the White Tower and all, we thought we
could help you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He swallowed hard, and finished in a small
voice. &ldquo;Help you escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And are you prepared to help me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;escape?&rdquo; Not
the best plan, but she could always ride north to Ghealdan. How
Tallanvor would gloat. No, he would not, and that would be
worse.</p>

<p>But Paitr shook his head wretchedly. &ldquo;Uncle Jen had a
plan, but now there&rsquo;s Whitecloaks all over the palace. I
didn&rsquo;t know what else to do but come on to you, the way he
told me. He&rsquo;ll think of something, my Queen. He&rsquo;s
smart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he is,&rdquo; she murmured. So Ghealdan went
glimmering again. &ldquo;How long are you gone from Andor? A month? Two?&rdquo;
He nodded. &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know what is happening in Caemlyn,&rdquo;
she sighed.</p>

<p>The young man licked his lips. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;we&rsquo;re
staying with a man in Amador who has pigeons. A merchant. He gets
messages from everywhere. Caemlyn, too. But it&rsquo;s all bad news
that I hear, my Queen. It may take a day or two, but my uncle will
figure out another way. I just wanted to let you know help was
nearby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, that was as might be. A race between Pedron
Niall and this Paitr&rsquo;s uncle Jen. She wished she were not so
sure how to bet. &ldquo;In the meantime, you can tell me just how bad
matters are in Caemlyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Queen, I was just supposed to let you know about
the help. My uncle will be angry if I stay&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>am</em> your Queen, Paitr,&rdquo; Morgase said
firmly, &ldquo;and your uncle Jen&rsquo;s, too. He will not mind if you
answer my questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paitr looked as though he might bolt, but she settled
herself in a chair and began digging for the truth.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Pedron Niall was feeling quite good as he dismounted
in the main courtyard of the Fortress of the Light and tossed his
reins to a stableman. Morgase was well in hand, and he had not had
to lie once. He did not like lying. It had all been his own
interpretation of events, but he was sure of it. Rand al&rsquo;Thor
was a false Dragon and a tool of the Tower. The world was full of
fools who could not think. The Last Battle would not be some
titanic struggle between the Dark One and a Dragon Reborn, a mere
man. The Creator had abandoned mankind to its own devices long ago.
No, when Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don came, it would be as in the Trolloc
Wars two thousand years ago and more, when hordes of Trollocs and
other Shadowspawn poured out of the Great Blight, tore through the
Borderlands and nearly drowned humanity in a sea of blood. He did
not mean to let mankind face that divided and unprepared.</p>

<p>A ripple of bows from white-cloaked Children followed
him through the stone-walled corridors of the Fortress, all the way
to his private audience chamber. In the anteroom, his pinch-faced
secretary, Balwer, leaped to his feet with a fussy recitation of
papers awaiting the Lord Captain&rsquo;s signature, but Niall&rsquo;s
attention was on the tall man who rose easily from one of the
chairs against the wall, a crimson shepherd&rsquo;s crook behind the
golden sun on his cloak and three golden knots of rank below.</p>

<p>Jaichim Carridin, Inquisitor of the Hand of the
Light, looked as hard as he was, but with more gray at his temples
than the last time Niall had seen him. His dark, deep-set eyes held
a tinge of worry, and it was no wonder. The last two missions he
had been given ended in disaster; not auspicious for a man who
aspired to be High Inquisitor one day, and perhaps even Lord
Captain Commander.</p>

<p>Tossing his cloak to Balwer, Niall motioned Carridin
to follow into the audience chamber proper, where captured battle
flags and the banners of old enemies made trophies on the dark
paneled walls and a huge sunburst set into the floor held enough
gold to make most men stare. Aside from that, it was a plain,
soldier&rsquo;s room, a reflection of Niall himself. Niall seated
himself in a high-backed chair, well made but undecorated. The long
twin hearths at either end of the room stood cold and swept at a
time of year when they should have held roaring fires. Proof enough
that the Last Battle was near. Carridin bowed deeply and knelt on
the sunburst, worn smooth by centuries of feet and knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you speculated on why I sent for you,
Carridin?&rdquo; After Almoth Plain and Falme, after Tanchico, the man
could not be blamed if he believed he was to be arrested. But if he
suspected such a possibility, nothing showed in his voice. As
usual, he could not help showing that he knew more than anyone
else. Definitely more than he was supposed to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Aes Sedai in Altara, my Lord Captain Commander.
A chance to wipe out half the Tar Valon witches, right on our
doorstep.&rdquo; An exaggeration; a third were in Salidar, perhaps, but
no more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And have you speculated aloud, among your friends?&rdquo;
Niall doubted that Carridin had any, but there were those he drank
with. Of late, got drunk with. The man had certain skills, though;
useful skills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my Lord Captain Commander. I know better than
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Niall said. &ldquo;Because you are not going
anywhere near this Salidar, and neither is any other of the
Children.&rdquo; He could not be sure whether it was relief that flashed
across Carridin&rsquo;s face. If so, it was out of character; the
man had never shown any lack of courage. And relief certainly did
not suit his reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they are waiting to be snapped up. This is proof
the rumors are true, the Tower is divided. We can destroy this lot
without the others raising a hand. The Tower could be weakened
enough to fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think you so?&rdquo; Niall said dryly. He laced his
fingers across his middle and kept his voice mild. Questioners&mdash;the Hand despised that name, but even he used it&mdash;Questioners never saw anything not shoved under their noses. &ldquo;Even
the Tower can hardly come out openly for this false Dragon
al&rsquo;Thor. What if he turns, as Logain did? But a rebel group?
They could support him, and the White Tower&rsquo;s skirts are clean
whatever happens.&rdquo; He was sure that was the way of it. If not,
there would be ways to use any real split to further weaken the
Tower, but he believed he was right. &ldquo;In any case, what the world
sees, matters. I will not let them see merely a struggle between
the Children and the Tower.&rdquo; Not until the world saw the Tower for
what it was, a sink of Darkfriends meddling with forces mankind was
not meant to touch, the force that had caused the Breaking of the
World. &ldquo;This struggle is the world against the false Dragon
al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then if I am not going to Altara, my Lord Captain
Commander, what are my orders?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Niall let his head fall back with a sigh. He felt
tired suddenly. He felt all of his years and more. &ldquo;Oh, you will be
going to Altara, Carridin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s name and face had been known
to him since shortly after the supposed invasion from across the
sea at Falme, an Aes Sedai plot that had cost the Children a
thousand men and begun the spread of the Dragonsworn and chaos
across Tarabon and Arad Doman. He had known what al&rsquo;Thor was
and believed he could use him as a goad to force the nations to
unite. Once bound together, behind his leadership, they could have
disposed of al&rsquo;Thor and been ready for the Trolloc hordes. He
had sent emissaries to every ruler of every land to point out the
danger. But al&rsquo;Thor moved faster than he could believe even
now. He had meant to let a rabid lion roam the streets long enough
to frighten everyone, but the lion had become a giant that moved
like lightning.</p>

<p>Yet all was not lost; he had to keep reminding
himself. More than a thousand years ago, Guaire Amalasan had named
himself the Dragon Reborn, a false Dragon who could channel.
Amalasan had conquered more land than al&rsquo;Thor now held, before
a young king named Artur Paendrag Tanreall took the field against
him and began his own climb to empire. Niall did not consider
himself another Artur Hawkwing, but he was what the world had. He
would not give up while he lived.</p>

<p>Already he had begun to counter al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s
growing strength. Besides emissaries to rulers, he had sent men to
Tarabon and Arad Doman. A few men to find the right ears, to
whisper that all their troubles could be laid at the feet of the
Dragonsworn, those fools and Darkfriends who had declared for
al&rsquo;Thor. And at the feet of the White Tower. Plenty of rumors
already came out of Tarabon of Aes Sedai involved in the fighting,
rumors to ready men&rsquo;s ears to hear the truth. Now was time to
launch the next part of his new plan, to show the fence-sitters
which side to choose. Time. He had so little time. Yet he could not
help smiling. There were those, now dead, who had once said, &ldquo;When
Niall smiles, he is going for the throat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Altara and Murandy,&rdquo; he told Carridin, &ldquo;are about to
be tormented by a plague of Dragonsworn.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The chamber had the appearance of a palace sitting
room&mdash;vaulted ceiling of worked plaster, finely woven carpets
on the white-tiled floor, elaborately carved paneling for the walls&mdash;though it was far from any palace. Indeed, it was far from
anywhere, in any way that most humans would understand.
Mesaana&rsquo;s russet silk dress rustled as she moved around a
lapis-inlaid table, amusing herself with the placement of ivory
dominoes in a complex tower, each level larger than the one below.
She prided herself on doing this purely with a knowledge of
stresses and leverage, not a thread of the Power. She had the tower
to nine levels.</p>

<p>In truth, more than amusing herself, she was avoiding
conversation with her companion. Semirhage sat doing needlework in
a high-backed chair covered in red tapestry, long slender fingers
deftly making minuscule stitches to form a labyrinthine pattern of
tiny flowers. It was always a surprise that the woman liked an
activity so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ordinary. Her black dress was a sharp contrast
against the chair. Not even Demandred dared suggest to
Semirhage&rsquo;s face that she wore black so often because Lanfear
wore white.</p>

<p>For the thousandth time Mesaana tried to analyze why
she felt uncomfortable around the other woman. Mesaana knew her own
strengths and weaknesses, with the One Power and elsewhere. She
matched well with Semirhage on most points, and where she did not,
she had other strengths to lay against weaknesses in Semirhage. It
was not that. Semirhage took delight in cruelty, a pure pleasure in
giving anguish, but that surely was not the problem. Mesaana could
be cruel where necessary, and she did not care what Semirhage did
to others. There had to be a reason, but she could not find it.</p>

<p>Irritably she placed another domino, and the tower
collapsed with a clatter, spilling ivory tiles onto the floor. With
a click of her tongue, she turned from the table, folding her arms
beneath her breasts. &ldquo;Where is Demandred? Seventeen days since he
went to Shayol Ghul, but he waits until now to inform us of a
message, then does not appear.&rdquo; She had been to the Pit of Doom
twice in that time herself, made that nerve-racking walk with the
stone fangs brushing her hair. To find nothing except a strange
too-tall Myrddraal that would not speak. The Bore had been there,
certainly, but the Great Lord had not answered. She did not remain
long either time. She had thought herself beyond fear, at least the
sort a Halfman&rsquo;s gaze brought, but twice the Myrddraal&rsquo;s
silent eyeless stare had sent her away with quickening steps that
only tight self-control kept from becoming a run. Had channeling
there not been a sure way to die, she would have destroyed the
Halfman, or Traveled from the Pit itself. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Semirhage raised her eyes from her stitchery,
unblinking dark eyes in a smooth dark face, then put aside the
needlework and stood gracefully. &ldquo;He will come when he comes,&rdquo; she
said calmly. She was always calm, just as she was always graceful.
 &ldquo;If you do not want to wait, then go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unconsciously Mesaana raised herself a little on her
toes, but she still had to look up. Semirhage stood taller than
most men, though so perfectly proportioned that you did not realize
it until she stood over you, looking down. &ldquo;Go? I <em>will</em> go.
And he can&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no warning, of course. There never was,
when a man channeled. A bright vertical line appeared in the air,
then widened as the gateway turned sideways to open long enough for
Demandred to step through, giving them each a small bow. He was all
in dark gray today, with a little pale lace at his neck. He adapted
easily to the fashions and fabrics of this Age.</p>

<p>His hawk-nosed profile was handsome enough, though
not quite the sort to make every woman&rsquo;s heart beat faster. In
a way, &ldquo;almost&rdquo; and &ldquo;not quite&rdquo; had been the story of
Demandred&rsquo;s life. He had had the misfortune to be born one day
after Lews Therin Telamon, who would become the Dragon, while Barid
Bel Medar, as he was then, spent years almost matching Lews
Therin&rsquo;s accomplishments, not quite matching Lews
Therin&rsquo;s fame. Without Lews Therin, he would have been the
most acclaimed man of the Age. Had he been appointed to lead
instead of the man he considered his intellectual inferior, an
overcautious fool who too often managed to scrape up luck, would he
stand here today? Now, that was idle speculation, though she had
made it before. No, the important point was that Demandred despised
the Dragon, and now that the Dragon had been Reborn, he had
transferred that contempt whole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Demandred raised a hand. &ldquo;Let us wait until we are
all here, Mesaana, and I will not have to repeat myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She felt the first spinning of <em>saidar</em> a
moment before the glowing line appeared and became a gateway.
Graendal stepped out, for once unaccompanied by half-clad servants,
and let the opening vanish as quickly as Demandred had. She was a
fleshy woman with elaborately curled red-gold hair. Somewhere she
had actually managed to find streith for her high-necked gown.
High-necked, but mirroring her mood&mdash;the fabric was
transparent mist. At times Mesaana wondered whether Graendal really
took note of anything beyond her sensual pleasures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wondered whether you would be here,&rdquo; the new
arrival said lightly. &ldquo;You three have been so secretive.&rdquo; She gave
a gay, slightly foolish laugh. No, it would be a dire mistake to
take Graendal at surface value. Most who had taken her for a fool
were long since dead, victims of the woman they disregarded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Sammael coming?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Graendal waved a beringed hand dismissively. &ldquo;Oh, he
doesn&rsquo;t trust you. I don&rsquo;t think the man trusts himself
anymore.&rdquo; The streith darkened; a concealing fog. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
marshaling his armies in Illian, moaning over not having
shocklances to arm them. When he isn&rsquo;t doing that, he&rsquo;s
searching for a usable <em>angreal</em> or
<em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>. Something of decent strength, of
course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their eyes all went to Mesaana, and she drew a deep
breath. Any of them would have given&mdash;well, almost anything,
for a suitable <em>angreal</em> or <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>. Each
was stronger than any of these half-trained children who called
themselves Aes Sedai today, but enough half-trained children linked
together could crush them all. Except, of course, that they no
longer knew how, and no longer had the means in any case. Men were
needed to take a link beyond thirteen, more than one to go beyond
twenty-seven. In truth, those girls&mdash;the oldest seemed girls
to her; she had lived over three hundred years, quite aside from
her time sealed in the Bore, and had only been considered just into
her middle years&mdash;those girls were no real danger, but that
did not lessen the desire of anyone here for <em>angreal</em>, or
better yet the more powerful <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>. With those
remnants from their own time, they could channel amounts of the
Power that would have burned them to ash without. Any of them would
risk much for one of those prizes. But not everything. Not with no
real need. That lack did not still the desire, though.</p>

<p>Automatically Mesaana dropped into a lecturing tone.
 &ldquo;The White Tower now has guards <em>and</em> wards on their
strongrooms, inside and out, plus they count <em>everything</em>
four times each day. The Great Hold in the Stone of Tear is also
warded, with a nasty thing that would have held me fast had I tried
to pass through or untie it. I don&rsquo;t think it can be untied
except by whoever wove it, and until then it is a trap for any
other woman who can channel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dusty jumble of useless rubbish, so I&rsquo;ve
heard,&rdquo; Demandred said in dismissal. &ldquo;The Tairens gathered anything
with even a rumored connection to the Power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mesaana suspected he had more than hearsay to go on.
She also suspected there was a trap for men woven around the Great
Hold, too, or Demandred would have had his <em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em>
and launched himself at Rand al&rsquo;Thor long since. &ldquo;No doubt
there are some in Cairhien and Rhuidean, but even if you do not
walk right into al&rsquo;Thor, both are full of women who can
channel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ignorant girls,&rdquo; Graendal sniffed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If a kitchen girl puts a knife in your back,&rdquo;
Semirhage said coolly, &ldquo;are you less dead than if you fall in a
sha&rsquo;je duel at Qal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mesaana nodded. &ldquo;That leaves whatever might lie
buried in ancient ruins or forgotten in an attic. If you want to
count on finding something by chance, do so. I will not. Unless
someone knows the location of a stasis box?&rdquo; There was a certain
dryness to that last. The stasis boxes should have survived the
Breaking of the World, but that upheaval had likely as not left
them on the bottom of an ocean or buried beneath mountains. Little
remained of the world they had known beyond a few names and
legends.</p>

<p>Graendal&rsquo;s smile was all sweetness. &ldquo;I always
thought you should be a teacher. Oh, I am sorry. I forgot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mesaana&rsquo;s face darkened. Her road to the Great
Lord began when she was denied a place in the Collam Daan all those
years ago. Unsuited for research, they had told her, but she could
still teach. Well, she had taught, until she found how to teach
them all!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am still waiting to hear what the Great Lord
said,&rdquo; Semirhage murmured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Are we to kill al&rsquo;Thor?&rdquo; Mesaana realized
she was gripping her skirt with both hands and let go. Strange. She
never let anyone get under her skin. &ldquo;If all goes well, in two
months, three at most, he will be where I can safely reach him, and
helpless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you can safely reach him?&rdquo; Graendal arched an
eyebrow quizzically. &ldquo;Where <em>have</em> you made your lair? No
matter. Bare as it is, it&rsquo;s as good a plan as I&rsquo;ve heard
lately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still Demandred kept silent, stood there studying
them. No, not Graendal. Semirhage and her. And when he did speak,
half to himself, it was to they two. &ldquo;When I think where you two
have placed yourselves, I wonder. How much has the Great Lord
known, for how long? How much of what has happened has been at his
design all along?&rdquo; There was no answer to that. Finally, he said,
 &ldquo;You want to know what the Great Lord told me? Very well. But it
stays here, held close. Since Sammael chose to stay away, he learns
nothing. Nor do the others, whether alive or dead. The first part
of the Great Lord&rsquo;s message was simple. &#145;Let the Lord of
Chaos rule.&rsquo; His words, exact.&rdquo; The corners of his mouth
twitched, as close to a smile as Mesaana had ever seen from him.
Then he told them the rest.</p>

<p>Mesaana found herself shivering and did not know
whether she did so from excitement or fear. It could work; it could
hand them everything. But it required luck, and gambling made her
uncomfortable. Demandred was the gambler. He was right about one
thing; Lews Therin had made his own luck as a mint made coin. In
her opinion it seemed that so far Rand al&rsquo;Thor did the
same.</p>

<p>Unless&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;unless the Great Lord had a plan beyond
the one he had revealed. And that frightened her more than any
other possibility.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">The gilt-framed mirror reflected the room, the
disturbingly patterned mosaics on the walls, the gilded furnishings
and fine carpets, the other mirrors and the tapestries. A palace
room without a window&mdash;or a door. The mirror reflected a
woman striding up and down in a dark blood-red gown, her beautiful
face a combination of rage and disbelief. Still, disbelief. It
reflected his own face, too and that interested him far more than
the woman. He could not resist touching his nose and mouth and
cheeks for the hundredth time to make sure they were real. Not
young, but younger than the face he had worn on first waking from
the long sleep, with all its endless nightmares. An ordinary face,
and he had always hated being ordinary. He recognized the sound in
his throat as a budding laugh, a giggle, and stifled it. He was not
mad. Despite everything, he was not that.</p>

<p>A name had been given to him during this second, far
more horrific sleep, before he woke to this face and body.
Osan&rsquo;gar. A name given by a voice he knew and dared not
disobey. His old name, given in scorn and adopted in pride, was
gone forever. The voice of his master had spoken and made it so.
The woman was Aran&rsquo;gar; who she had been, was no more.</p>

<p>Interesting choices, those names.
<em>Osan&rsquo;gar</em> and <em>aran&rsquo;gar</em> were the left and
right-hand daggers in a form of dueling briefly popular early in
that long building from the day the Bore had been made to the
actual beginning of the War of Power. His memories were spotty&mdash;too much had been lost in the long sleep, and the short&mdash;but he remembered that. The popularity had been brief
because almost inevitably both duelists died. The daggers&rsquo;
blades were coated with slow poison.</p>

<p>Something blurred in the mirror, and he turned, not
too quickly. He had to remember who he was, and make sure others
remembered. There still was no door, but a Myrddraal shared the
room with them. Neither thing was strange in this place, but the
Myrddraal stood taller than any Osan&rsquo;gar had seen before.</p>

<p>He took his time, letting the Halfman wait to be
acknowledged, and before he could open his mouth, Aran&rsquo;gar
spat, &ldquo;Why has this been done to me? Why have I been put into this
body? Why?&rdquo; The last was almost a shriek.</p>

<p>Osan&rsquo;gar would have thought the Myrddraal&rsquo;s
bloodless lips twitched in a smile, except that was impossible,
here or anywhere. Even Trollocs had a sense of humor, if a vile and
violent one, but not Myrddraal. &ldquo;You were both given the best that
could be taken in the Borderlands.&rdquo; Its voice was a viper rustling
in dry grass, &ldquo;It is a fine body, strong and healthy. And better
than the alternative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both things were true. It was a fine body, suitable
for a <em>daien</em> dancer in the old days, sleekly lush, with a
green-eyed ivory oval of a face to match, framed by glossy black
hair. And anything bettered the alternative.</p>

<p>Perhaps Aran&rsquo;gar did not see it that way. Rage
mottled that beautiful face. She was going to do something
reckless. Osan&rsquo;gar knew it; there had always been a problem in
that regard. Lanfear seemed cautious by contrast. He reached for
<em>saidin</em>. Channeling here could be dangerous, but less than
allowing her to do something truly stupid. He reached for
<em>saidin</em>&mdash;and found nothing. He had not been shielded;
he would have felt it, and known how to work around or break it,
given time, if it was not too strong. This was as if he had been
severed. Shock petrified him where he stood.</p>

<p>Not so for Aran&rsquo;gar. Perhaps she had made the
same discovery, but it affected her differently. With a screech
like a cat she launched herself at the Myrddraal, fingernails
clawed.</p>

<p>A futile attack, of course. The Myrddraal did not
even shift its stance. Casually it caught her by the throat, raised
her straight-armed till her feet left the floor. The screech became
a gurgle, and she grabbed the Halfman&rsquo;s wrist with both hands.
With her dangling in its grasp, it turned that eyeless stare to
Osan&rsquo;gar. &ldquo;You have not been severed, but you will not channel
until you are told you may. And you will never strike at me. I am
Shaidar Haran.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Osan&rsquo;gar tried to swallow, but his mouth was
dust. Surely the creature had nothing to do with whatever had been
done to him. Myrddraal had powers of a sort, but not that. Yet it
knew. He had never liked Halfmen. He had helped make the Trollocs,
blending human and animal stock&mdash;he was proud of that, of the
skill involved, the difficulty&mdash;but these occasional
throwback offspring made him uneasy at the best of times.</p>

<p>Shaidar Haran turned its attention back to the woman
twitching in its fist. Her face was beginning to go purple, and her
feet kicked feebly. &ldquo;You will adapt. The body bends to the soul,
but the mind bends to the body. You are adapting already. Soon it
will be as if you had never had any other. Or you may refuse. Then
another will take your place, and you will be given to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;my
brothers, blocked as you are.&rdquo; Those thin lips twitched again.
 &ldquo;They miss their sport in the Borderlands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She cannot speak,&rdquo; Osan&rsquo;gar said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
killing her! Don&rsquo;t you know who we are? Put her down, Halfman!
Obey me!&rdquo; The thing had to obey one of the Chosen.</p>

<p>But the Myrddraal impassively studied
Aran&rsquo;gar&rsquo;s darkening face for a long moment more before
letting her feet touch the carpet and loosening its grip. &ldquo;I obey
the Great Lord. No other.&rdquo; She hung on, wavering, coughing and
gulping air. Had it taken its hand away, she would have fallen.
 &ldquo;Will you submit to the will of the Great Lord?&rdquo; Not a demand, just
a perfunctory question in that rasping voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I will,&rdquo; she managed hoarsely, and Shaidar
Haran let her go.</p>

<p>She swayed, massaging her throat, and Osan&rsquo;gar
moved to help her, but she threatened him with a glare and a fist
before he touched her. He backed away with raised hands. That was
one enmity he did not need. But it was a fine body, and a fine
joke. He had always prided himself on his sense of humor, but this
was rich.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you not feel gratitude?&rdquo; the Myrddraal said. &ldquo;You
were dead, and are alive. Think of Rahvin, whose soul is beyond
saving, beyond time. You have a chance to serve the Great Lord
again, and absolve yourselves of your errors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Osan&rsquo;gar hastened to assure it that he was
grateful, that he wanted nothing more than to serve and gain
absolution. Rahvin dead? What had happened? No matter; one fewer of
the Chosen meant one more chance for true power when the Great Lord
was free. It abraded, humbling himself before something that could
be said to be as much his creation as the Trollocs, but he
remembered death too clearly. He would grovel before a worm to
avoid that again. Aran&rsquo;gar was no less quick, he noted, for
all the anger in her eyes. Clearly, she remembered too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it is time for you to go into the world once
more in the service of the Great Lord,&rdquo; Shaidar Haran said. &ldquo;None
but I and the Great Lord know you live. If you succeed, you will
live forever and be raised above all others. If you fail&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but
you will not fail, will you?&rdquo; The Halfman did smile then. It was
like seeing death smile.</p>
