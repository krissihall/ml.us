Egwene, Rand&rsquo;s visit to Cairhien seemed like
one of those grand Illuminators&rsquo; fireworks displays she had
heard of but never seen, exploding all through the city. The echoes
seemed to reverberate without end.</p>

<p>She did not go near the palace again, of course, but
Wise Ones that went every day to search for traps laid with <em>
saidar</em> told her what went on. Nobles stared at one another
with slitted eyes, Tairen and Cairhienin alike. Berelain seemed to
have gone into hiding, refusing to see anyone she did not have to;
Rhuarc apparently took her to task for neglecting her duties, with
small effect. He appeared to be the only one unaffected in the
whole palace. Even the servants jumped if you looked at them,
though that might just have been having the Wise Ones themselves
poking into every corner.</p>

<p>In the tents, things were no better, among the Wise
Ones anyway. The rest of the Aiel were like Rhuarc, calm and solid.
Their attitude made the Wise Ones&rsquo; moodiness even more tense
by comparison, not that it needed any. Amys and Sorilea came back
from meeting Rand all but hissing. They did not say why, not where
Egwene could hear, but the feeling spread through the Wise Ones as
fast as thought, until every one of them stalked about like a
bristling cat ready to claw anything that moved. Their apprentices
stepped lightly and spoke softly, but still were scolded for what
would have passed without notice before, and punished for what
would have brought only a scolding.</p>

<p>Shaido Wise Ones appearing in the camp did not help.
At least, Therava and Emerys were Wise Ones; the third was Sevanna
herself, striding around self-importantly with her blouse unlaced
enough to rival Berelain no matter how the dust blew. Therava and
Emerys said Sevanna was a Wise One, and though Sorilea grumbled,
there was no choice but to accept her as one. Egwene was sure they
were spying, but Amys merely looked at her when she suggested it.
Protected by custom, they had a free run of the tents, welcomed by
all the Wise Ones&mdash;even Sorilea&mdash;as if close friends or
first-sisters. Still, their presence honed the edge of
everyone&rsquo;s mood. Especially Egwene&rsquo;s. That smirking cat
Sevanna knew who she was, and took no pains to hide her delight in
sending &ldquo;the short apprentice girl&rdquo; to fetch a cup of water or the
like at any opportunity. Sevanna looked at her, too, a studying
sort of gaze. It made Egwene think of someone studying a chicken,
thinking how to cook it after they stole it. Worse than that, the
Wise Ones would not tell her what they talked about; it was Wise
Ones&rsquo; business, and none of apprentices&rsquo;. For whatever
reason the Shaido were there, the mood among the other Wise Ones
certainly interested them; more than once Egwene saw Sevanna, when
she thought herself unobserved, smile as she watched Amys or
Malindhe or Cosain stalk by talking to herself and needlessly
adjusting her shawl. No one listened to Egwene, of course. Too many
comments about the Shaido women finally earned her most of a day
spent digging a hole &ldquo;deep enough to stand in without being seen,&rdquo;
and when she climbed out, all sweat and filth to begin filling it
in, Sevanna was watching.</p>

<p>Two days after Rand left, Aeron and some other Wise
Ones talked three Maidens into sneaking over the wall of
Arilyn&rsquo;s palace in the night to see what they could scout out,
and that made everything worse. The three avoided Gawyn&rsquo;s
guards, if with more difficulty than they expected, but the Aes
Sedai were another matter; while they were still climbing from the
roof into an attic, they were wrapped up in the Power and whisked
inside. Fortunately Coiren and the others seemed to think they were
there to steal, though the Maidens might not have thought it was so
fortunate. They were tossed into the street, so bruised they could
hardly walk and still struggling not to sniffle when they got back
to the tents. The other Wise Ones took turns upbraiding Aeron and
her friends, usually in private, though Sorilea appeared to make a
point of confronting them before as many people as possible.
Sevanna and her two companions sneered quite openly whenever they
saw Aeron or one of the others, and speculated among themselves in
very audible voices about what the Aes Sedai would do when they
found out. Even Sorilea looked at them askance for that, but no one
said anything, and Aeron and her friends began walking as small as
the apprentices. The apprentices began trying to hide when not
actually performing their duties or taking lessons. Sharp tempers
became like razors.</p>

<p>Except for her hole, Egwene managed to avoid the
worst of it, but only because she stayed away from the tents a good
deal, largely to stay clear of Sevanna before she taught the woman
a lesson. She had no doubt how that would end; Sevanna was accepted
as a Wise One, no matter how many grimaces there might be when she
was not around. Amys and Bair would probably let the Shaido woman
set her punishment. At least staying away was not too difficult.
She might be an apprentice, but only Sorilea made any effort to
teach her the thousand things a Wise One had to know. Until Amys
and Bair gave her final permission to return to <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, her days and nights were largely her
own, so long as she managed to escape being snapped up with
Surandha and the rest to wash dishes or gather dung for the fires
or the like.</p>

<p>She could not understand why the days seemed to pass
so slowly; she thought it must be waiting on Amys and Bair. Gawyn
was at The Long Man every morning. She became used to the fat
innkeeper&rsquo;s suggestive smirks, though once or twice she did
think of kicking the woman. Maybe three times; no more than that.
Those hours went by in a flash. No sooner did she sit on his knee
than it was time to straighten her hair and leave. Sitting on his
knee no longer frightened her. Not that it had ever frightened her,
exactly, but it had come to be more than pleasant. If she sometimes
thought things she should not have, if those thoughts made her
blush, well, he always brushed her face with his fingers when she
blushed, and said her name in a way she could have spent a lifetime
hearing. He let slip less about what was going on with the Aes
Sedai than she learned elsewhere, and she could hardly make herself
care.</p>

<p>It was the other hours that dragged out as though
mired in mud. There was so little to do that she thought she might
burst from frustration. Wise Ones keeping watch on Arilyn&rsquo;s
mansion reported no more Aes Sedai. Chosen from those who could
channel, the watchers said the Aes Sedai were still wielding the
Power inside day and night without break, but Egwene did not dare
go close, and if she had, she could have not told what they were
doing without seeing the flows. Had the Wise Ones been less
snappish, she might have tried to spend time reading in her tent,
but the one time she touched a book except at night by lamplight,
Bair muttered so about girls wasting their days lying about lazily
that Egwene murmured that she had forgotten something and scurried
out of the tent before she was found something more useful to do. A
few moments&rsquo; conversation with another apprentice could be as
dangerous. Stopping to talk with Surandha, who was hiding in the
shade cast by a tent belonging to some Stone Dogs, earned her an
afternoon doing laundry when Sorilea found them. She might actually
have been glad of chores, just for something to do, but Sorilea
examined the perfectly clean wash hung inside the tent to keep off
the ever-present dust, sniffed and told them to do it again. Twice
she told them to do it again! Sevanna watched part of that too.</p>

<p>Being in the city always made Egwene look over her
shoulder, yet on the third day, she picked her way down to the
docks as cautiously as a mouse stealing from a cat. A wizened
fellow with a narrow little boat scratched his thinning hair and
demanded a silver mark to row her out to the Sea Folk ship.
Everything was dear, but that was ridiculous. She fixed him with a
level stare, told him he could have a silver penny&mdash;still
far too much, really&mdash;and hoped the bargaining would not
take her whole purse; she did not have much. Everybody jumped and
flinched at the Aiel, but when it came to bargaining, they forgot
all about <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em> and spears and fought like lions.
He opened his toothless mouth, closed it, peered at her, then
muttered under his breath and to her surprise told her she was
stealing the bread out of his mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get in,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;Get in. I cannot waste all
day for a pittance. Browbeating a man. Stealing the bread.&rdquo; He went
on like that even after he began working the oars, pulling the tiny
boat out onto the broad waters of the Alguenya.</p>

<p>Egwene did not know whether Rand had met this
Wavemistress, but she hoped he had. According to Elayne, the Dragon
Reborn was the Sea Folk Coramoor, the Chosen One, and all he had to
do was appear to have them running at his beck and call. She hoped
they did not grovel too much, though. Rand got more than enough of
that already. Still, it was not Rand that sent her out with the
muttering boatman. Elayne had actually met some of the Atha&rsquo;an
Miere, had traveled on one of their ships, and she said Sea Folk
Windfinders could channel. Some of them anyway; maybe most. That
was a secret the Atha&rsquo;an Miere held close, but the Windfinder
on Elayne&rsquo;s vessel had been more than willing to share her
knowledge once her secret was penetrated. Sea Folk Windfinders knew
weather. Elayne claimed they knew more of weather than the Aes
Sedai. She said the Windfinder on her ship had worked enormous
flows to produce favorable winds. Egwene had no idea how much of
that was true and how much enthusiasm, but learning a little about
weather would certainly be better that twiddling her thumbs and
wondering whether being caught by Nesune might be a relief from the
Wise Ones and Sevanna. With what she knew now, she could not have
made it rain if the skies were black except for lightning. At the
moment, of course, the sun burned golden in a cloudless sky and
heat shimmers danced over the dark water. At least the dust did not
make it far onto the river.</p>

<p>When the boatman finally drew in his oars and let the
small craft drift beside the ship, Egwene stood up, ignoring his
mutters that she would have them both in the river. &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; she
called. &ldquo;Hello? May I come aboard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had been on several riverboats and was proud that
she knew the right terms&mdash;shipfolk seemed touchy about the
right words&mdash;but this vessel was outside her experience. She
had seen river craft longer, a few, but none so tall. Some of the
crew were in the rigging, or clambering up the slanted masts, dark
bare-chested men, barefoot in wide, colorful trousers held up by
bright sashes, dark women in bright blouses as well.</p>

<p>She was just at the point of shouting again, louder,
when a rope ladder uncoiled down the side of the ship. No answering
call came from the deck, yet that seemed invitation enough. Egwene
climbed. It was difficult&mdash;not the climb, but keeping her
skirts decently close; she could see why the Sea Folk women wore
trousers&mdash;but finally she reached the rail.</p>

<p>Immediately her eyes fell on a woman not a span away
on the deck. Her blouse and trousers were blue silk, with a darker
sash. She wore three worked gold rings in each ear, and a fine
chain that supported tiny glittering medallions ran from one to a
ring in her nose. Elayne had described this, and even demonstrated
using <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, but seeing it in the flesh
made Egwene wince. But there was something else. She could sense
the ability to channel. She had found the Windfinder.</p>

<p>She opened her mouth, and a dark hand flashed in
front of her eyes with a gleaming dagger. Before she could scream,
the blade sliced through the ropes of the ladder. Still clinging to
the useless thing, she plummeted.</p>

<p>She did scream then&mdash;for all of a heartbeat,
before she went into the river feet first, plunging deep. Water
rushed into her open mouth, drowning her scream; she thought she
swallowed half the river. Frantically she struggled to unwrap her
skirts from around her head and rid herself of the ladder. She was
not in a panic. She was not. How far down had she gone? It was all
muddy darkness around her. Which way was up? Iron bands gripped her
chest, but she breathed out through her nose, watched the bubbles
stream, as it seemed to her, down and to her left. Twisting, she
stroked for the surface. How far? Lungs burning.</p>

<p>Her head broke through into daylight, and she sucked
in air with a coughing gasp. To her surprise, the boatman reached
down and hauled her into his boat by increments, muttering at her
to stop thrashing before she upset them, adding that Sea Folk were
a touchy lot. He leaned over again to reclaim her shawl before it
sank once more. She snatched it from him, and he shied back as if
he thought she meant to hit him with it. Her skirts hung heavily,
her blouse and shift clung; her head scarf slanted across her
forehead. A pool began to form in the bottom of the boat under her
feet.</p>

<p>The boat had drifted maybe twenty paces from the
ship. The Windfinder was at the railing now, and two more women,
one in plain green silk, the other brocaded red worked with gold
thread. Their earrings and nose rings and chains caught the
sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are refused the gift of passage,&rdquo; the green-clad
woman called, and the one in red shouted, &ldquo;Tell the others,
disguises do not fool us. You do not frighten us. You are all
refused the gift of passage!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wizened boatman picked up his oars, but Egwene
pointed a finger straight at his narrow nose. &ldquo;Stop right where you
are.&rdquo; He stopped. Dunking her. Not a word of common courtesy.</p>

<p>Drawing a deep breath, she embraced <em>saidar</em>
and channeled four flows before the Windfinder could react. So she
knew weather, did she? Could she divide her flows four ways? Not
many Aes Sedai could. One flow was Spirit, a shield she shoved onto
the Windfinder to keep her from interfering. If she knew how. Each
of the other three was Air, woven almost delicately around each
woman, binding her arms to her sides. Lifting them was not
precisely difficult, but not easy either.</p>

<p>A clamor rose on the ship as the women floated into
the air and out over the river. Egwene heard the boatman moaning.
She was not interested in him. The three Sea Folk women did not
even kick. With an effort she hoisted them higher, some ten or
twelve paces above the surface; no matter how hard she strained,
that seemed to be the limit. <em>Well, you don&rsquo;t want to
actually hurt them</em>, she thought, and released the weaves. <em>
They&rsquo;ll scream now</em>.</p>

<p>The Sea Folk women curled into balls as soon as they
began to fall, spun, straightened with their arms thrust out before
them. They entered the water with three quite small splashes.
Moments later three dark heads broke the surface, and the women
began swimming rapidly back toward the ship.</p>

<p>Egwene closed her mouth. <em>If I haul them up by
their ankles and dunk their heads, they&rsquo;ll</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;what was
she thinking? They had to scream because she had? She was no wetter
than they. <em>I must look like a drowned rat!</em> She channeled
carefully&mdash;working about yourself always took care; you could
not see the flows clearly&mdash;and water rolled off her, oozed
out of her garments. It made quite a puddle.</p>

<p>It was the boatman staring at her, mouth hanging open
and eyes wide, that made her realize what she had done. Channeled,
in the middle of the river, with nothing to hide her from any Aes
Sedai who happened to be where she could see. Sun or no sun, she
suddenly felt cold to the bone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may take me back to shore now.&rdquo; No telling who
was on the docks; at this distance she could not tell a man from a
woman. &ldquo;Not to the city. The riverbank.&rdquo; The fellow flung himself
against his oars so hard she almost fell over backward.</p>

<p>He took her to a spot where the shore was all smooth
rocks the size of her head. There was no one in sight, but she
leaped out as soon as the boat grated onto the rocks, hoisted her
skirts and darted up the sloping bank at a dead run she maintained
all the way back to her tent where she collapsed in a panting pile
of sweat. She did not go near the city again. Except to meet Gawyn,
of course.</p>

<p>The days passed, and the now almost ceaseless wind
carried waves of dust and grit day and night. On the fifth night,
Bair accompanied Egwene into the World of Dreams, just a quick
jaunt in the nature of a test, a walk in the part of <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> that Bair knew best, the Aiel Waste,
a parched jagged land that made even drought-torn Cairhien seem
lush and fair. A quick trip, and then Bair and Amys came to wake
her and see whether it had had any ill effect. It had not. No
matter how they made her run and jump, no matter how often they
peered into her eyes and listened to her heart, they agreed, but
agreement or not, the next night Amys took her for another short
trip to the Waste, followed by another examination that made her
glad to crawl onto her pallet and fall into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>Those two nights she did not return to the World of
Dreams, but it was more exhaustion than anything else. Before that
she had told herself every night she should stop&mdash;a fine
thing if she was caught violating their strictures just when they
were ready to lift them&mdash;but somehow she always decided that
just a short trip would be all right, quick enough to reduce the
chance of exposure. One thing she did avoid was the place between
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> and the waking world, the place
where dreams floated. Especially she avoided it after she found
herself thinking that if she was very careful she might be able to
peek into Gawyn&rsquo;s dreams without being drawn in, and that even
if she was pulled in, it would only be a dream. She reminded
herself firmly that she was a grown woman, not a silly girl. She
was just glad no one else knew what a snarl the man made of her
thoughts. Amys and Bair would laugh till they cried.</p>

<p>On the seventh night, she prepared herself for bed
carefully, putting on a fresh shift and brushing her hair till it
shone. All useless so far as <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> was
concerned, but it kept her from thinking about how her stomach was
doing backflips. Tonight it would be Aes Sedai waiting in the Heart
of the Stone, not Nynaeve or Elayne. That should make no
difference, unless&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the ivory-backed hairbrush froze in
mid-stroke. Unless one of the Aes Sedai revealed that she was only
Accepted. Why had she not thought of that before? Light, but she
wished she could talk with Nynaeve and Elayne. Only, she could not
see what good it would do, and she was certain that dream of
breaking things meant something would go badly wrong if she did
speak to them.</p>

<p>Chewing her lip, she considered going to Amys and
telling her she was not feeling well. Nothing serious, just an
upset stomach, but she did not think she could visit the dream
tonight. They were going to start her lessons again after
tonight&rsquo;s meeting, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;another lie, and a coward&rsquo;s
way to boot. She would not be a coward. Not everyone could be as
brave as everyone else, but cowardice was despicable. Whatever
happened tonight, she had to make herself face it, and that was
that.</p>

<p>Firmly she put down the brush, blew out the lamp and
crawled onto her pallet. She was tired enough that falling asleep
presented no problem, though if necessary she knew how to put
herself to sleep at any time now, or enter a light trance where she
could be in the World of Dreams and still talk&mdash;well, mumble&mdash;to someone waiting by her body. The last thing before sleep
came, she realized something surprising. Her stomach was not
turning over anymore.</p>

<p>She stood in a great vaulted chamber forested with
thick columns of polished redstone. The Heart of the Stone, in the
Stone of Tear. Gilded lamps hung from chains overhead. Unlit, but
there was of course light, coming from everywhere and nowhere. Amys
and Bair were already there, looking no different than they had
that morning, except that all their necklaces and bracelets
sparkled a bit more than even gold really should have. They were
talking quietly, and looking irritated. Egwene caught only a word
here and there, but two of them were &ldquo;Rand al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly she realized she was wearing an
Accepted&rsquo;s white dress with the banded hem. As soon as she
did, it became a copy of the Wise Ones&rsquo; garb, without jewelry.
She did not think the other two women had noticed, or would know
what the dress meant if they did. There were times when surrender
lost less <em>ji</em> and earned less <em>toh</em> than the
alternatives, but no Aiel would ever consider it without even
trying to fight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are late again,&rdquo; Amys said wryly, walking out
into the open space beneath the chamber&rsquo;s great dome. Driven
into the floorstones there was what appeared to be a sword made of
crystal, <em>Callandor</em> of prophecy, a male <em>
sa&rsquo;angreal</em> and one of the most powerful ever made. Rand
had put it there to remind the Tairens of him, as if there was any
chance of them forgetting, but Amys barely glanced at it. To others
The Sword That Is Not a Sword might be a symbol of the Dragon
Reborn; to her, it was a wetlander concern. &ldquo;At least we can hope
they will not try to pretend they know everything and we nothing.
They were much better, last time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bair&rsquo;s snort would have made Sorilea blink.
 &ldquo;They will never be better. The least they can do is be where they
said they would be when they said they&mdash;&rdquo; She cut off as
seven women appeared suddenly on the other side of <em>
Callandor</em>.</p>

<p>Egwene recognized them, including the young woman
with the determined blue eyes she had seen before in <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. Who was she? Amys and Bair had
mentioned the others&mdash;usually in acid tones&mdash;but never
another. She wore a blue-fringed shawl; they all wore their shawls.
Their dresses changed color and cut from moment to moment, but the
shawls never flickered.</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s eyes focused immediately on
Egwene. The Wise Ones might as well not have existed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egwene al&rsquo;Vere,&rdquo; Sheriam said formally, &ldquo;you
are summoned before the Hall of the Tower.&rdquo; Her tilted green eyes
shone with some suppressed emotion. Egwene&rsquo;s stomach sank;
they knew she had been masquerading as a full sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask not why you are summoned,&rdquo; Carlinya said right
behind Sheriam, her icy voice making the formality even harder. &ldquo;It
is yours to answer, not to question.&rdquo; For some reason she had cut
her dark hair short; that was the sort of unimportant detail that
seemed to loom large in Egwene&rsquo;s mind. She certainly did not
want to think about what this all meant. The ceremonious phrases
rolled on in a stately rhythm. Amys and Bair adjusted their shawls
and frowned, their irritation beginning to turn to concern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Delay not in your coming.&rdquo; Egwene had always thought
Anaiya kindly, but the bluff-faced woman sounded as firm as
Carlinya, and not all that much warmer in her formality. &ldquo;It is
yours to obey in haste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three spoke in unison. &ldquo;It is well to fear the
summons of the Hall. It is well to obey in haste and humility,
unasking. You are summoned to kneel before the Hall of the Tower
and accept their judgment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Egwene controlled her breathing, at least enough that
she managed not to pant. What was the penalty for what she had
done? Not light, she suspected, not if all this ceremony went with
it. They were all staring at her. She tried to read something on
those Aes Sedai faces. Six showed only ageless serenity, with maybe
a hint of intensity in the eyes. The young Blue had the cool
calmness of one who had been Aes Sedai for years, but she could not
hide a slight, satisfied smile.</p>

<p>They seemed to be waiting for something. &ldquo;I will come
as soon as I can,&rdquo; she said. Maybe her stomach was down in her
ankles, but she could match them with her voice. No cowardice. She
<em>would</em> be Aes Sedai. If they let her, after this. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know how quickly, though. It&rsquo;s a long way, and I do
not know exactly where Salidar is. Just somewhere along the River
Eldar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheriam exchanged glances with the others. Her dress
went from pale blue silk to dark gray, with divided skirts. &ldquo;We are
sure there is a way to make the journey quickly. If the Wise Ones
will help. Siuan is sure it will require no more than a day or two
if you enter <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> physically&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Bair snapped at the same instant Amys said, &ldquo;We
will not teach her such a thing. It was used for evil, it is evil,
and whoever does it loses part of themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot be sure of this,&rdquo; Beonin said patiently,
 &ldquo;since it seems none of you have ever done it. But if you know of
it, you must have some notion of how it is done. We may be able to
work out what you do not know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patience was exactly the wrong tone. Amys settled her
shawl and stood up even straighter than usual. Bair planted fists
on hips with a glare that showed teeth. In a moment there was going
to be one of those eruptions the Wise Ones had hinted at. They were
going to teach these Aes Sedai a few lessons about what could be
done in <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> by way of showing them
how little they knew. The Aes Sedai faced them quite calmly, full
of confidence. Their shawls held steady, but their dresses
flickered almost as fast as Egwene&rsquo;s heartbeat. Only the young
Blue&rsquo;s garb had any semblance of holding, changing just once
during that long silence.</p>

<p>She had to stop it. She had to go to Salidar, and it
certainly would help nothing if she came as witness to the
humiliation of these Aes Sedai. &ldquo;I know how. I think I do. I&rsquo;m
willing to try.&rdquo; If it did not work, she could always ride. &ldquo;But I
still have to know where. Better than I do now, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amys and Bair turned their attention from the Aes
Sedai to her. Not even Carlinya could have equaled those cold
stares, or Morvrin. Egwene&rsquo;s heart sank after her stomach.</p>

<p>Sheriam immediately began giving directions&mdash;so
many miles west of this village, so many leagues south of that&mdash;but the young Blue cleared her throat and said, &ldquo;This may be
more help.&rdquo; The voice sounded familiar, but Egwene could not
connect it to the face.</p>

<p>Perhaps she had little better control of her clothing
than the others&mdash;soft green silk became deep blue as she
spoke, a high, embroidered neck became a lace ruff in the Tairen
style, a cap of pearls appeared on her head&mdash;but she did know
something of <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>. Suddenly a large
map hung in the air to one side, with a glowing red dot at one end
labeled &ldquo;Cairhien&rdquo; in large letters and another as &ldquo;Salidar&rdquo; at the
other. The map began to expand and change; suddenly the mountains
were not just lines, but raised up, the forests took on shades of
green and brown, the rivers glittered like blue water in sunlight.
It grew until it made a wall hiding the entire side of the Heart.
It was like looking down on the world.</p>

<p>Even the Wise Ones were impressed enough to ignore
their disapproval, at least until the woman&rsquo;s Tairen gown
turned to yellow silk with a silver-embroidered neckline. The young
woman was not interested in them, though. For some reason she
stared challengingly at the other Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is splendid, Siuan,&rdquo; Sheriam said after a
moment.</p>

<p>Egwene blinked. Siuan? It must be a woman of the same
name. This younger Siuan gave a self-satisfied sniff and a sharp
nod very reminiscent of Siuan Sanche, but that was impossible. <em>
You&rsquo;re just trying to put it off</em>, she told herself
firmly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly enough for me to find Salidar,
whether or not I can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She glanced at Amys and Bair, so full
of silent disapproval they could have been carved of winter stone.
 &ldquo;Whether or not I can come here in the flesh. One way or another, I
promise I will be in Salidar as soon as I can.&rdquo; The map vanished.
<em>Light, what are they going to do to me?</em></p>

<p>Her mouth half-formed the question, and Carlinya cut
her off sharply, deep in the ceremony again and even harder than
before. &ldquo;Ask not why you are summoned. It is yours to answer, not
to question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Delay not in your coming,&rdquo; Anaiya said. &ldquo;It is yours
to obey in haste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai exchanged glances and vanished so
quickly she half-wondered whether they thought she would ask
anyway.</p>

<p>That left her alone with Amys and Bair, but when she
turned to them, uncertain whether to begin with an explanation or
an apology or just a plea for understanding, they vanished too,
leaving her there alone, surrounded by the redstone columns, with
<em>Callandor</em> glittering beside her. There <em>were</em> no
excuses in <em>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</em>.</p>

<p>Exhaling sadly, she stepped out of <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> back to her sleeping body.</p>

<p>She woke immediately; waking when you wished was as
much a part of a dreamwalker&rsquo;s training as going to sleep when
you wished, and she had promised to go as quickly as she could.
Channeling, she lit the lamps, all of them. She would need light.
She made an effort to be brisk as she knelt beside one of the small
chests that stood against the walls of the tent and began digging
out clothes she had not worn since going to the Waste. A part of
her life was over, but she would not cry over the loss. She would
not.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">As soon as Egwene disappeared, Rand stepped out from
among the columns. He came here sometimes, to look at <em>
Callandor</em>. The first visit had been after Asmodean taught him
to invert his weaves. Then he had changed the traps laid around the
<em>sa&rsquo;angreal</em> so only he could see them. If the
Prophecies could be believed, whoever drew it out would &ldquo;follow
after&rdquo; him. He was not sure how much he did believe any longer, but
there was no sense taking chances.</p>

<p>Lews Therin rumbled somewhere in the back of his head&mdash;he always did when Rand came close to <em>Callandor</em>&mdash;but tonight the gleaming crystal sword interested Rand not
at all. He stared at where the huge map had hung. Not really a map,
there at the end, but something more. What was this place? Was it
simple chance that drew him here tonight instead of yesterday, or
tomorrow? One of his <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em> tugs on the Pattern? No
matter. Egwene had accepted that summons meekly, and that she would
never do if it came from the Tower and Elaida. This Salidar was
where her mysterious friends were hiding. Where Elayne was. They
had handed themselves to him.</p>

<p>Laughing, he opened a gateway to the reflection of
the Palace in Caemlyn.</p>
