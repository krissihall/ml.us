<h4><em>A Sudden Chill</em></h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he
blazing sun still climbed behind him, and Mat was
glad his broad-brimmed hat gave a little shade on his face. This
Altaran forest was winter-bare and more than winter-brown, with
pines and leatherleafs and other evergreens looking sere, and oak
and ash and sweetgum naked. Noon yet to come, the worst heat beyond
that, and already the day was like riding through an oven. His coat
was slung atop his saddlebags, but sweat made his fine linen shirt
cling. Pips&rsquo; hooves crunched on dead ferns and fallen leaves
thick atop the leaf mold, and the Band moved in a crackle from the
forest floor. Few birds appeared, quick flashes between the
branches, and not a squirrel. There were flies, though, and
bitemes, as if this were the heart of summer instead of less than a
month to the Feast of Lights. No different from what he had seen
back on the Erinin, really, but finding it here too made him
uneasy. Was the whole world really burning up?</p>

<p>Aviendha strode along beside Pips with her bundle on
her back, apparently unconcerned by dying trees or biting flies,
and making considerably less noise than the horse despite her
skirts. Her eyes scanned the surrounding trees as though she did
not trust the Band&rsquo;s scouts and flankers to keep them out of
an ambush. She had not accepted a ride once, which he had not
expected anyway, seeing how Aiel felt about riding, but she had
made no trouble either, unless sharpening her knife every time they
halted could be considered provocative. There had been the incident
with Olver, of course. Riding the high-stepping gray gelding Mat
had found him among the remounts, Olver kept a wary eye on her. He
had tried to stick his belt knife in her the second night, shouting
about Aiel killing his father. Of course, she only took it away
from him, but even after Mat cuffed him and tried to explain the
difference between Shaido and other Aiel&mdash;something Mat was
not all that sure he understood himself&mdash;Olver glared at her
constantly. He did not like Aiel. For Aviendha&rsquo;s part, Olver
seemed to make her uneasy, which Mat did not understand at all.</p>

<p>The trees stood tall enough to have allowed a breeze
to stir under the sparse canopy overhead, but the Red Hand banner
hung limp, and so did the two he had dug out once Rand put them
through that gateway into a night-covered meadow, a Dragon banner,
the red-and-gold shape hidden in white folds, and one of those the
Band called Al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s Banner, the ancient Aes Sedai
symbol also thankfully wrapped inside. A grizzled senior bannerman
had the Red Hand, a fellow with narrow eyes and more scars than
Daerid who insisted on actually carrying the banner a part of each
day, which few bannermen did. Talmanes and Daerid had supplied
second squadmen for the other two, fresh-faced young men who had
shown themselves steady enough for a little responsibility.</p>

<p>Three days they had come across Altara, three days in
forest without sight of a single Dragonsworn&mdash;or anyone else
for that matter&mdash;and Mat hoped to stretch their loneliness at
least through this fourth before reaching Salidar. Aside from Aes
Sedai, there was the problem of how to keep Aviendha from
Elayne&rsquo;s throat. He had few doubts why she kept sharpening
that knife; the edge glittered like gemstones. He was very much
afraid he was going to end taking the Aiel woman to Caemlyn under
guard, with the bloody Daughter-Heir demanding he hang her every
step of the way. Rand and his bloody women! In Mat&rsquo;s view,
anything that slowed the Band and kept him from the stew he
expected in Salidar was to the good. Halting early and marching
late helped. So did the supply wagons at the rear, slow as they
were in the forest. But the Band could ride only so slowly. All too
soon Vanin was sure to find something.</p>

<p>As if thinking his name had been a summons, the fat
scout appeared through the trees ahead with four riders. He had
gone out before dawn with six.</p>

<p>Mat raised a clenched fist, signaling a halt, and
murmurs passed down the column. His first order on leaving the
gateway had been &ldquo;no drums, no trumpets, no flutes and no bloody
singing,&rdquo; and if there had been a few glum faces in the beginning,
after the first day in that wooded terrain, where you could never
see clearly more than a hundred paces and seldom so far, no one
objected at all.</p>

<p>Resting his spear across his saddle, Mat waited
until Vanin pulled up and casually knuckled his forehead. &ldquo;You
found them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The balding man leaned to one side in his saddle to
spit through a gap in his teeth. He was sweating so much he looked
to be melting. &ldquo;I found them. Eight or ten miles west. There&rsquo;s
Warders in those woods. I saw one take Mar; just came out nothing
in one of those cloaks and swept him out of the saddle. Roughed him
considerably, but didn&rsquo;t kill him, though. I expect Ladwin
didn&rsquo;t show up for the same reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they know we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; Mat breathed heavily
through his nose. He did not expect either man would hold back
anything from Warders, much less Aes Sedai. But then, the Aes Sedai
had to know sooner or later. He had just wanted it to be later. He
slapped at a bluefly, but it buzzed away leaving a spot of blood on
his wrist. &ldquo;How many?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vanin spat again. &ldquo;More than I ever figured to see. I
got into the village afoot, and there was Aes Sedai faces all over.
Two, three hundred, maybe. Maybe four. I didn&rsquo;t want to be too
obvious, counting.&rdquo; Before that shock had time to settle, the man
delivered another. &ldquo;They got an army, too. Camped to the north,
mainly. More than you got. Maybe twice as many.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Talmanes and Nalesean and Daerid had ridden up during
that, sweating and swatting flies and bitemes. &ldquo;Did you hear?&rdquo; Mat
asked, and they nodded soberly. His battle luck was all very well,
yet being outnumbered two to one, with hundreds of Aes Sedai thrown
into the bargain, could strain any luck. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t here to
fight,&rdquo; he reminded them, but their long faces remained. For that
matter, the remark did not make him feel better either. What
counted was whether the Aes Sedai wanted this army of theirs to
fight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prepare the Band to be attacked,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;Clear
as much ground as you can, and use the logs to make barricades.&rdquo;
Talmanes grimaced nearly as hard as Nalesean; they liked to be in
the saddle and moving when they fought. &ldquo;Think. There may be
Warders watching us right now.&rdquo; He was surprised to see Vanin nod
and glance off to their right in a significant way, &ldquo;If they see us
readying to defend, then plainly we don&rsquo;t mean to attack. It
might make them decide to leave us alone, and if it doesn&rsquo;t,
at least we&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo; That got through, to Talmanes faster
than Nalesean. Daerid had been nodding from the start.</p>

<p>Giving his oiled beard a twist, Nalesean muttered,
 &ldquo;What do you intend to do then? Just sit and wait for them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re going to do,&rdquo; Mat told
him. <em>Burn Rand and his &ldquo;maybe fifty Aes Sedai&rdquo;! Bum him and his
 &ldquo;loom a little; intimidate them</em>&rdquo;! Waiting right there until
somebody came out from the village to ask who they were and what
they wanted seemed a very good idea. No <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>
twisting this time. Any battle was going to have to come to him; he
was not about to walk into it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are that way?&rdquo; Aviendha said, pointing. Without
waiting for an answer, she settled her bundle on her back and began
striding west.</p>

<p>Mat stared after her. <em>Bloody Aiel</em>. Some
Warder would probably try to take her too, and have his head handed
to him. Or maybe not, Warders being Warders; if she tried to put a
knife in one of those, he might just hurt her. Besides which, if
she got to Elayne and began hair-pulling over Rand, or worse, stuck
a knife in <em>her</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she was moving along quickly, almost
trotting, eager to reach Salidar. <em>Blood and bloody
ashes!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Talmanes, you have the command until I get back, but
you don&rsquo;t stir unless somebody jumps on the Band with both
boots. These four will tell you what you might have to face. Vanin,
you&rsquo;re with me. Olver, stay close to Daerid, in case he needs
messages carried. You can teach him to play Snakes and Foxes,&rdquo; he
added with a grin at Daerid. &ldquo;He tells me he&rsquo;d like to learn.&rdquo;
Daerid&rsquo;s jaw dropped, but Mat had already moved on. A fine
thing if he ended up hauled into Salidar by a Warder with a lump on
his head. How to reduce the chance of that? The banners caught his
eye. &ldquo;You stay here,&rdquo; he told the grizzled bannerman. &ldquo;You other
two come with me. And keep those things furled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His strange little party caught up to Aviendha
quickly. If anything could convince the Warders to let them through
unhindered, one look should. No threat in a woman and four men, and
obviously making no effort to avoid notice, not carrying two
banners. He checked the second squadmen. There was still no breeze,
but they held the banners clutched to the staffs. Their faces were
tight. Only a fool would want to ride in among Aes Sedai and have
those spread in a sudden breeze.</p>

<p>Aviendha glanced at him sideways, then tried to push
his boot out of the stirrup. &ldquo;Let me up,&rdquo; she ordered curtly.</p>

<p>Why under the Light did she want to ride now? Well,
he was not going to have her scrambling up and very likely knocking
him out of the saddle in the process; he had seen Aiel get on a
horse once or twice.</p>

<p>Slapping another fly, he leaned down and caught her
hand. &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; he said, and heaved her up behind him with a
grunt. She was nearly as tall as he was, and solid to boot. &ldquo;Just
put your arm around my waist.&rdquo; She only gave him a look and twisted
about awkwardly until she sat astride, legs bared above the knee
and not at all concerned with it. Nice legs, but he would not have
involved himself with another Aiel woman even if she was not
moonstruck over Rand.</p>

<p>After a time, she spoke to his back. &ldquo;The boy, Olver.
The Shaido killed his father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat nodded without looking around at her. Would he
even see any Warders before it was too late? Leading the way, Vanin
rode slumped like a sack of suet as always, but he had a sharp eye
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His mother died of hunger?&rdquo; Aviendha asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, or maybe sickness.&rdquo; Warders wore those cloaks
that could blend into anything. You could walk past one without
seeing him. &ldquo;Olver wasn&rsquo;t too clear, and I didn&rsquo;t press
him. He buried her himself. Why? Do you think you owe him something
since Aiel cost him his family?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Owe?&rdquo; She sounded startled. &ldquo;I killed neither, and
if I had, they were treekillers. How would I have <em>toh</em>?&rdquo; Without a pause she went on as if continuing in the
same line. &ldquo;You do not care for him properly, Mat Cauthon. I know
men know nothing about raising children, but he is too young to
spend all of his time with grown men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat did look at her then, and blinked. She had her
headkerchief off and was busily running a polished greenstone comb
through her dark reddish hair. That seemed to be taking all her
concentration. That and not falling off. She had donned an
intricately worked silver necklace, too, and a wide bracelet of
carved ivory.</p>

<p>Shaking his head, he went back to studying the
forest. Aiel or not, they were all alike in some ways. <em>If the
world is ending, a woman will want time to fix her hair. If the
world&rsquo;s ending, a woman will take time to tell a man something
he&rsquo;s done wrong</em>. It would have been enough to make him
chuckle if he was not so busy wondering whether Warders were
watching him right that moment.</p>

<p>The sun climbed to its zenith and tipped over by the
time the forest gave way abruptly. Fewer than a hundred paces of
cleared ground separated trees from village, and the ground looked
as if it had not been cleared long. Salidar itself was a
considerable village of gray stone buildings and thatched roofs,
and the streets were full and busy. Mat shrugged into his coat; the
finest green wool, embroidered with gold on cuffs and tall collar,
it should be good enough to meet Aes Sedai in. He left it hanging
open, though; even for Aes Sedai he would not die from heat.</p>

<p>No one tried to stop him as they rode in, but people
paused and every eye turned to him and his strange little company.
They knew, all right. Everyone knew. He gave up counting Aes Sedai
faces after reaching fifty; that number was reached too
quickly for any peace of mind. There were no soldiers in the crowd,
unless you counted Warders, some in those color-shifting cloaks,
some fingering a sword hilt as they watched him pass. No soldiers
in the village simply meant they were all in the camps Vanin had
mentioned. And all the soldiers being in the camps meant they were
ready to do something. Mat hoped Talmanes was holding to his
instructions. Talmanes had some sense, but he could be almost as
eager to go off and charge somebody as Nalesean. He would have left
Daerid in charge&mdash;Daerid had seen too many battles to be
eager&mdash;but the noblemen would never have stood for it. There
did not seem to be any flies in Salidar, either. <em>Maybe they
know something I don&rsquo;t</em>.</p>

<p>A woman caught his eye, a pretty woman in odd
clothes, wide yellow trousers and a short white coat, her golden
hair in an elaborate braid to her waist. She was carrying a bow, of
all things. Not many women took up the bow. She saw him looking and
ducked down a narrow alleyway. Something about her tickled his
memory, but he could not say what. That was one trouble with all
those old memories; he was always seeing people who reminded him of
somebody who turned out to be a thousand years dead when he finally
figured it out. Maybe he had even really seen somebody who looked
like her. Those holes in what he remembered of his own life were
fuzzy around the edges. <em>Probably another Hunter for the
Horn</em>, he thought wryly, and put her out of his head.</p>

<p>There was no point in riding about until somebody
spoke, because it seemed nobody was going to. Mat reined in and
nodded to a thin, dark-haired woman who looked up at him, coolly
questioning. Pretty, but too skinny for his taste even without that
ageless face. Who wanted to be poked by bones every time you gave a
hug? &ldquo;My name is Mat Cauthon,&rdquo; he said neutrally. If she
wanted bowing and scraping, she could take a leap, but
antagonizing her would just be foolish. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for
Elayne Trakand and Egwene al&rsquo;Vere. And Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara,
I suppose.&rdquo; Rand had not mentioned her, but she had gone off with
Elayne, he knew.</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai blinked in surprise, yet serenity
returned in a flash. She studied him and the others one by one,
pausing on Aviendha, then looked at the squadmen so long Mat
wondered whether she could see the Dragon and the black-and-white
disc through the folded cloth. &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; she said finally. &ldquo;I
will see whether the Amyrlin Seat can see you.&rdquo; Gathering her
skirts, she started up the street.</p>

<p>As Mat heeled Pips to follow, Vanin let his dun drop
back and muttered, &ldquo;Asking Aes Sedai for anything is never a good
notion. I could have shown you where to go.&rdquo; He jerked his head
toward a three-story stone cube ahead. &ldquo;They call it the Little
Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat shrugged uneasily. The Little Tower? And they had
somebody here they called the Amyrlin Seat? He doubted the woman
had meant Elaida. Rand was wrong again. This lot were not
frightened. They were too puffed-up crazy to be frightened.</p>

<p>In front of the stone cube, the skinny Aes Sedai said
peremptorily, &ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo; and vanished inside.</p>

<p>Aviendha slipped to the ground, and Mat followed
quickly, ready to grab her if she tried to dart away. Even if it
cost him a little blood he was not going to let her run off and
slit Elayne&rsquo;s throat before he even had a chance to talk to
this so-called Amyrlin. But she only stood there, staring straight
ahead with hands folded at her waist and shawl looped over her
elbows. She looked completely at her ease, but he thought she might
well be terrified out of her skull. If she had any sense, she was.
They had collected a crowd.</p>

<p>Aes Sedai had begun gathering, closing them in
against the front of their Little Tower, silently peering at him,
and the arc of women thickened the longer he stood there. Actually,
they seemed to peer at Aviendha as much as him, but he felt all of
those cool, unreadable gazes. He barely stopped himself from
fingering the silver foxhead hanging beneath his shirt.</p>

<p>A plain-faced Aes Sedai pushed to the front of the
crowd, leading a slender young woman in white, with big eyes. He
vaguely remembered Anaiya, but she hardly seemed interested in him
at all. &ldquo;Are you sure, child?&rdquo; she asked the novice.</p>

<p>The young woman&rsquo;s mouth tightened slightly, but
she certainly let no irritation into her voice. &ldquo;He still seems to
glow, or shine. I really do see it. I just don&rsquo;t know
why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anaiya gave her a delighted smile. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s <em>
ta&rsquo;veren</em>, Nicola. You&rsquo;ve uncovered your first
Talent. You can see <em>ta&rsquo;veren</em>. Now back to the class
with you. Quickly. You don&rsquo;t want to fall behind.&rdquo; Nicola
bobbed a curtsy and, with a last glance at Mat, burrowed away
through the encircling Aes Sedai.</p>

<p>Anaiya turned her gaze on him then, one of those Aes
Sedai gazes that were meant to unsettle a man. It unsettled him
right enough. Of course some Aes Sedai knew about him&mdash;some
knew a good deal more than he could wish, and come to think it, he
seemed to remember that Anaiya was one of those&mdash;but having
things announced that way, in front of the Light knew how many
women with those cool Aes Sedai eyes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;his hands stroked the
carved haft of his spear. Foxhead or no foxhead, there were enough
of them to simply lay hands on him and carry him off. <em>Bloody
Aes Sedai! Bloody Rand!</em></p>

<p>He only held Anaiya&rsquo;s interest for a moment,
though. Stepping up to Aviendha, she said, &ldquo;And what is your name,
child?&rdquo; Her tone was pleasant, but it expected an answer and no
delay about it.</p>

<p>Aviendha faced her squarely, a head taller and using
every hair of it. &ldquo;I am Aviendha, of the Nine Valleys sept of the
Taardad Aiel.&rdquo; Anaiya&rsquo;s mouth quirked toward a smile at the
note of defiance.</p>

<p>Mat wondered who was going to win that staring match,
but before he could make a bet with himself, another Aes Sedai
joined them, a woman whose bony-cheeked face gave an impression of
age despite smooth cheeks and glossy brown hair. &ldquo;Do you be aware
you can channel, girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Aviendha said curtly and snapped her mouth
shut as if intending to say no more. She concentrated on adjusting
her shawl, but she had said enough. Aes Sedai swarmed in around
her, crowding Mat away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How old are you, child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have developed much strength, but you could
learn very much as a novice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do many Aiel girls die of a wasting sickness when
they are a few years younger than you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You really should&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve appeared in the doorway so suddenly she
seemed to pop out of the air. Planting her fists on her hips, she
stared at Mat. &ldquo;What are you doing here, Matrim Cauthon? How did
you get here? I suppose it&rsquo;s too much to hope you have
anything to do with this army of Dragonsworn that&rsquo;s about to
descend on us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; he said dryly, &ldquo;I am in command.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&rdquo; Nynaeve stood there with her mouth open,
then gave herself a shake, tugging at her blue dress as if it had
been disarrayed. It was cut lower than anything he remembered
seeing her wear before, low enough to show cleavage, with yellow
scrollwork around the neckline and hem. Altogether different from
what she had worn back home. &ldquo;Well, come with me,&rdquo; she said
sharply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you to the Amyrlin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat Cauthon,&rdquo; Aviendha called, a touch breathily.
She was looking over and around Aes Sedai to find him. &ldquo;Mat
Cauthon.&rdquo; Just that, but for an Aiel, she looked frantic.</p>

<p>The Aes Sedai surrounding her kept right on, voices
calm, reasonable and relentless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For you, the best thing, it is to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must consider&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much the best&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can hardly think of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mat grinned. She might pull her knife in a moment,
but in that crowd he doubted it would do her much good. She would
not be hunting up Elayne any time soon, that was for sure.
Wondering whether he would return to find her wearing a white
dress, he tossed his spear up to Vanin. &ldquo;Lead on, Nynaeve.
Let&rsquo;s see this <em>Amyrlin</em> of yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave him a tight frown and led him inside tugging
at her braid and muttering only partly to herself. &ldquo;This is
Rand&rsquo;s doing, isn&rsquo;t it? I know it is. Somehow it is.
Frightening everybody half out of their wits. You just watch your
step, <em>Lord General</em> Cauthon, or I swear you will wish
I&rsquo;d caught you stealing blueberries again. Frightening
people! Even a man should have more sense! You stop that grinning,
Mat Cauthon. I do not know what she&rsquo;s going to make of
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were Aes Sedai at the tables inside&mdash;it
had the feel of a common room to him, even with those careful Aes
Sedai scribbling or handing out orders&mdash;but they hardly more
than glanced at him and Nynaeve as they crossed the room. It only
went to show what a raree-show they were running here. An Accepted
stalking through muttering to herself, and not a one of those Aes
Sedai said a word. He had stayed in the Tower as short a time as he
could manage, but he knew that was not the way Aes Sedai ran
things.</p>

<p>At the rear of the room, Nynaeve pushed open a door
that had seen better days. Everything in the place seemed to have
seen better days. Mat followed her in&mdash;and stopped dead.
There was Elayne, pretty as anything with that golden hair, but
playing at the grand lady with every inch of her, in green silk
with a high lace neck, and one of those condescending smiles, and
raised eyebrows. And there was Egwene, seated behind a table, a
questioning smile on her face. And a seven-striped stole over her
pale yellow dress. Taking a quick peek outside, he shoved the door
to before any of the Aes Sedai could see in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you think this is funny,&rdquo; he growled, crossing
the bit of carpet as fast as he could step, &ldquo;but they&rsquo;ll have
your hide if they find out. They&rsquo;ll <em>never</em> bloody let
you go, any of you, if they&mdash;&rdquo; Snatching the stole from
Egwene&rsquo;s neck, he hauled her hurriedly out of the chair&mdash;and the silver foxhead went dead cold against his chest.</p>

<p>Giving Egwene a small shove away from the table, he
glared at them. Egwene only looked puzzled, but Nynaeve&rsquo;s
mouth was hanging open again, and Elayne&rsquo;s big blue eyes
looked ready to pop out onto the floor. One of them had tried to
use the Power on him. The only good thing that had come out of his
trip into that <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> was the foxhead medallion.
He supposed it had to be a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> too, but he
was grateful for it just the same. So long as it touched his skin,
the One Power could not reach him. Not <em>saidar</em>, anyway; he
had more proof of that than he cared for. It did go cold when
someone tried, though.</p>

<p>Tossing the stole and his hat onto the table, he sat
down, then hiked up from the seat to pull out some cushions and
throw them on the floor. He rested a boot on the edge of the table
and regarded the fool women. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need those cushions if
this so-called Amyrlin finds out about this little joke of
yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mat,&rdquo; Egwene began in a firm voice, but he cut her
off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! If you wanted to talk, you should have talked
instead of lashing out with your bloody Power. Now you can
listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo; Elayne said wonderingly. &ldquo;The
flows just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;vanished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At almost the same instant, Nynaeve said in a
threatening tone, &ldquo;Mat Cauthon, you are making the biggest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said listen!&rdquo; He poked a finger at Elayne. &ldquo;You,
I&rsquo;m taking back to Caemlyn, if I can keep Aviendha from
killing you. If you don&rsquo;t want that pretty throat slit, you
stay close to me and do what I say, no questions!&rdquo; The finger
shifted to Egwene. &ldquo;Rand says he&rsquo;ll send you back to the Wise
Ones whenever you want, and if what I&rsquo;ve seen so far is any
indication what you get up to, my advice is to take him up on it
<em>now</em>! It seems you know how to Travel&rdquo;&mdash;Egwene gave a
small start&mdash;&ldquo;so you can make a gateway to Caemlyn for the
Band. I don&rsquo;t want any argument, Egwene! And you, Nynaeve! I
ought to leave you here, but if you want to come, you can. Only,
I&rsquo;m warning you. You yank that braid at me just once, and I
swear I&rsquo;ll warm your bottom!&rdquo; They were staring at him as if
he had sprouted horns like a Trolloc, but at least they were
keeping their mouths shut. Maybe he had managed to get a little
sense into their heads. Not that they would ever thank him for
saving their hides. Oh, no; not them. As usual, they would say they
would have worked everything out for themselves in just a little
while longer. If a woman told you you were interfering when you
pulled her out of a dungeon, what would she not say?</p>

<p>He drew a deep breath. &ldquo;Now. When the poor blind fool
they&rsquo;ve chosen out for their Amyrlin gets here, I will do the
talking. She can&rsquo;t be very bright, or they&rsquo;d never have
been able to shove her into the job. Amyrlin Seat for a bloody
village in the middle of bloody nowhere. You keep your mouths shut
and curtsy for all you&rsquo;re worth, and I&rsquo;ll pull your bacon
off the coals again.&rdquo; They just stared. Good. &ldquo;I know all about her
army, but I have one too. If she&rsquo;s crazy enough to think she
can take the Tower away from Elaida&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, she probably
won&rsquo;t risk any losses just to hold on to you three. You make
that gateway, Egwene, and I will have you in Caemlyn tomorrow, the
next day latest, and these madwomen can run off and get themselves
killed by Elaida. Maybe you&rsquo;ll have some company. They cannot
all be mad. Rand&rsquo;s willing to offer sanctuary. A curtsy, a
quick oath of fealty, and he&rsquo;ll keep Elaida from putting their
heads on pikes in Tar Valon. They can&rsquo;t ask better than that.
Well? Anything to say?&rdquo; They did not even blink as far as he could
see. &ldquo;A simple &lsquo;Thank you, Mat&rsquo; would do.&rdquo; Not a word.
Not a blink.</p>

<p>A timid tap on the door was followed by a novice, a
pretty green-eyed girl who dropped a deep curtsy, all wide-eyed
awe. &ldquo;I was sent to see if you wanted anything, Mother. For the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the general, I mean. Wine, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;or. &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Tabitha.&rdquo; Egwene pulled the striped stole from
under his hat and settled it on her shoulders. &ldquo;I want to talk with
<em>General</em> Cauthon alone a little longer. Tell Sheriam I will
send for her shortly, to advise me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Close your mouth before you catch flies, Mat,&rdquo;
Nynaeve said in tones of deepest satisfaction.</p>
