<h4><em>To Understand a Message</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">G</span>raendal
managed not to stare as she entered the
room, but her streith gown went dead black before she could control
herself and return it to a blue mist. Sammael had done enough to
make anyone doubt that this chamber was in the Great Hall of the
Council in Illian. But then, she would be very surprised if anyone
but he ever penetrated this far uninvited into &ldquo;Lord Brend&rsquo;s&rdquo;
apartments.</p>

<p>The air was pleasantly cool; in one corner rose the
hollow cylinder of an exchanger. Glowbulbs, bright and steady,
stood oddly in heavy gold candleholders, giving much better
illumination than candles or oil lamps ever could. A small music
box sat on the marble mantelpiece, producing from its memory the
soft strains of a sound-sculpture that very likely had not been
heard outside this room in well over three thousand years. And she
recognized several of the artworks on the walls.</p>

<p>She paused in front of Ceran Tol&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tempo of
Infinity.&rdquo; Not a copy. &ldquo;One might think you had looted a museum,
Sammael.&rdquo; It was hard to keep the envy from her voice, and when she
saw his faint smile, she realized she had failed.</p>

<p>Filling two silver-chased goblets with wine, he
handed her one. &ldquo;Only a stasis box. I suppose people tried to save
what they could in the last days.&rdquo; His smile pulled at that awful
scar across his face as he beamed around the chamber, with especial
fondness for the zara board projecting its field of
still-transparent boxes in the air; he had always liked the more
violent games. Of course, a zara board meant his stasis box had
been filled by someone who followed the Great Lord; possession of a
single once-human playing piece had meant imprisonment at the least
on the other side. What else had he found?</p>

<p>Sipping her wine&mdash;and suppressing a sigh; it
was from the here and now; she had hoped for a delicate Satare or
one of the exquisite Comolads&mdash;she stroked her gown with
beringed fingers. &ldquo;I found one as well, but beyond streith, it
contained the most appalling collection of useless rubbish.&rdquo; After
all, since he had invited her here and let her see this, it was a
time for confidences. Small confidences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How sad for you.&rdquo; Again that faint smile. He <em>
had</em> found something more than playthings and pretties. &ldquo;On the
other hand,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;think how awful it would have been to
open a box and rouse a nest of cafar, say, or a jumara, or one of
Aginor&rsquo;s other little creations. Did you know there are jumara
loose in the Blight? Full-grown, though they&rsquo;ll never
transform now. They call them Worms.&rdquo; He laughed so hard at that,
he shook.</p>

<p>Graendal smiled a good deal more warmly than she felt
inside, though if her gown changed color, it was by a hair. She had
had an unpleasant, in fact almost fatal, experience with one of
Aginor&rsquo;s creations. The man had been brilliant in his way, but
mad. None but a madman would have made the <em>gholam</em>. &ldquo;You seem in
very good mood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I not be?&rdquo; he said expansively. &ldquo;I all
but have my hands on a cache of <em>angreal</em> and who can say
what else. Do not look so surprised. Of course I&rsquo;ve known that
the rest of you have been trying to look over my shoulder in hopes
I will lead you to it. Well, it will do you no good. Oh, I will
share, but after it&rsquo;s mine, and after I have first choice.&rdquo;
Sprawling in a heavily gilded chair&mdash;or perhaps it was solid
gold; that would be like him&mdash;he balanced one boot atop the
toe of the other and stroked his golden beard. &ldquo;Besides, I sent an
emissary to al&rsquo;Thor. And the answer was favorable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graendal almost spilled her wine. &ldquo;It was? I heard
that he killed your messenger.&rdquo; If her knowing that much shook him,
he held it in. He even smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Al&rsquo;Thor killed no one. Andris went there to
die; do you think I wanted to wait on couriers, or <em>
pigeons</em>? How he died told me al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which was?&rdquo; she said carefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A truce between us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Icy fingers seemed to dig into her scalp. It could
not be true. Yet he looked more at ease than she had seen him since
waking. &ldquo;Lews Therin would never&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lews Therin is long dead, Graendal.&rdquo; The
interruption was amused, even mocking. No anger at all.</p>

<p>She covered a deep breath by pretending to drink.
Could it be true? &ldquo;His army is still gathering in Tear. I have seen
it. That hardly looks like a truce to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sammael laughed outright. &ldquo;It takes time to redirect
an army. Believe me, it will never move against me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think not? One or two of my little friends say
he wants you dead because you killed some of his pet Maidens. Were
I you, I would be thinking about somewhere less conspicuous,
somewhere he might not find me.&rdquo; Not a flicker of an eyelid out of
him. It was as if all the strings that usually moved him had been
cut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What should it matter a few Maidens died?&rdquo; The look
on his face was truly puzzled. &ldquo;It was battle; soldiers die in
battle. Al&rsquo;Thor may be a farmer, but he has generals to fight
his battles and explain matters. I doubt he even noticed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You really never have looked at these people. They
have changed as much as the land, Sammael. Not just the Aiel. In
some ways, the rest have changed much more. Those soldiers were
women, and to Rand al&rsquo;Thor, that makes a difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shrugged dismissively, and she suppressed
contempt, kept the streith steady in a calm fog. He had never
understood that you must understand people to make them do as you
wished. Compulsion was all very well, but you could not use
Compulsion on the entire world.</p>

<p>She wondered whether the stasis box had been this
cache that he claimed he would put his hands on soon. If he had
even one <em>angreal</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;if he did, she would find out, but
probably not before he let her. &ldquo;I suppose we shall see how much
wiser the primitive Lews Therin has become, then.&rdquo; She raised a
doubting eyebrow, managed a smile of her own. No reaction. Where
had he found this leash for his temper? Lews Therin&rsquo;s name
alone should have been enough to loose it. &ldquo;If he fails to chase
you out of Illian like a cosa scampering up a tree, perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That might be waiting too long,&rdquo; he cut in smoothly.
 &ldquo;Too long for you, that is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that supposed to be a threat, Sammael?&rdquo; Her gown
shifted to a pale rose, but she let it stay. Let him be aware she
was angry. &ldquo;I thought you learned long ago that threatening me is a
mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No threats, Graendal,&rdquo; he replied calmly. All of his
pressure points had gone numb; nothing seemed to shift him out of
that amused coolness. &ldquo;Merely facts. Al&rsquo;Thor will not attack
me, and I will not attack him. And of course, I agreed not to aid
any other Chosen should al&rsquo;Thor find them. All very much in
accordance with the Great Lord&rsquo;s commands, wouldn&rsquo;t you
say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; She kept her face smooth, but the
streith had gone a deeper rose, losing some of its mistiness. In
part the color was still anger. There was more to this, but how was
she to find out?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which means,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that on the Day of
Return, I will very likely be the only one remaining to face
al&rsquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt he will manage to kill all of us,&rdquo; she said
acidly, but acid churned in her stomach, as well. Too many of the
Chosen had died. Sammael <em>had</em> found a way to stand aside
until the last; it was the only explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think not? Not even if he learns where you all
are?&rdquo; That smile deepened. &ldquo;I am sure I know what Demandred is
scheming, but where is he hiding? Where is Semirhage? Mesaana? What
about Asmodean and Lanfear? Moghedien?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those cold fingers returned, imprinting themselves on
her skull. He would not lounge there and talk this way&mdash;he
would not dare suggest what he was suggesting&mdash;unless&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&ldquo;Asmodean and Lanfear are dead, and I am sure Moghedien must be,
too.&rdquo; She was surprised to hear her own voice, hoarse and unsteady.
Wine did not seem to dampen her dry throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the others?&rdquo; It was just a question; his voice
was not in the slightest insistent. It sent a shiver through
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you what I know, Sammael.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which is nothing. When I am Nae&rsquo;blis, I will
choose who stand just below me. That one will have to be alive to
receive the Great Lord&rsquo;s touch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you saying you have been to Shayol Ghul? That
the Great Lord promised you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will know all when it is time, and not before.
But a small advice, Graendal. Prepare now. Where are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her mind worked furiously. He must have had that
promise. He must. But why him? No, there was no time for
speculation. The Great Lord chose as he wished. And Sammael knew
where she was, at least. She could flee Arad Doman, establish
herself elsewhere; it would not be difficult. Giving up the little
games she played there, and even the larger games that might have
to be abandoned, would be a small loss compared with having
al&rsquo;Thor&mdash;or Lews Therin&mdash;come after her. She had
no intention of ever confronting him directly; if Ishamael and
Rahvin had fallen to him, she was not about to risk his strength,
not head-on. Sammael <em>must</em> have had the promise. If he died
now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;he was certainly holding <em>saidin</em>&mdash;he would
be mad to say these things otherwise&mdash;and he would feel the
instant she embraced <em>saidar</em>. She would be the one to die.
He must have had it. &ldquo;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;do not know where Demandred or
Semirhage is. Mesaana&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Mesaana is in the White Tower. That is
all I know. I swear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A tightness in her chest loosened when he finally
nodded. &ldquo;You will find the others for me.&rdquo; It was not a question.
 &ldquo;All of them, Graendal. If you want me to believe anyone dead, show
me a corpse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She very much wished she dared turn him into a
corpse. Her gown rippled through violent shades of red, echoing the
anger and fear and shame that rippled through her uncontrollably.
Very well, let him think her cowed for the moment. If he fed
Mesaana to al&rsquo;Thor, if he fed them all to al&rsquo;Thor, so be
it, so long as that kept al&rsquo;Thor from her own throat. &ldquo;I will
try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do more than try, Graendal. More than try.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">When Graendal was gone, the gateway back to her
palace in Arad Doman closed, Sammael let the smile dissolve on his
face. His jaws ached from holding it. Graendal thought too much;
she was so used to making others act for her that she failed to
think of acting for herself. He wondered what she would say if she
ever discovered that he had manipulated her as deftly as she had
manipulated so many fools in her time. He would wager everything
that she never saw his real purpose. So, Mesaana was inside the
White Tower. Mesaana in the Tower, and Graendal in Arad Doman. Had
Graendal been able to see his face then, she would have known real
fear. Whatever happened, Sammael intended to be the one still
standing on the Day of Return, to be named Nae&rsquo;blis and defeat
the Dragon Reborn.</p>
