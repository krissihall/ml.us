<h4><em>A Saying in the Borderlands</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">F</span>or
a moment Rand wished for the days when he could
have strolled the Palace corridors alone. This morning he was
accompanied by Sulin and twenty Maidens, by Bael, clan chief of the
Goshien Aiel, with half a dozen <em>Sovin Nai</em>, Knife Hands, from the
Jhirad Goshien for Bael&rsquo;s honor, and by Bashere with as many
of his hawk-nosed Saldaeans. They crowded the broad, tapestry-hung
hallway, the <em>cadin&rsquo;sor</em>-clad <em>Far Dareis Mai</em>
and <em>Sovin Nai</em> staring through servants who bowed or
curtsied hastily and got out of the way, and the younger Saldaeans
swaggering in their short coats and their baggy breeches tucked
into their boots. It was hot even here in the shaded passage, and
dust motes danced in the air. Some of the servants wore the
red-and-white livery they had worn when Morgase ruled, but most
were new, garbed in whatever they had on when they came applying
for the job, a motley collection of farmers&rsquo; and
tradesmen&rsquo;s woolens, mainly dark and plain but running the
range of colors, with here and there splashes of embroidery or bits
of lace.</p>

<p>Rand made a mental note to have Mistress Harfor, the
First Maid, find livery enough to go around, so the newcomers would
not feel required to work in their best clothes. Palace livery was
certainly finer than anything country folk had except perhaps for
feastdays. The servants numbered fewer than in Morgase&rsquo;s day,
and a good many of the red-and-white attired men and women were
gray and stooped, out of the pensioners&rsquo; quarters. Instead of
fleeing when so many others did, they had quit their retirement
rather than see the palace become run down. Another mental note.
Have Mistress Harfor&mdash;First Maid was an unprepossessing
title, but Reene Harfor ran the Royal Palace day-to-day&mdash;find enough servants so these oldsters could enjoy their
pensions. Were the pensions still being paid with Morgase dead? He
should have thought of that before; Halwin Norry, the chief clerk,
would know. It was like being beaten to death with feathers.
Everything reminded him of something else to be done. The Ways;
that was no feather. He had the Waygate here in Caemlyn under
guard, and those near Tear and Cairhien, but he could not even be
sure how many more there were.</p>

<p>Yes, he would have traded all the bows and curtsies,
all the honor guards, all the questions and burdens, all the people
whose needs had to be met, for the days when he had to worry about
providing a coat for himself. Of course, in those days he would not
have been allowed to stroll these corridors at all, certainly not
without a different sort of guard, one to make sure he did not slip
a silver-and-gold chalice from its niche in the wall, or an ivory
carving from a lapis-inlaid table.</p>

<p>At least Lews Therin&rsquo;s voice was not muttering
at him this morning. At least he seemed to be getting the way of
the mental trick Taim had shown him; sweat trickled down
Bashere&rsquo;s face, but the heat hardly touched Rand. He wore his
silver-embroidered coat of gray silk buttoned to the neck, and if
he felt a little warm, he did not sweat a drop. Taim assured him
that in time he would not even feel heat or cold great enough to
disable another man. It was a matter of distancing from himself, of
concentrating inward, a little like the way he prepared to embrace
<em>saidin</em>. Strange that it should be so close to the Power
yet have nothing to do with it at all. Did Aes Sedai do the same?
He had never seen one sweat. Had he?</p>

<p>Abruptly he laughed out loud. Wondering whether Aes
Sedai ever sweated! Maybe he was not mad yet, but he could pass
fair for a wool-headed fool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I say something funny?&rdquo; Bashere asked dryly,
knuckling his mustaches. Some of the Maidens looked at him
expectantly; they were making an effort to understand wetlander
humor.</p>

<p>How Bashere kept his equanimity, Rand did not know. A
rumor had reached the Palace that very morning of fighting in the
Borderlands, between Borderlanders. Travelers&rsquo; tales sprang up
like weeds after rain, but this had come from the north, apparently
with merchants who had been at least as far as Tar Valon. Nothing
in it said where or who exactly. Saldaea was as likely as anywhere
else, and Bashere had had no word from there since he left months
ago, yet he might have heard that the price of turnips had risen
for all the effect the rumor had had on him.</p>

<p>Of course, Rand knew nothing of what was going on in
the Two Rivers either&mdash;unless vague mutters of an uprising
somewhere in the west touched his home; in these days, that could
be anything or nothing&mdash;but it was not the same for him. He
had abandoned the Two Rivers. Aes Sedai had spies everywhere, and
he would not wager a copper that the Forsaken did not as well. The
Dragon Reborn had no interest in the flyspeck village where Rand
al&rsquo;Thor had grown up; he was far beyond that. If he was not,
then Emond&rsquo;s Field was a hostage to use against him. Still, he
would not split hairs with himself. Abandonment was
abandonment.</p>

<p><em>If I could find a way to escape my destiny, do I
deserve to?</em> That was his own thought, not Lews
Therin&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Shifting shoulders that suddenly seemed to ache
dully, he kept his voice light. &ldquo;Forgive me, Bashere. Something odd
just occurred to me, but I have been listening. You were saying
Caemlyn is filling up. For every man who ran away because he was
afraid of the false Dragon, two have come because I&rsquo;m not, and
he isn&rsquo;t. You see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bashere grunted, which might have meant anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many have come for other reasons, Rand
al&rsquo;Thor?&rdquo; Bael was the tallest man Rand had ever seen, a good
hand taller than Rand himself. He made an odd contrast with
Bashere, who stood shorter than any of the Maidens except Enaila.
Gray streaked thickly through Bael&rsquo;s dark reddish hair, but
his face was lean and hard, his blue eyes sharp. &ldquo;You have enemies
enough for a hundred men. Mark me, they will try to strike at you
again. There could even be Shadowrunners among them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if there are no Darkfriends,&rdquo; Bashere put in,
 &ldquo;trouble brews in the city like tea left on the boil. A number of
people have been severely beaten, evidently for doubting
you&rsquo;re the Dragon Reborn, and one poor fellow was hauled from
a tavern into a barn and hanged from the rafters for laughing at
your miracles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My miracles?&rdquo; Rand said incredulously.</p>

<p>A wrinkled, white-haired serving man in a too-large
coat of livery, with a large vase in his hands, trying to bow and
step out of the way at the same time, tripped on his heel and fell
backward. The pale green vase, paper-thin Sea Folk porcelain, flew
over his head and went tumbling end-over-end across the dark red
floor tiles, spinning and bouncing until it came to rest, upright,
thirty or so paces down the hall. The old man scrambled to his feet
with surprising spryness and ran to snatch up the vase, running his
hands over it and exclaiming in disbelief as much as relief when he
found not a chip or a crack. Other servants stared with just as
much incredulity, before abruptly coming to themselves and hurrying
on about their tasks. They avoided looking at Rand so hard that
several forgot to bow or curtsy.</p>

<p>Bashere and Bael exchanged looks, and Bashere blew
out his thick mustaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange occurrences, then,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Every day
there&rsquo;s another story about a child falling headfirst onto
paving stones from a window forty feet up, without so much as a
single bruise. Or a grandmother getting in the way of two dozen
runaway horses, only somehow they don&rsquo;t even buffet her, much
less knock her down and trample her. Some fellow threw five crowns
twenty-two times straight at dice the other day, and they lay that
at your feet, too. Luckily for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is said,&rdquo; Bael added, &ldquo;that yesterday a basket of
roof tiles fell from a roof and landed in the street unbroken in
the shape of the ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai.&rdquo; He glanced at
the open-mouthed white-haired servant, clutching the vase to his
chest as they passed. &ldquo;I do not doubt that it did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand exhaled slowly. They did not mention the other
sort, of course. The man who stumbled on a step and was hanged when
his kerchief caught on the door latch. The loose slate ripped from
a roof by a high wind that sailed through an open window and a
doorway to kill a woman sitting at table with her family. The sort
of thing that did happen, but rarely. Only such things were not
rare around him. For good or ill, for ill as often as good, he
twisted chance merely by being within a few miles. No, if the
Dragons disappeared from his arms and the branded herons from his
palms, he was still marked. There was a saying in the Borderlands:
&ldquo;<em>Duty is heavier than a mountain, death lighter than a
feather.</em>&rdquo; Once you had that mountain firmly on your shoulders,
there was no way to put it down. There was no one else to carry it
anyway, and no use whining about it.</p>

<p>He made his voice brisk. &ldquo;Have you found the men who
did the hanging?&rdquo; Bashere shook his head. &ldquo;Then find them, and
arrest them for murder. I want a stop put to this. Doubting me
isn&rsquo;t a crime.&rdquo; Rumor said the Prophet had made it one, but
there was nothing he could do about that yet. He did not even know
where Masema was, beyond somewhere in Ghealdan or Amadicia. If he
had not gone elsewhere meantime. Yet another note chalked up in his
head; he had to find the man and rein him somehow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter how far it goes?&rdquo; Bashere said. &ldquo;There are
whispers you&rsquo;re a false Dragon who killed Morgase with Aes
Sedai help. The people are supposed to rise up against you and
avenge their queen. There may be more than one someone. It
isn&rsquo;t clear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s face hardened. The first part he could
live with&mdash;he had to; there were too many variations to stamp
out however many times he denied it&mdash;but he would not
tolerate incitement to rebellion. Andor would be one land he did
not split apart in war. He would give Elayne a land as unblemished
as it had come to him. If he ever found her, he would. &ldquo;Find who
began it,&rdquo; he said harshly, &ldquo;and toss them in prison.&rdquo; Light, how
to find who started a whisper? &ldquo;If they seek pardon, they can ask
Elayne for it.&rdquo; A young serving woman in a rough brown dress,
dusting a blue spun-glass bowl, caught sight of his face, and the
bowl dropped from her suddenly shaking hands and shattered. He did
not always alter chance. &ldquo;Is there any good news? I could do with
some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young woman bent unsteadily to gather up the
shards of the bowl, but Sulin glanced at her, just glanced, and she
sprang back, flattening herself wide-eyed against a tapestry
showing a leopard hunt. Rand did not understand it, but some women
seemed more frightened of the Maidens than they did of Aielmen. The
young woman looked at Bael as if hoping he would protect her. He
did not appear to see her at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That depends on how you define good news.&rdquo; Bashere
shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned that Ellorien of House Traemane and
Pelivar of House Coelan entered the city three days ago. Sneaked
in, you might say, and neither has come near the Inner City that
I&rsquo;ve heard. Talk in the streets has Dyelin of House Taravin in
the country nearby. None of them has responded to your invitations.
I&rsquo;ve heard nothing to connect any of them to the whispers.&rdquo; He
glanced at Bael, who gave a slight shake of his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We hear less than you, Davram Bashere. These people
speak more freely around other wetlanders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was good news in any case. Those were people Rand
needed. If they believed him a false Dragon, he could find a way
around that. If they believed he had killed Morgase&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, so
much the better if they remained loyal to her memory, and her
blood. &ldquo;Send them fresh invitations to visit me. Include
Dyelin&rsquo;s name; they may know where she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I send such an invitation,&rdquo; Bashere said
doubtfully, &ldquo;it may do no more than remind them there&rsquo;s a
Saldaean army in Andor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand hesitated, then nodded, suddenly grinning. &ldquo;Ask
the Lady Arymilla to carry it. I don&rsquo;t doubt she&rsquo;ll leap
at the chance to show them how close she is to me. But you write
it out.&rdquo; Moiraine&rsquo;s lessons in playing the Game of Houses were
coming in useful once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know whether it is good news or bad,&rdquo; Bael
said, &ldquo;but the Red Shields tell me two Aes Sedai have taken rooms
at an inn in the New City.&rdquo; The Red Shields had been helping
Bashere&rsquo;s men police Caemlyn and were now taking it over
alone. Bael grinned slightly at the chagrin on Bashere&rsquo;s face.
 &ldquo;We hear less, Davram Bashere, but perhaps sometimes we see
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is one of them our friend who likes cats?&rdquo; Rand
asked. The stories of an Aes Sedai in the city persisted; sometimes
there were two, or three, or a whole party. The closest Bashere or
Bael had come to anything at all, though, were a few stories of an
Aes Sedai who Healed dogs and cats, but always the next street
over, told by someone who had been told by someone who had heard it
in a tavern or in the market.</p>

<p>Bael shook his head. &ldquo;I do not think so. The Red
Shields said these two seem to have arrived in the night.&rdquo; Bashere
looked interested&mdash;he seldom let an opportunity pass to
repeat that Rand needed Aes Sedai&mdash;but Bael was frowning
slightly, so slightly it would not have been noticeable on anyone
but an Aiel. Aiel were careful in their dealings with Aes Sedai,
even reluctant.</p>

<p>Those few words contained plenty for Rand to think
on, and every path came back to himself. Two Aes Sedai had to have
a reason to come into Caemlyn, when their sisters were avoiding the
city since he appeared there. The most likely reason was something
to do with him. In the best of times few people journeyed by night,
and these were not the best times. Aes Sedai arriving in the dark
might be trying to avoid notice, and the most likely notice for
them to avoid was his. On the other hand, they might just be going
somewhere urgently. Which could spell a mission for the Tower. The
truth of it was, he could not think what might be more important to
the Tower right now than himself. Or they might be on their way to
join the Aes Sedai that Egwene insisted were going to support
him.</p>

<p>Whatever it was, he wanted to know. The Light alone
knew what the Aes Sedai were up to&mdash;the Tower or
Elayne&rsquo;s hidden lot&mdash;but he had to find out. There were
too many of them, and they could be too dangerous, for him not to.
How would the Tower react when Elaida learned of his amnesty? How
would any Aes Sedai? Had they heard yet?</p>

<p>As they approached the doors at the end of the
corridor, he opened his mouth to tell Bael to ask one of the Aes
Sedai to come to the Palace. He could handle two Aes Sedai if it
came to that&mdash;so long as they did not catch him by surprise&mdash;but there was no point taking chances until he knew who they
were and what they were about.</p>

<p><em>Pride fills me. I am sick with the pride that
destroyed me!</em></p>

<p>Rand missed a step. That was the first time today
that Lews Therin&rsquo;s voice had spoken inside his head&mdash;and
too much like a comment on his thoughts of Aes Sedai for comfort&mdash;but it was not what made him swallow what he had been going
to say and stop dead.</p>

<p>Because of the heat the doors stood open, giving out
into one of the Palace gardens. The flowers were gone, and some of
the rose and whitestar bushes looked wilted, but the shade trees
still stood, if with few leaves, around the white marble fountain
that splashed in the garden&rsquo;s heart. A woman in bulky brown
wool skirts and a loose white <em>algode</em> blouse stood beside
the fountain, a gray shawl looped over her arms, staring in wonder
as she often did at water with no use except to be looked at.
Rand&rsquo;s eyes drank in the lines of Aviendha&rsquo;s face, the
waves of reddish hair falling to her shoulders from the folded gray
scarf fastened around her temples. Light but she was beautiful.
Studying the spray of water, she had not seen him yet.</p>

<p>Did he love her? He did not know. She was all tangled
in his head and his dreams with Elayne, and even Min. What he did
know was that he was dangerous; he had nothing to offer any woman
except pain.</p>

<p><em>Ilyena,</em> Lews Therin wept. <em>I killed her!
The Light consume me forever!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;A pair of Aes Sedai showing up like that might be
important,&rdquo; Rand said quietly. &ldquo;I think I should visit this inn and
see why they&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; Almost everyone stopped when he did,
but Enaila and Jalani exchanged glances and kept on right past him
toward the garden. He raised his voice a fraction and hardened it
considerably more. &ldquo;The Maidens here will come with me. Anyone who
wants to put on a dress and discuss matchmaking can stay
behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Enaila and Jalani stiffened and spun to face him,
indignation lighting their eyes. A good thing Somara was not in
today&rsquo;s guard; she might have gone on anyway. Sulin&rsquo;s
fingers flashed in Maiden handtalk, and whatever she had to say, it
quenched indignation and set embarrassed flames in the two
Maidens&rsquo; cheeks instead. The Aiel had all sorts of hand
signals for when silence was best. Every clan had its private set,
and every society as well, besides which there were those all the
Aiel knew, but only the Maidens had made a language of them.</p>

<p>Rand did not wait for Sulin to finish before turning
away from the garden. These Aes Sedai might leave Caemlyn as
quickly as they had come. He glanced over his shoulder. Aviendha
was still staring at the water; she had not seen him. He quickened
his step. &ldquo;Bashere, would you send one of your men to have horses
readied? At the South Stable Gate.&rdquo; The main gates of the Palace
opened onto the Queen&rsquo;s Plaza, which would be full of people
hoping for a glimpse of him. It would have taken half an hour to
make a way through, if he was lucky.</p>

<p>Bashere motioned, and one of the younger Saldaeans
loped ahead in that rolling stride of a man more used to a saddle.
 &ldquo;A man must know when to retreat from a woman,&rdquo; Bashere said to the
air, &ldquo;but a wise man knows that sometimes he must stand and face
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young men,&rdquo; Bael said indulgently. &ldquo;A young man
chases shadows and runs from moonlight, and in the end he stabs
himself in the foot with his own spear.&rdquo; Some of the other Aiel
chuckled, Maidens and Knife Hands alike. The older ones did.</p>

<p>Irritated, Rand looked over his shoulder again.
 &ldquo;Neither of you would look well in a dress.&rdquo; Surprisingly, the
Maidens and Knife Hands laughed again, more loudly. Maybe he was
getting a grip on Aiel humor.</p>

<p>It was as he expected when he rode out of the South
Stable Gate into one of the Inner City&rsquo;s curving streets.
Jeade&rsquo;en&rsquo;s hooves rang on the paving stones as the
stallion frisked; the dapple seldom got out of the stable of late.
There were plenty of people in the street, but nowhere near the
numbers to be expected on the other side of the palace and all
going about their own business. Even so, fingers pointed, and
people leaned close to one another, murmuring. Some might have
recognized Bashere&mdash;unlike Rand, he had been out and about in
the city often&mdash;but anybody emerging from the Palace,
especially with an escort of trotting Aiel, had to be important.
The murmurs and pointing fingers followed.</p>

<p>Despite the stares, Rand tried to enjoy the beauties
of the Ogier-built Inner City. The few occasions he found to just
enjoy anything were precious. Streets curved out from the shining
white Royal Palace, flowing along the contours of the hills like a
part of the land. Everywhere stood slender towers covered in
colored tiles, or domes of gold or purple or white, sparkling in
the sunlight. Here a line of sight had been left clear to give a
view of tree-filled park, there a rise threw the eyes across the
city to the rolling plains and forests beyond the tall
silver-streaked white wall that enclosed all of Caemlyn. The Inner
City had been laid out to delight and soothe the eye. According to
the Ogier, only Tar Valon itself and storied Manetheren had ever
surpassed it, and many humans, Andorans foremost among them,
believed that Caemlyn matched either.</p>

<p>The pure white walls of the Inner City marked the
beginning of the surrounding New City, with its own domes and
spires, some trying to match the height of those in the Inner City
on its higher hills. Here the narrower streets were packed full of
humanity, and even the broad boulevards, split down the middle by
tree-lined expanses, were filled with people and ox-carts and
horse-drawn wagons, folk on horseback and in carriages and sedan
chairs. A buzz hung in the air, as from a huge hive of bees.</p>

<p>Passage was slower here, though the crowds gave way.
They did not know who he was any more than did those in the Inner
City, but no one wanted to get in the way of striding Aiel. It
simply took time with so many people. And there was every sort of
person. Farmers in rough woolens and merchants in coats or dresses
of finer cut. Craftsmen hurrying about their trades and hawkers
crying their wares from trays and pushcarts, everything from pins
and ribbons to fruit and fireworks, the last two equally dear now.
A gleeman in his patch-covered cloak rubbed shoulders with three
Aiel inspecting the blades displayed on tables before a
cutler&rsquo;s workshop. Two lean fellows with their dark hair in
braids and swords on their backs&mdash;Hunters for the Horn, Rand
expected&mdash;stood chatting with a number of Saldaeans as they
listened to a woman playing the flute and a man the tambour on a
street corner. Cairhienin, shorter and paler, stood out among the
Andorans, and so did the darker Tairens, but Rand saw Murandians in
long coats and Altarans in elaborate vests, fork-bearded Kandori,
even a pair of Domani with long thin mustaches and earrings.</p>

<p>Another sort of people stood out too, those who
wandered about in rumpled coats and wrinkled dresses, often dusty
and always blinking and staring, plainly with nowhere to go and no
idea of what to do next. That sort had gone as far as they could
toward what they sought. Him. The Dragon Reborn. What he was to do
with them he had no notion, yet they were his responsibility, one
way or another. No matter that he had not asked them to throw over
their lives, had not wanted them to abandon everything. They had.
Because of him. And if they learned who he was, they might well
overwhelm the Aiel and tear him apart in their eagerness just to
touch him.</p>

<p>He touched the fat-little-man <em>angreal</em> in his
coat pocket. A fine thing, if it came to him using the One Power to
protect himself against people who had given up everything because
of him. That was why he seldom ventured into the city. One reason,
anyway. There was just too much to be done to go for an idle
ride.</p>

<p>The inn Bael led him to, toward the western end of
the city, was called Culain&rsquo;s Hound, three stories of stone
with a red tile roof. On the twisting side street, the passing
throng backed up both ways, narrowing to crowd around Rand&rsquo;s
party when it stopped. Rand touched the <em>angreal</em> again&mdash;two Aes Sedai; he should be able to handle them without
resorting to that&mdash;before dismounting and going in. Not
before three Maidens and a pair of Knife Hands, of course, all on
their toes and a hair from veiling. He could have taught a cat to
sing first. Leaving two Saldaeans with the horses, Bashere and the
others strode in at his heels along with Bael, the rest of the Aiel
following except for those who had taken up guard outside. What
they found was not what Rand expected.</p>

<p>The common room could have changed places with any of
a hundred or more in Caemlyn, great barrels of ale and wine lining
one plain plastered wall, topped with smaller casks of brandy, and
a gray-striped cat sprawled on top of all, a pair of stone
fireplaces, the hearths swept bare, and three or four aproned
serving women moving among tables and benches scattered around a
bare wooden floor beneath a beamed ceiling. The innkeeper, a
round-faced man with three chins, a white apron straining around
his bulk, trotted up washing his hands and eyeing the Aiel only a
touch nervously. Caemlyn had learned they were not going to pillage
and burn everything in sight&mdash;convincing the Aiel that Andor
was not a conquered land and they could not take the fifth had been
a harder proposition&mdash;but that was not to say innkeepers were
used to having two dozen appear in their common rooms at once.</p>

<p>The innkeeper concentrated on Rand and Bashere.
Mainly on Bashere. Both were clearly men of substance by their
clothes, but Bashere was the elder by a good many years and thus
likely to be the more important, &ldquo;Welcome, my Lord, my Lords. What
may I offer you? I have wines from Murandy as well as Andoran,
brandy from&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand ignored the man. What was not like a hundred
other common rooms was the patrons. At this hour he would have
expected one or two men perhaps, but there were none. Instead most
of the tables were filled with plainly dressed young women, girls
really for the most part, who twisted around on their benches,
teacups in hand, to gawk at the new arrivals. More than one gasped
at Bael&rsquo;s height. Not all of them stared at the Aiel, though,
and it was the near dozen who gaped at him that made Rand&rsquo;s
eyes widen. He knew them. Not all well, but he did know them. One
in particular seized his attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bode?&rdquo; he said in disbelief. That big-eyed girl
staring at him&mdash;when had she gotten old enough to put her
hair in a braid?&mdash;was Bodewhin Cauthon, Mat&rsquo;s sister.
And there was plump Hilde Barran sitting next to skinny Jerilin
al&rsquo;Caar, and pretty Marisa Ahan, with her hands clapped to her
cheeks the way she always did when surprised, and buxom Emry Lewin
and Elise Marwin and Darea Candwin and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;they were from
Emond&rsquo;s Field, or close by. Darting a look over the rest of
the tables, he realized the others must be Two Rivers girls, too.
Most of them, anyway&mdash;he saw a Domani face, and one or two
more that might well be from off&mdash;but every dress could have
been seen any day on the Green in Emond&rsquo;s Field. &ldquo;What under
the Light are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are on our way to Tar Valon,&rdquo; Bode managed
despite gaping. The only thing about her that looked at all like
Mat was a mischievous something around the eyes. Her astonishment
at seeing him vanished quickly in a broad smile of wonder and
delight. &ldquo;To become Aes Sedai, like Egwene and Nynaeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could ask the same of you,&rdquo; willowy Larine
Ayellin put in, arranging her thick braid over her shoulder with
studied casualness. The oldest of the Emond&rsquo;s Field girls&mdash;a good three years younger than him, but the only one
besides Bode to have her hair braided&mdash;she had always had a
good opinion of herself. She was pretty enough for all the boys to
have confirmed it for her. &ldquo;Lord Perrin hardly said two words about
you except to say you were off having adventures. And wearing fine
coats, which I see you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mat well?&rdquo; Bode asked, suddenly anxious. &ldquo;Is he
with you? Mother worries about him so. He wouldn&rsquo;t even
remember to put on clean stockings if someone didn&rsquo;t tell
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Rand said slowly, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s not here. But
he&rsquo;s well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We hardly expected to find you in Caemlyn,&rdquo; Jancy
Torfinn piped up in her high voice. She could not be more than
fourteen; she was the youngest, at least among the Emond&rsquo;s
Fielders. &ldquo;Verin Sedai and Alanna Sedai will be pleased, I&rsquo;ll
wager. They&rsquo;re always asking what we know about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So those were the two Aes Sedai. He knew Verin, a
Brown sister, more than slightly. He did not know what to think
about her being here, though. That was hardly most important
anyway. These girls were from <em>home</em>. &ldquo;Everything is all
right in the Two Rivers, then? In Emond&rsquo;s Field? Perrin got
there all right, it seems. Wait! <em>Lord</em> Perrin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That opened the sluice gate. The rest of the Two
Rivers girls were more interested in studying the Aiel with
sidelong peeks, especially Bael, and a few spared glances for the
Saldaeans, but the Emond&rsquo;s Field girls crowded around Rand,
all trying to tell him everything at once, all jumbled up and wrong
way round, interspersed with questions about himself and Mat, about
Egwene and Nynaeve, most of which he could not have answered in
under an hour had they given him a chance.</p>

<p>Trollocs had invaded the Two Rivers, but Lord Perrin
drove them off. They went on so about the great battle, everyone
talking at the same time, that it was hard to pick out any details
except that there had been one. Everybody fought, of course, but it
had been Lord Perrin who saved everybody. Always Lord Perrin; any
time he said just Perrin they corrected him in the perfunctory way
they might someone who said horse when he should have said
sawhorse.</p>

<p>Even with the news that the Trollocs were beaten,
Rand&rsquo;s chest tightened. He had abandoned them to this. If he
had gone, there might not have been such a long list of the dead,
so many names that he knew. But if he had gone, he would not have
the Aiel behind him. Cairhien would not be his, as much as it was,
and Rahvin would likely be sending a united Andor against him and
the Two Rivers. There was a price to be paid for any decision he
made. There was a price for who he was. Other people paid it. He
had to keep reminding himself that it was a far smaller price than
they would pay without him. The reminder did not help much,
though.</p>

<p>Taking his expression for dismay at the listing of
Two Rivers&rsquo; dead, the girls hastened on to happier things. It
seemed Perrin had married Faile, too. Rand wished him happiness in
that, and wondered how long any happiness they found could last.
The girls thought it romantic and wonderful, and only seemed to
regret that there had been no time for the usual wedding parties.
They were quite approving of Faile, quite admiring, and a touch
envious, even Larine.</p>

<p>There had been Whitecloaks, too, and with them Padan
Fain, the old peddler who used to come to Emond&rsquo;s Field every
spring. The girls seemed unsure whether the Whitecloaks had been
friends or enemies, but to Rand, Fain made the difference if there
was any real doubt. Fain was a Darkfriend, maybe worse than a
Darkfriend, who would do anything to harm Rand and Mat and Perrin.
Especially Rand. Maybe the worst news they had to tell him was that
no one knew whether Fain was dead. In any case, the Whitecloaks
were gone, the Trollocs were gone, and refugees were flooding in
across the Mountains of Mist, bringing all sorts of new things,
from customs to trades, plants and seeds to clothes. One of the
other girls was a Domani, and there were two Taraboners and three
from Almoth Plain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Larine bought a Domani dress,&rdquo; little Jancy laughed,
cutting her eyes, &ldquo;but her mother made her take it back to the
seamstress.&rdquo; Larine raised her hand, then thought better of it and
simply rearranged her braid with a sniff. Jancy giggled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who cares about dresses?&rdquo; Susa al&rsquo;Seen
exclaimed. &ldquo;Rand doesn&rsquo;t care about dresses.&rdquo; A slight,
fluttery girl, Susa had always been excitable, and right now she
was bouncing on her toes. &ldquo;Alanna Sedai and Verin Sedai tested
everybody. Well. Almost everybody&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cilia Cole wanted to be tested, too,&rdquo; Marce Eldin, a
stocky girl, put in. Rand did not much remember her, except that
she had always had her nose in a book, even walking in the street.
 &ldquo;She insisted! She passed, but they told her she was too old to be
a novice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Susa went right on over Marce. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and we all
passed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been traveling all day and practically
all night since Whitebridge,&rdquo; Bode put in. &ldquo;It is so good to stay
in one place a little while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Whitebridge, Rand?&rdquo; Jancy said on top
of Bode. &ldquo;The White Bridge itself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and we&rsquo;re going to Tar Valon to become
Aes Sedai!&rdquo; Susa finished with a glare that took in Bode, Marce and
Jancy. &ldquo;In Tar Valon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will not be going to Tar Valon just yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voice from the door to the street spun the
girls&rsquo; attention from Rand, but the two Aes Sedai just coming
in waved aside their questions offhandedly. The Aes Sedai&rsquo;s
regard was all for Rand. They were disparate women, despite the
common link of their faces. Either could have been any age at all,
but Verin was short and plump, square-faced, with a touch of gray
in her hair, while the other, who must be Alanna, was dark and
slender, a beautiful vulpine woman with waves of black hair and a
light in her eyes that spoke of a temper. And with a slight redness
around them, as if she had been crying, though Rand could hardly
believe an Aes Sedai weeping. Her riding dress was gray silk
slashed with green, and looked as if she had just donned it, while
Verin&rsquo;s pale brown appeared slightly rumpled. If Verin paid
little heed to her clothes, though, her dark eyes were sharp
enough. They latched on to Rand as tightly as mussels on a
rock.</p>

<p>Two men in dull green coats followed them into the
common room, one stocky and gray-haired, the other a tall dark whip
of a man, but each had a sword on his hip, and the fluid way they
moved would have named them Warders even without the Aes Sedai.
They ignored Rand entirely, instead watching the Aiel and Saldaeans
with a stillness that spoke of sudden movement in check. For their
part, the Aiel did not move exactly, but there was an air of veils
going up about them, Maidens and Knife Hands alike, and the young
Saldaeans&rsquo; fingers suddenly hovered near sword hilts. Only
Bael and Bashere appeared truly at ease. The girls noticed nothing
except the Aes Sedai, but the fat innkeeper sensed the mood and
began wringing his hands, no doubt seeing his common room
destroyed, if not his whole inn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There will be no trouble,&rdquo; Rand said loudly and
levelly, for the innkeeper, for the Aiel. For everyone, he hoped.
 &ldquo;No trouble unless you start it, Verin.&rdquo; Several of the girls
goggled at him, speaking so to an Aes Sedai, and Larine sniffed
loudly.</p>

<p>Verin studied him with birdlike eyes. &ldquo;Who are we to
start trouble near you? You have come far since I saw you
last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For some reason, he did not want to talk about that.
 &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve decided not to go to Tar Valon, then you must have
heard the Tower is broken.&rdquo; That caused a startled buzz among the
girls; they certainly had not heard. The Aes Sedai gave no reaction
at all. &ldquo;Do you know where those who oppose Elaida are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are things we should discuss in private,&rdquo;
Alanna said calmly. &ldquo;Master Dilham, we will need your private
dining room.&rdquo; The innkeeper nearly fell over himself assuring her
that it was at her disposal.</p>

<p>Verin started toward a side door. &ldquo;This way, Rand.&rdquo;
Alanna looked at him, raising a questioning eyebrow.</p>

<p>Rand held in a wry grin. They had just walked in and
taken charge, but it seemed that Aes Sedai did that as naturally as
breathing. The Two Rivers girls stared at him with varying degrees
of commiseration. Doubtless they expected the Aes Sedai to skin him
if he did not speak right and sit straight. Perhaps Verin and
Alanna did, too. With a smooth bow he motioned for Alanna to
proceed him. So he had come a long way, had he? They had no idea
how far.</p>

<p>Alanna acknowledged his bow with a nod, gathered her
skirts and glided after Verin, but trouble followed immediately.
The two Warders made as if to trail the Aes Sedai, and before they
had taken a full step a pair of cold-eyed <em>Sovin Nai</em> moved to block
them, while Sulin&rsquo;s fingers flickered in handtalk, sending
Enaila and a blocky Maiden named Dagendra toward the door the Aes
Sedai were approaching. The Saldaeans looked to Bashere, who
gestured for them to stay, but then he himself looked a question at
Rand.</p>

<p>Alanna made a vexed sound. &ldquo;We will speak with him
alone, Ihvon.&rdquo; The slender Warder frowned, then nodded slowly.</p>

<p>Verin glanced back, looking slightly startled, as
though pulled from deep thought. &ldquo;What? Oh, yes, of course. Tomas,
stay here, please.&rdquo; The gray-haired Warder appeared doubtful, and
he gave Rand a hard look before lounging back against the wall
beside the door to the street. At least, he was lounging if a
tripwire could be said to be lounging. Only then did the Knife
Hands relax&mdash;as much as Aiel ever relaxed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to talk to them alone,&rdquo; Rand said, looking
straight at Sulin. For a moment he thought she meant to dispute
him. Her jaw firmed stubbornly; finally handtalk passed between
her, Enaila and Dagendra, and they moved back, looking at him and
shaking their heads in disapproval. Sulin&rsquo;s fingers moved
again, and all the Maidens laughed. He wished there was some way to
learn handtalk; Sulin had been scandalized when he asked.</p>

<p>Confused looks passed among the Two Rivers girls as
Rand started after the Aes Sedai, and he closed the door behind
them on a rising buzz. It was a small room, but with polished
chairs instead of benches and pewter candlesticks on both the
polished table and the vine-carved mantel above the fireplace. The
two windows were shut, yet no one made a move to open one. He
wondered if either Aes Sedai had noticed that the heat touched him
no more than it did them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you be taking them to the rebels?&rdquo; he asked
immediately.</p>

<p>Frowning, Verin smoothed her skirts. &ldquo;You know
considerably more about that than we do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did not hear of events in the Tower until
Whitebridge.&rdquo; Alanna&rsquo;s tone was cool, but there was heat in
the eyes she kept fixed on him. &ldquo;What do you know of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;rebels?&rdquo;
A world of distaste entered her voice with that word.</p>

<p>So they had heard the rumors first in Whitebridge,
and made haste here, keeping everything from the girls. And by the
reactions of Bode and the others, the decision not to go to Tar
Valon was fresh. Seemingly they had found confirmation this
morning. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;ll tell me who your spy in
Caemlyn is.&rdquo; They merely looked at him, Verin tilting her head to
study him. Strange how Aes Sedai gazes had been so unsettling once,
so serene whatever was happening, so knowing. Having an Aes Sedai
stare at him, or even two, no longer made his stomach turn
uneasily. <em>Pride</em>, Lews Therin laughed madly; and Rand
suppressed a grimace. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been told rebels exist. You
haven&rsquo;t denied knowing where they are. I mean no harm to them,
far from it. I have reason to believe they might support me.&rdquo; He
kept back his main reason for wanting to know. Perhaps Bashere was
right, perhaps he did need Aes Sedai backing, but mainly he wanted
to know because he had been told Elayne was with them. He needed
her to gain Andor peacefully. That was his only motive in seeking
her. The only one. He was as dangerous to her as to Aviendha. &ldquo;For
the love of the Light, if you know, tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we did know,&rdquo; Alanna replied, &ldquo;we would have no
right to tell anyone. Should they decide to support you, you may be
certain they will seek you out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In their time,&rdquo; Verin said, &ldquo;not yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled grimly. He should have expected as much, or
as little. Moiraine&rsquo;s advice was in the front of his head.
Trust no woman who wore the shawl on the day she died.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mat with you?&rdquo; Alanna asked as if that were the
last thing on her mind really.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I knew where he was, why should I tell you? Turn
and turn about?&rdquo; They did not seem to think that was funny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is foolish to treat us as enemies,&rdquo; Alanna
murmured, moving toward him. &ldquo;You look tired. Are you getting
enough rest?&rdquo; He stepped back from her raised hand, and she
stopped. &ldquo;Like you, Rand, I mean no harm. Nothing I do here will
cause you any injury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since she had said it straight out, it must be so. He
nodded, and she raised her hand to his head. His skin tingled
faintly as she embraced <em>saidar</em>, and a familiar warm ripple
passed through him, the feel of her checking his health.</p>

<p>Alanna nodded in satisfaction. And suddenly the
warmth was heat, one great flash of it, as if he stood for a
heartbeat in the middle of a roaring furnace. Even after it passed,
he felt odd, aware of himself as he never had been before, aware of
Alanna. He swayed, head light, muscles watery. An echo of confusion
and unease rang from Lews Therin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; he demanded. In a fury, he seized
<em>saidin</em>. The strength of it helped hold him upright. &ldquo;What
did you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something beat at the flow between him and the True
Source. They were trying to shield him! Weaving his own shields, he
slammed them into place. He truly had gone far, and learned much,
since Verin last saw him. Verin staggered, putting a hand on the
table for support, and Alanna grunted as if he had punched her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; Even deep in the cold emotionless
Void as he was, his voice grated. &ldquo;Tell me! I made no promises not
to hurt you. If you don&rsquo;t tell me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She bonded you,&rdquo; Verin said quickly, but if her
serenity had been ruffled, it cloaked her again in an instant. &ldquo;She
bonded you as one of her Warders. That is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alanna recovered her composure even faster. Shielded,
she faced him calmly, arms folded, a hint of contentment about her
eyes. Contentment! &ldquo;I said I would not injure you, and I have done
exactly the opposite of injury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drawing deep slow breaths, Rand tried to settle
himself. He had walked into it like a puppy. Rage crawled across
the outside of the Void. Calm. He must be calm. One of her Warders.
She was Green then; not that that made any difference. He knew
little of Warders, certainly not how to break the bond, or if it
could be broken. All Rand felt from Lews Therin was a sense of
stunned shock. Not for the first time Rand wished Lan had not gone
galloping away after Moiraine died.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said you won&rsquo;t be going to Tar Valon. In
that case, since you don&rsquo;t seem to know whether you know where
the rebels are, you can remain here in Caemlyn.&rdquo; Alanna opened her
mouth, but he rode over her. &ldquo;Be grateful if I decide not to tie
off those shields and leave you like that!&rdquo; That got their
attention. Verin&rsquo;s mouth tightened, and Alanna&rsquo;s eyes
could have done for that furnace he had felt. &ldquo;You will stay away
from me, though. Both of you. Unless I send for you, the Inner City
is barred to you. Try to break that, and I <em>will</em> leave you
shielded, and in a cell besides. Do we understand one another?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo; Despite her eyes, Alanna&rsquo;s voice
was ice. Verin merely nodded.</p>

<p>Flinging open the door, Rand stopped. He had
forgotten the Two Rivers girls. Some were talking to the Maidens,
some were just studying them and whispering over their tea. Bode
and a handful of the Emond&rsquo;s Fielders were questioning
Bashere, who had a pewter mug in his fist and one foot up on a
bench. They looked half-entertained, half-aghast. The door banging
open whipped their heads around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand,&rdquo; Bode exclaimed, &ldquo;this man is saying awful
things about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says you&rsquo;re the Dragon Reborn,&rdquo; Larine
spluttered. The girls in the rest of the room apparently had not
heard; they gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Rand said wearily.</p>

<p>Larine sniffed and folded her arms beneath her
breasts. &ldquo;As soon as I saw that coat I knew you had gotten a big
head, running off with an Aes Sedai the way you did. I knew it
before you talked so disrespectfully to Alanna Sedai and Verin
Sedai. But I didn&rsquo;t know you had become a stone blind
jack-fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bode&rsquo;s laugh was more appalled than amused. &ldquo;You
shouldn&rsquo;t say such a thing even as a joke, Rand. Tam raised
you better than that. You&rsquo;re Rand al&rsquo;Thor. Now stop this
foolishness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand al&rsquo;Thor. That was his name, but he hardly
knew who he was. Tam al&rsquo;Thor had raised him, but his father
had been an Aiel chief, now long dead. His mother had been a
Maiden, but not Aiel. That was as much as he really knew of who he
was.</p>

<p><em>Saidin</em> still filled him. Gently he wrapped
Bode and Larine in flows of Air and lifted them until their shoes
dangled a foot above the floor. &ldquo;I am the Dragon Reborn. Denying
won&rsquo;t change it. Wishing won&rsquo;t change it. I&rsquo;m not
the man you knew back in Emond&rsquo;s Field. Do you understand now?
Do you?&rdquo; He realized he was shouting and clamped his mouth shut.
His stomach was lead, and he was trembling. Why had Alanna done
what she did? What Aes Sedai scheme was hatching behind that pretty
face? Trust none of them, Moiraine had said.</p>

<p>A hand touched his arm, and his head jerked
around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please let them down,&rdquo; Alanna said. &ldquo;Please. They
are frightened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were more than frightened. Larine&rsquo;s face
seemed drained of blood, and her mouth gaped as wide as it would
go, as if she wanted to scream and had forgotten how. Bode was
sobbing so hard she quivered. They were not the only ones. The rest
of the Two Rivers girls had huddled together as far from him as
they could get, and most of them were crying too. The serving maids
were in that tight cluster as well, weeping as hard as anyone else.
The innkeeper had sagged to his knees, goggle-eyed and gurgling
wordlessly.</p>

<p>Rand eased the two girls back down and hastily let go
of <em>saidin</em>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean to scare
you.&rdquo; As soon as they could move, Bode and Larine fled to join the
other girls clutching one another. &ldquo;Bode? Larine? I&rsquo;m sorry. I
won&rsquo;t hurt you, I promise.&rdquo; They did not look at him. None of
them did. Sulin was certainly looking at him, and the rest of the
Maidens too, blank-faced, flat-eyed disapproving stares.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s done is done,&rdquo; Bashere said, setting
down his mug. &ldquo;Who knows? Perhaps it&rsquo;s for the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand nodded slowly. It probably was. Best that they
wanted to stay clear of him. Best for them. He just wished he could
have talked a little while longer about home. A little while longer
with them seeing only Rand al&rsquo;Thor. His knees still wobbled
from the bonding, but once he began moving, he did not stop until
he was back in Jeade&rsquo;en&rsquo;s saddle. Best that they were
afraid of him. Best that he forgot the Two Rivers. He wondered
whether that mountain ever got lighter for a time, or only kept on
getting heavier.</p>
