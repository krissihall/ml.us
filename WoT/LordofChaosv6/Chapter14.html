<h4><em>Dreams and Nightmares</em></h4>
<hr>

<p class="drop"><span class="dropcap">A</span>t
the sight of Nynaeve and Elayne, Egwene did not
step out of the dream; she leaped out. Not back to her sleeping
body in Cairhien&mdash;the night was too young yet&mdash;but to a
vast blackness filled with twinkling pinpricks of light, more by
far than the number of stars in the clearest sky, each sharp and
distinct as far as the eye could see. If she had had eyes here,
that was. Formless, she floated in the infinity between <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> and the waking world, the narrow gap
between dream and reality.</p>

<p>Had she possessed a heart here, it would have been
pounding like a mad drum. She did not think they had seen her, but
what under the Light were they doing <em>there</em>, in a part of
the Tower that held nothing of interest? On these nightly
excursions she carefully avoided the Amyrlin&rsquo;s study, the
novices&rsquo; quarters, even the Accepted&rsquo;s quarters. It
always seemed that if Nynaeve or Elayne or both were not in one of
those places, someone else was. She could have approached Nynaeve
or Elayne, of course&mdash;they certainly knew how to keep secrets&mdash;but something told her not to; she had dreamed of doing it,
and it always seemed a nightmare. Not the sort that woke you in a
cold sweat, but the kind that made you twist fretfully. Those other
women. Did the Aes Sedai in Salidar know strangers wandered the
Tower in the World of Dreams? Strange to her, at least. If they did
not, she had no way to warn them. No way she could take. It was all
so frustrating!</p>

<p>The great spangled ocean of darkness swirled around
her, seeming to move while she stood still. A fish at home in that
ocean, she swam confidently, without really needing to think about
it any more than the fish did. Those flickering lights were dreams,
all the dreams of all the people of the world. Of all worlds,
places that were not quite the world she knew, worlds nothing like
it at all. Verin Sedai first told her of those, the Wise Ones
affirmed it was so, and she herself had glimpsed things, peeking
in, that she simply could not credit, not even in a dream. Not
nightmares&mdash;those always seemed washed in red, or blue, or a
murky gray like deep shadows&mdash;but filled with impossible
things. Better to avoid them; clearly she did not belong in those
worlds. Peering into such a dream was like suddenly being
surrounded by broken mirrors, everything whirling and no way to
tell up from down. It made her want to empty her stomach, and if
she did not have one here, she would again on stepping back into
her body. Sicking up was no way to wake yourself.</p>

<p>She had learned a few things alone like this, added
to what the Wise Ones had taught her, even ventured where they
would have barred the way. And yet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she had no doubt she would
know more, much more, if she had had a dreamwalker looking over her
shoulder. Telling her that this was too dangerous yet and that
forbidden altogether, true, yet suggesting what to try as well.
Long past the simple things, easily puzzled out&mdash;well, not
exactly easily; never that&mdash;she had reached a point where she
could reason the next step on her own, but they were steps the Wise
One dreamwalkers had taken long ago. What took her a month to
master for herself, they could teach in a night, in an hour. When
they decided she was ready. Never until then. It galled so, when
all she wanted was to learn. To learn everything. Right now.</p>

<p>Each light looked identical to every other, yet she
had learned to recognize a handful. How exactly, she did not know,
a thing that irked her no end. Even the Wise Ones did not know
that. Still, once she identified which dream belonged to which
person, she could find that person&rsquo;s dreams again like an
arrow to the target, no matter if they went to the other side of
the world. That light was Berelain, the First of Mayene, the woman
Rand had put in charge in Cairhien. Looking into Berelain&rsquo;s
dreams made Egwene uncomfortable. Usually they were no different
from any other woman&rsquo;s&mdash;any woman interested equally in
power, politics and the latest fashion in dresses&mdash;but
sometimes Berelain dreamed of men, even men Egwene knew, in a way
that made Egwene blush to remember.</p>

<p>And that slightly muted glow over there was Rand, his
dreams guarded behind a ward woven of <em>saidin</em>. She almost
stopped&mdash;it piqued her that something she could not see or
feel could shut her out like a stone wall&mdash;but instead let it
pass. Another night of futility held no attraction.</p>

<p>This place skewed distance the way <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> did time. Rand was sleeping in
Caemlyn, unless he had jaunted to Tear, a thing she very much
wanted to know how he did, but only a little way from his dream,
Egwene picked out another light she recognized. Bair, in Cairhien,
hundreds of leagues from Rand; wherever Rand was, she knew for a
fact it was not Cairhien this night. <em>How</em> did he do it?</p>

<p>The field of lights streaked by as Egwene darted away
from the Wise One&rsquo;s dream. Had she seen Amys and Melaine as
well, she might not have fled, but if the other two dreamwalkers
were not asleep and dreaming, they could be dreamwalking. One of
them might be where she was, even ready to swoop down and haul her
out of the dream, or into the dreamwalker&rsquo;s own dream. She
doubted she could stop them, not yet. She would be at the
other&rsquo;s mercy, just a part of <em>her</em> dream. Holding on
to yourself inside someone else&rsquo;s dream was hard enough when
the dreamer was an ordinary person with no idea what was going on,
although no harder than getting out before they stopped dreaming of
you, which they were unlikely to do before waking with you actually
there in the dream. With a dreamwalker, as aware of her dreams as
of the walking world, it was impossible. And that would be the <em>
best</em> part of it.</p>

<p>It dawned on her that she was being foolish. Running
was useless. If Amys or Melaine had found her, she would be
somewhere else already. For that matter, she could be racing right
toward them. The rush of lights by her did not slow, it simply
stopped dead. That was the way here.</p>

<p>Vexed, she considered what to do next. Aside from teaching
herself what she could of <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>, her
main purpose here was to glean a few scraps of events in the world.
At times it seemed the Wise Ones would not tell her whether the sun
was up if she could not see for herself. They said she must not
become agitated. How could she avoid it, fretting over what she did
not know? That was what she had been doing in the White Tower;
trying to pick up some hint of Elaida&rsquo;s intentions. And
Alviarin&rsquo;s. Hints were the best she had been able to find, and
few of those. She hated not knowing; ignorance was like suddenly
going blind and deaf.</p>

<p>Well, the whole Tower was off her list now; it had to
be when she could no longer be certain which parts were safe. The
rest of Tar Valon had been struck off already, after the fourth
time she nearly walked into a copper-skinned woman, this time
nodding in satisfaction as, of all things, she studied a stable
that seemed freshly painted blue. Whoever she was, she had not
dreamed herself into <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> for a moment
by accident; she did not vanish, the way a casual dreamer did, and
she appeared made of mist. Using a <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em>,
obviously, which meant she was almost certainly Aes Sedai. Egwene
knew of only one <em>ter&rsquo;angreal</em> that allowed access to
the World of Dreams without channeling, and Nynaeve and Elayne had
that. The willowy woman had not been Aes Sedai long, though. Quite
beautiful&mdash;and wearing a scandalously thin dress&mdash;she
appeared Nynaeve&rsquo;s age, not ageless.</p>

<p>Egwene might have tried following her&mdash;she
might be Black Ajah, after all; they had stolen dream <em>
ter&rsquo;angreal</em>&mdash;but balancing the risk of being found
out, even captured, against the fact that she could tell no one
anything she learned, not until she could talk to Nynaeve and
Elayne again, not unless she discovered something so dire that
everything depended on it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;after all, the Black Ajah was Aes
Sedai business; quite aside from any other reasons for keeping
secrets, she could not tell just anyone. It was no choice at
all.</p>

<p>Absently, she studied the nearest lights in the
blackness. She did not recognize any of them. They held absolutely
still around her, shimmering stars frozen in clear black ice.</p>

<p>There were too many strangers in the World of Dreams
lately to suit her peace of mind. Two, but that was two too many.
The copper-skinned woman and another, a sturdily pretty woman who
moved with a purposeful stride, blue-eyed and with a determined
face. The determined woman, as Egwene thought of her, must be able
to enter <em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> on her own&mdash;she
seemed solid, not carved from fog&mdash;and whoever she was, for
whatever reason she was there, she was about the Tower more often
than Nynaeve and Elayne and Sheriam and the rest put together. She
seemed to appear everywhere. In addition to the Tower, she had
nearly surprised Egwene on her last trip to Tear. Not on a meeting
night, of course; the woman had been stalking about the Heart of
the Stone muttering to herself angrily. And she had been in Caemlyn
on Egwene&rsquo;s last two trips.</p>

<p>The chances the determined woman was Black Ajah were
as great as with the other, but then again, either could be from
Salidar. Or both, though Egwene had never seen them together, or
with anyone from Salidar. For that matter, either could be from the
Tower itself. Divisions enough there for one side to be spying on
another, and sooner or later the Tower Aes Sedai would learn of
<em>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em> if they had not already. The two
strangers presented nothing but questions without answers. The only
thing Egwene could think to do was avoid them.</p>

<p>Of course, she tried to avoid everyone in the World
of Dreams of late. She had taken to looking over her shoulder, to
thinking somebody was sneaking up behind her, to seeing things. She
thought she had caught glimpses of Rand, of Perrin, even Lan,
half-seen out of the corner of her eye. Imagination, of course, or
maybe the chance touch of their dreams, but on top of everything
else, it had her jumpy as a cat in a dogyard.</p>

<p>She frowned&mdash;or would have, had she a face. One
of those lights looked&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;not familiar; she did not know it. But
it seemed to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;attract her. Wherever her gaze shifted, it came
back to that same sparkling pinpoint.</p>

<p>Perhaps she could try finding Salidar again. That
meant waiting for Nynaeve and Elayne to leave <em>
Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</em>&mdash;she knew their dreams by
sight, of course; in her sleep, she thought with a silent giggle&mdash;and so far, a dozen attempts to locate Salidar that way had
produced as much result as trying to get through the ward around
Rand&rsquo;s dreams. Distance and location here really bore no
relation to anything in the waking world; Amys said there was no
distance or location here. On the other hand, it was as good as any&mdash;</p>

<p>Startlingly, the pinpoint her gaze kept returning to
began to drift toward her, swelling until what had been a distant
star quickly became a full white moon. A spark of fear lit inside
her. Touching a dream, peeking inside, was easy&mdash;a finger to
the surface of water, a touch so light that the water rose to the
finger but the surface was never broken&mdash;yet it was all
supposed to be at her volition. A dreamwalker sought the dream; the
dream did not seek her. She willed it to go away, willed the starry
scape to move. Only that one light moved, expanding to fill her
vision with white light.</p>

<p>Frantically she tried to pull away. White light.
Nothing but white light, absorbing her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She blinked, staring in amazement. Around her
stretched a forest of great white columns. Most of it seemed fuzzy,
indistinct, especially what was far away, but one thing sharp and
real was Gawyn, trotting across the white-tiled floor toward her in
a plain green coat, anxiety and relief mingled on his face. It was
nearly Gawyn&rsquo;s face, anyway. Gawyn might not be as gorgeous as
his half-brother Galad, but he was still a handsome man, yet this
face seemed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;ordinary. She tried to move and could not, not to
any extent. Her back was to one of the columns, and chains held her
wrists above her head.</p>

<p>This must be Gawyn&rsquo;s dream. Out of all of those
countless points of light, she had stopped near his. And somehow
been drawn in. How was a question for later. Now she wanted to know
why he would dream of holding her captive. Firmly she fixed the
truth in her mind. This was a dream, someone else&rsquo;s dream. She
was herself, not whatever it was he wanted her to be. She did not
accept the reality of anything here. Nothing here touched the true
her. Those truths repeated like a chant in her head. It made
thinking of anything else difficult, but so long as she held them
hard she could risk staying. At least, long enough to find out what
peculiar oddities the man had rolling around in his head. Holding
her captive!</p>

<p>Abruptly a huge gout of flame bloomed on the floor
tiles, and acrid yellow smoke billowed. Rand stepped out of that
inferno garbed in gold-embroidered red like a king, facing Gawyn,
and the fire and smoke vanished. Only it hardly seemed Rand at all.
The real Rand was of a height and size with Gawyn, but this image
overtopped Gawyn by a head. The face was just vaguely Rand&rsquo;s,
coarser and harder than it should be, the cold face of a murderer.
This man wore a sneer. &ldquo;You will not have her,&rdquo; he snarled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not keep her,&rdquo; Gawyn replied calmly, and
suddenly both men held swords.</p>

<p>Egwene gaped. Not Gawyn holding her prisoner. He
dreamed of rescuing her! From Rand! Time to leave this madness. She
concentrated on being <em>outside</em>, back in the darkness,
looking at this from the <em>outside</em>. Nothing happened.</p>

<p>Swords met with a clash, and the two men danced a
deadly dance. Deadly if it had not been a dream, anyway. It was all
nonsense. Dreaming a swordfight, of all things. And it was not a
nightmare; everything looked normal, if fuzzy, not washed in color.
 &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s dreams are a maze even he cannot know,&rdquo; Bair had told
her once.</p>

<p>Egwene closed her eyes, focused her entire mind.
Outside. She was outside, looking in. No room for anything else in
her head. Outside, looking in. Outside, looking in. Outside!</p>

<p>She opened her eyes once more. The fight was reaching
its climax. Gawyn&rsquo;s blade drove into Rand&rsquo;s chest, and as
Rand sagged, the steel pulled free, swept in a shining arc.
Rand&rsquo;s head spun across the floor almost to her feet; it came
to rest staring up at her. A scream bubbled in her throat before
she could quell it. A dream. Just a dream. But those dead staring
eyes seemed very real.</p>

<p>Then Gawyn was in front of her, sword back in its
scabbard. Rand&rsquo;s head and body were gone. Gawyn reached for
the manacles holding her, and they were gone, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew you would come,&rdquo; she breathed, and gave a
start. She was herself! She could not give in to this, not for a
moment, or she would be well and truly trapped.</p>

<p>Smiling, Gawyn scooped her up into his arms. &ldquo;I am
glad you knew it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I would have come sooner if I could. I
should never have left you in danger so long. Can you forgive
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can forgive you anything.&rdquo; There were two Egwenes
now, one snuggling contentedly in Gawyn&rsquo;s arms as he carried
her down a palace corridor lined with colorful tapestries and great
mirrors in ornately gilded frames, the other riding in the back of
the first&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>This was becoming serious. Concentrate as hard as she
would on being outside, she stayed there, watching through the eyes
of a second her. Hurriedly she stifled curiosity as to what Gawyn
dreamed about her. That sort of interest was dangerous. She
accepted none of this! But none of it changed.</p>

<p>The corridor appeared quite real where she looked,
though what was seen from the corner of her eye seemed hazy. Her
own image glimpsed in a mirror caught her attention; she would have
twisted to stare at it as they passed, but she was only a passenger
in the head of the woman of Gawyn&rsquo;s dreams. The woman
reflected for that instant had been her&mdash;there was no feature
she could have pointed to and said it differed in the slightest
from her real face&mdash;but somehow the whole was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;beautiful
was the only word. Stunningly so. Was that how Gawyn saw her?</p>

<p>No! No curiosity! Outside!</p>

<p>Between one stride and the next the corridor became a
hillside carpeted in wildflowers, their scent rich on a soft
breeze. The real Egwene gave a mental start. Had she done that? The
barrier between her and the other thinned. She focused furiously.
It was not real; she refused to accept it; she was herself.
Outside. She wanted to be outside, looking in.</p>

<p>Gently Gawyn laid her down on a cloak already spread
there on the hillside, in the manner of things in dreams. Kneeling
beside her, he brushed a strand of hair from her cheek, let his
fingers trail back to the corner of her mouth. Focusing on anything
was very hard. She might have no control over the body she rode in,
but she felt what it did, and his fingers seemed to make sparks
jump.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My heart is yours,&rdquo; he intoned softly, &ldquo;my soul, my
everything.&rdquo; His coat was scarlet now, elaborately worked in gold
leaves and silver lions. He made grand gestures, touching head or
heart. &ldquo;When I think of you, there is no room for any other
thought. Your perfume fills my brain and sets my blood afire. My
heart pounds till I could not hear the world crack apart. You are
my sun and my moon and my stars, my heaven and earth, more precious
to me than, life or breath or&mdash;&rdquo; Abruptly he stopped,
grimacing. &ldquo;You sound a fool,&rdquo; he muttered to himself.</p>

<p>Egwene would have disagreed had she had any control
over her vocal cords. It was very nice hearing those things, even
if they were a bit over the top. Just a bit.</p>

<p>When he grimaced, she felt a loosening, but</p>

<p><em>Flick.</em></p>

<p>Gently Gawyn laid her down on a cloak already spread
there on the hillside, in the manner of things in dreams. Kneeling
beside her, he brushed a strand of hair from her cheek, let his
fingers trail back to the corner of her mouth. She might have no
control over the body she rode in, but she could feel what it felt,
and his fingers seemed to make sparks jump.</p>

<p>No! She could not let herself accept any part of his
dream!</p>

<p>His face was a map of pain, his coat stark gray. His
hands rested on his knees in fists. &ldquo;I have no right to speak to
you as I might wish,&rdquo; he said stiffly. &ldquo;My brother loves you. I
know Galad is in agony with fear for you. He is a Whitecloak at
least half because he thinks the Aes Sedai have misused you. I know
he&mdash;&rdquo; Gawyn&rsquo;s eyes squeezed shut. &ldquo;Oh, Light, help me!&rdquo;
he moaned.</p>

<p><em>Flick.</em></p>

<p>Gently Gawyn laid her down on a cloak already spread
there on the hillside, in the manner of things in dreams. Kneeling
beside her, he brushed a strand of hair from her cheek, let his
fingers trail back to the corner of her mouth.</p>

<p>No! She was losing the little control she had!
She had to get out! <em>What are you afraid of?</em> She was not
sure whether that was her thought or the other Egwene&rsquo;s. The
barrier between them was gauze now. <em>This is Gawyn.
Gawyn</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he said hesitantly. In the green coat
again, still less handsome than he really was, he plucked at one of
his buttons before letting his hand drop. He looked at her as
though afraid of what he might see on her face, hiding it, but not
well. &ldquo;I have never said that to another woman, never wanted to say
it. You have no idea how hard it is to say to you. Not that I
don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; he added hastily, flinging a hand toward her,
 &ldquo;but to say it, with no encouragement, is like tossing aside my
sword and baring my chest for a blade. Not that I think you would&mdash;Light! I can&rsquo;t say this properly. Is there any chance
that you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;might come&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;in time&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to feel some&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;regard&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;for me? Something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;more than friendship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sweet idiot,&rdquo; she laughed softly. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;
<em>I love you</em>, echoed in the part of her that was really her.
She felt the barrier vanishing, had a moment to realize she did not
care, and then there was only one Egwene again, an Egwene who
happily twined her arms around Gawyn&rsquo;s neck.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Sitting on the stool in the dim moonlight, Nynaeve
stuffed a yawn back into her mouth with her knuckles and blinked
eyes that felt full of sand. This was going to work; oh, yes, it
was. She would fall asleep saying hello to Theodrin, if not before!
Her chin sank, and she jerked herself to her feet. The stool had
begun feeling like stone&mdash;her bottom had gone numb&mdash;but
that discomfort was apparently not enough anymore. Perhaps a walk
outside. Arms outstretched, she felt her way to the door.</p>

<p>Abruptly a distant scream shattered the night, and as
it did, the stool struck her hard in the back, knocking her against
the rough door with a startled scream of her own. Stunned, she
stared at the stool, lying on its side on the floor now, one leg
shoved awry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Elayne cried, coming bolt upright in
her bed.</p>

<p>More screams and shouts sounded through Salidar, some
from inside their own house, and a vague rumble and clatter that
seemed to come from everywhere. Nynaeve&rsquo;s empty bed rattled,
then slid a foot across the floor. Elayne&rsquo;s heaved, nearly
tossing her out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bubble of evil.&rdquo; Nynaeve was startled at how cool
she sounded. There was no point leaping about and flapping her
arms, but inside she was doing just that. &ldquo;We have to wake anybody
who&rsquo;s still asleep.&rdquo; She did not know how anyone could sleep
through this racket, but those who did could die before they knew
it.</p>

<p>Not waiting for a reply, she hurried out and pushed
open the next door down the hall&mdash;and ducked as a white
washbasin hurtled through the space where her head had been to
smash against the wall behind her. Four women shared this room, in
two beds a little larger than her own. Now one bed lay with its
legs in the air, two women trying to crawl from beneath it. On the
other, Emara and Ronelle, another Accepted, thrashed and made
choking sounds, wrapped tight in their own bedsheet.</p>

<p>Nynaeve grabbed the first woman out from under the
overturned bed, a gaping skinny serving woman named Mulinda, and
shoved her toward the door. &ldquo;Go! Wake anybody in the house still
sleeping, and help anybody you can! Go!&rdquo; Mulinda went, stumbling,
and Nynaeve hauled her trembling sleeping companion to her feet.
 &ldquo;Help me, Satina. Help me with Emara and Ronelle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trembling she might have been, but the plump woman
nodded and set to with a will. It was not just a matter of
unwinding the sheet, of course. The thing seemed alive, like a vine
that would tighten until it crushed what it held. Nynaeve and
Satina together barely peeled it away from the two women&rsquo;s
throats; then the pitcher leaped from the washstand to crash
against the ceiling, Satina jumped and lost her hold, and the sheet
snapped out of Nynaeve&rsquo;s hands, right back where it had been.
The two women&rsquo;s struggles were weakening; one made a rattling
noise in her throat, the other no sound at all. Even by the little
moonlight that came through the window their faces seemed swollen
and dark.</p>

<p>Seizing the sheet again with both hands, Nynaeve
opened herself to <em>saidar</em>, and found nothing. <em>I&rsquo;m
surrendering, burn you! I am surrendering! I need the Power!</em>
Nothing. The bed shimmied against her knees, and Satina squeaked.
 &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just stand there!&rdquo; Nynaeve snapped. &ldquo;Help me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abruptly the sheet jerked out of her grip once more,
but instead of winding around Emara and Ronelle again, it pulled
the other way so hard they tumbled over one another, nearly
blurring as it unwound. Noticing Elayne in the doorway, Nynaeve
closed her mouth with a click of teeth. The sheet hung from the
ceiling. The Power. Of course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s awake,&rdquo; Elayne said, handing her a
robe. She already had one over her own shift. &ldquo;A few bruises and
scrapes, one or two nasty cuts to be seen to when there&rsquo;s
time, and I think <em>everybody</em> is going to have bad dreams
for a few days, but that&rsquo;s the extent of it. Here.&rdquo; Screams
and shouts still rang through the night. Satina jumped again as
Elayne let the sheet fall, but it just lay there on the floor. The
overturned bed shifted, though, creaking. Elayne bent over the
groaning women on the bed. &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re dizzy, mainly.
Satina, help me get them on their feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve glowered at the robe in her hands. Well they
might be dizzy, spun about like tops. Light, but she was useless.
Rushing in like a fool to take charge. Without the Power, she was
just useless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nynaeve, could you give me a hand?&rdquo; Elayne held a
swaying Emara upright, while Satina was more than half-carrying
Ronelle to the door. &ldquo;I think Emara&rsquo;s going to sick up, and it
better be outside. I think the chamber pots are broken.&rdquo; The smell
said she was right. Pottery grated against the floor, trying to
slither out from under the overturned bed.</p>

<p>Nynaeve thrust her arms angrily into her robe. She
could sense the Source now, a warm glow just out of sight, but she
deliberately ignored it. She had done without the Power for years.
She could do without it now. Lifting Emara&rsquo;s free arm over her
shoulder, she helped guide the moaning woman toward the street.
They almost made it.</p>

<p>When they got outside after wiping Emara&rsquo;s
mouth, everyone else was already huddled together in front of the
house in robes or whatever they had slept in. The still full moon,
hanging in a clear sky, gave a bright light. People were spilling
out of the other houses in a bedlam of bellows and shrieks. One
board in a fence rattled, then another. A bucket suddenly went
bouncing down the street. A cart loaded with firewood abruptly
rolled forward, shafts plowing shallow furrows in the hard ground.
Smoke began to rise a house down the way, and voices began shouting
for water.</p>

<p>The dark shape of someone lying in the street drew
Nynaeve. One of the night watchmen, by the flickering lantern near
his outstretched hand. She could see his staring eyes glittering in
the moonlight, the blood covering his face, the dent in the side of
his head where something had struck him like an axe. She felt his
throat for a pulse anyway. She wanted to howl with fury. People
should die after a long life, in their own beds, surrounded by
family and friends. Anything else was waste. Pure miserable
waste!</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve found <em>saidar</em> tonight,
Nynaeve. Good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nynaeve jumped, and stared up at Anaiya. She did hold
<em>saidar</em>, she realized. And useless even with it. Rising,
she wearily dusted her knees and tried not to look at the dead man.
If she had been quicker, could it have made a difference?</p>

<p>The glow of the Power surrounded Anaiya, but not only
her; the single light enveloped as well two more fully clothed Aes
Sedai, an Accepted in a robe, and three novices, two in their
shifts. One of those in her shift was Nicola. Nynaeve could see
other glowing groups, dozens and dozens of them, moving in the
street. Some seemed all Aes Sedai, but most not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open yourself to linking,&rdquo; Anaiya went on. &ldquo;And you,
Elayne, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;what is wrong with Emara and Ronelle?&rdquo; On
learning they were just dizzy, she muttered something under her
breath, then told them to find a circle and link with it as soon as
their heads were steady. Hurriedly she chose out four more Accepted
from the cluster around Elayne. &ldquo;Sammael&mdash;if it is him
instead of one of the others&mdash;will learn we are far from
helpless. Quickly now. Embrace the Source, but hold yourself at the
point of embracing. You are open and yielding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t one of the Forsaken,&rdquo; Nynaeve began,
but the motherly Aes Sedai cut her off firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t argue, child, just open yourself. We have
expected an attack, if not exactly like this, and planned for it.
Quickly, child. There is no time to squander on idle chatter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Snapping her mouth shut, Nynaeve tried to put herself
on that brink where you embraced <em>saidar</em>, on the moment of
surrender. It was not easy. Twice she felt the Power flow not just
into her, but through her into Anaiya, and twice it snapped back.
Anaiya&rsquo;s mouth tightened; she stared at Nynaeve as though
thinking she did it on purpose. The third time was like being
seized by the scruff of the neck. <em>Saidar</em> swept through
Nynaeve to Anaiya, and when she attempted to pull back&mdash;it
was her, she realized, not the flow itself&mdash;her flow was
held, melting into a larger.</p>

<p>A sense of awe came over her. She found herself
looking at the faces of the others, wondering if they felt the
same. She was a part of something more than herself, greater than
herself. Not just the One Power. Emotions tumbled in her head, fear
and hope and relief&mdash;and yes, awe, more than any other&mdash;a sense of calm that had to come from the Aes Sedai, and she could
not tell which emotions were hers. It should have been chilling,
but she felt closer to these women than she could have to any
sister, as if they were all one flesh. A lanky Gray named
Ashmanaille smiled warmly at her, seemingly recognizing her
thoughts.</p>

<p>Nynaeve&rsquo;s breath caught as it occurred to her
that she no longer felt angry. Anger had vanished, swallowed in
wonder. Yet somehow, now that control had passed to the Blue
sister, the flow of <em>saidar</em> continued. Her eyes fell on
Nicola and found no sisterly smile, only that considering study.
Reflexively Nynaeve tried to pull back from the link, and nothing
happened. Until Anaiya broke the circle she was part of it, and
that was that.</p>

<p>Elayne joined much more easily, first slipping the
silver bracelet into her robe&rsquo;s pocket. Cold sweat broke out
on Nynaeve&rsquo;s face. What might have happened had Elayne entered
the link already linked to Moghedien by the <em>a&rsquo;dam</em>?
She had no notion, which only made the question worse. Nicola
frowned from Nynaeve to Elayne. Surely she could not separate out
which emotions were which, not when Nynaeve could not tell her own.
The final two were brought into the circle just as easily, Shimoku,
a pretty dark-eyed Kandori who had become Accepted just before the
Tower divided, and Calindin, a Taraboner with her black hair in a
multitude of thin braids who had been Accepted for a good ten
years. A woman little more than a novice and another who struggled
for every scrap she learned, but they had no trouble linking.</p>

<p>Suddenly Nicola spoke, sounding half-asleep. &ldquo;The
lion sword, the dedicated spear, she who sees beyond. Three on the
boat, and he who is dead yet lives. The great battle done, but the
world not done with battle. The land divided by the return, and the
guardians balance the servants. The future teeters on the edge of a
blade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anaiya stared at her. &ldquo;What was that, child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nicola blinked. &ldquo;Did I say something, Aes Sedai?&rdquo; she
asked weakly. &ldquo;I feel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;peculiar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re going to be sick,&rdquo; Anaiya said
briskly, &ldquo;get it over with. Linking takes some women funny the
first time. We have no time to coddle your stomach.&rdquo; As if to prove
it, she gathered her skirts and started down the street. &ldquo;Stay
close, now, all of you. And sing out if you see something that
needs dealing with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was hardly a problem. People milled about in the
streets and things moved. Doors slammed and windows banged open
with no one touching them. Crashes and splinterings came from
inside the houses. Pots, tools, stones, anything loose, might leap
or dart at any moment. A stout cook in her shift snagged a hurtling
bucket out of the air with a nearly hysterical laugh, but when a
pale lean fellow in his smallclothes tried to knock away a stick of
firewood, the result was the crack of his arm breaking. Ropes
writhed their way about legs and arms, and even people&rsquo;s
clothes began to crawl. They found a hairy man with his shirt
wrapped around his head, flailing about so hard he kept at bay
those who were trying to peel it away before it smothered him. A
woman who had managed to pull on a dress if not fasten it up clung
to the thatch on the edge of a roof, shrieking at the top of her
lungs as the dress tried to haul her across the house, or maybe
into the sky.</p>

<p>Dealing with these things proved no more problem than
finding them. The flows of Power Anaiya wielded through the link&mdash;and those from other circles&mdash;would have had no
trouble stopping a herd of charging bulls, much less a kettle that
took it in mind to fly. And once a thing was stopped, whether by
the Power or by hand, it seldom stirred again. There were just so
many of them. There was not even time to stop for Healing unless a
life was in danger; bruises, bleeding and broken bones had to wait
while another fence-board was slapped to the ground, hopefully
before it split a head; another barrel halted in its wild rolling,
before it broke a leg.</p>

<p>A sense of frustration grew in Nynaeve. So many
things to quell; all small, but a man with his skull cracked by a
frying pan or a woman strangled by her own shift was as dead as
someone struck down by the Power. It was not just her frustration;
she thought it came from every woman in the circle, even the Aes
Sedai. But all she could do was march along with the others, watch
Anaiya weave the combination of their flows to battle a thousand
small dangers. Nynaeve lost herself in being a conduit, in being
one with a dozen other women.</p>

<p>Finally Anaiya halted, frowning. The link dissolving
caught Nynaeve by surprise. For a moment she sagged where she
stood, staring uncomprehendingly. Moans and weeping had replaced
screams and shouts; the palely lit street was still except for
people trying to help the injured. By the moon, less than an hour
had passed, but it seemed to Nynaeve like ten. Her back ached where
the stool had hit her, her knees wobbled, her eyes felt scrubbed.
She yawned so hard she thought her ears would pop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all what I expected from one of the
Forsaken,&rdquo; Anaiya muttered only half under her breath. She sounded
tired too, but she launched right into the next thing to be done,
catching Nicola by the shoulder. &ldquo;You can hardly stand. Bed for
you. Off you go, child. I want to speak to you first thing in the
morning, before breakfast. Angla, you stay; you can link again and
lend a little strength for the Healing. Lanita, bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t the Forsaken,&rdquo; Nynaeve said. Mumbled,
really. Light, she was tired. &ldquo;It was a bubble of evil.&rdquo; The three
Aes Sedai stared at her. For that matter, so did the rest of the
Accepted, except for Elayne, and the novices too. Even Nicola, who
had not yet gone. For once, Nynaeve did not care how much the woman
weighed her with her eyes; she was too sleepy to care.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We saw one in Tear,&rdquo; Elayne said, &ldquo;in the Stone.&rdquo;
Only the aftermath, really, but that was closer than either of them
had ever hoped to be again. &ldquo;If Sammael attacked us, he
wouldn&rsquo;t toss sticks about.&rdquo; Ashmanaille exchanged unreadable
glances with Bharatine, a Green who managed to make rail-thin look
gracefully slender and a long nose look elegant.</p>

<p>Anaiya never flickered an eyelid. &ldquo;You seem to have
plenty of energy left, Elayne. You can help with the Healing, too.
And you, Nynaeve&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;you&rsquo;ve lost it again, haven&rsquo;t you?
Well, you look as if you ought to be carried to bed, but you will
have to find your own way. Shimoku, stand up and go to bed, child.
Calindin, you come with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anaiya Sedai,&rdquo; Nynaeve said carefully, &ldquo;Elayne and I
found something tonight. If we could speak to you alo&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow, child. To bed with you. Now, before you
fall down.&rdquo; Anaiya did not even wait to see whether she was obeyed.
Drawing Calindin after her, she strode to a groaning man lying with
his head in a woman&rsquo;s lap and bent over him. Ashmanaille
pulled Elayne another way, and Bharatine took Angla a third. Before
she vanished into the crowd, Elayne looked over her shoulder at
Nynaeve and shook her head slightly.</p>

<p>Well, perhaps this was not the best time or place to
bring up the bowl and Ebou Dar. There had been something odd in
Anaiya&rsquo;s reaction, as though she would be disappointed to
learn this truly had not been an attack by the Forsaken. Why? She
was too tired to think straight. Anaiya might have controlled the
flows, but <em>saidar</em> had passed through Nynaeve for a good
hour, enough to weary someone who had had a good night&rsquo;s
sleep.</p>

<p>Swaying, Nynaeve caught sight of Theodrin. The Domani
woman limped along with a pair of white-clad novices at her side,
pausing where someone seemed to have an injury her skill at Healing
could handle. She did not see Nynaeve.</p>

<p><em>I will go to bed</em>, Nynaeve thought sullenly,
<em>Anaiya Sedai told me to</em>. Why had Anaiya seemed
disappointed? Some thought nuzzled at the corner of her mind, but
she was too sleepy to catch it. Her steps dragged, nearly stumbling
on level ground. She <em>would</em> go to sleep, and Theodrin could
make of it what she wanted.</p>
