paid scant attention as Rand instructed a
Maiden, &ldquo;Tell Sulin to prepare rooms for Perrin and Faile and obey
them as she would me.&rdquo; The two Aiel women took that as some sort of
great joke, from the way they laughed and slapped thighs, but
Perrin was staring at a slender man standing a little way down the
tapestry-hung corridor. He had no doubt at all that the man was
Davram Bashere. It was not just that he was Saldaean, and he surely
looked nothing like Faile with those thick gray-streaked mustaches
curving down to almost hide his mouth. He was no taller than Faile
either, maybe a little shorter, but the way he stood, arms folded,
face like a hawk staring down into a henyard, made Perrin certain.
The man knew; that was certain, too.</p>

<p>Making last goodbyes to Rand, Perrin took a deep
breath and walked up the hallway. He found himself wishing he had
his axe; Bashere was wearing his sword. &ldquo;Lord Bashere?&rdquo; Perrin made
a bow that was not returned. The man reeked of cold fury. &ldquo;I am
Perrin Aybara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will talk,&rdquo; Bashere said curtly and turned on his
heel. Perrin had no choice but to follow, and to take quick strides
despite his longer legs.</p>

<p>Two turnings later, Bashere entered a small sitting
room and closed the door behind them. Tall windows let in plenty of
light, and even more heat than the high ceiling could handle. Two
chairs with padded seats and high, scroll-carved backs had been
placed facing each other. A silver pitcher with a tall neck and
two silver cups stood on a lapis-inlaid table. Not punch, this
time; strong wine, by the smell.</p>

<p>Bashere filled the cups and thrust one at Perrin,
gesturing peremptorily to one of the chairs. He wore a smile behind
his mustaches, but eyes and smile could have belonged to two
different men. The eyes could have driven nails. &ldquo;I suppose Zarine
told you all about my estates before you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;married her. All
about the Broken Crown. She was always talkative as a girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man remained standing, so Perrin did as well.
Broken crown? Faile had certainly never mentioned any broken crown.
 &ldquo;First she told me you were a fur trader. Or maybe it was a lumber
merchant first, and then a fur trader. You sold ice peppers, too.&rdquo;
Bashere gave a start, repeating &ldquo;Fur trader?&rdquo; incredulously under
his breath. &ldquo;Her story changed,&rdquo; Perrin went on, &ldquo;but once too
often she repeated something you had said about how a general
should behave, and I asked her straight out, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He peered
into his wine, then made himself meet the other man&rsquo;s eyes.
 &ldquo;When I found out who you were, I almost changed my mind about
marrying her, only she had her mind set, and when Faile has her
mind set, shifting her is like shifting a hitch of mules that have
all decided to sit down at once. Besides, I loved her. I love
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faile?&rdquo; Bashere barked. &ldquo;Who in the Pit of Doom is
Faile? We are talking about my daughter Zarine, and what
you&rsquo;ve done to her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faile is the name she took when she became a Hunter
for the Horn,&rdquo; Perrin said patiently. He had to make a good
impression on this man; being at odds with your father-in-law was
almost as bad as being at odds with your mother-in-law. &ldquo;That was
before she met me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Hunter?&rdquo; Pride shone in the man&rsquo;s voice, and
his sudden grin. The scent of anger almost vanished. &ldquo;The little
minx never said a word to me about that. I must say, Faile suits
her better than Zarine. That was her mother&rsquo;s notion, and I&mdash;&rdquo; Suddenly he gave himself a shake, and Perrin a suspicious
stare. Anger began scenting the air again. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try changing
the subject, boy. What we are about is you and my daughter and this
supposed marriage of yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Supposed?&rdquo; Perrin had always been good at holding
his temper; Mistress Luhhan said he never had one. When you were
bigger and stronger than the other boys growing up, and might hurt
somebody by accident, you learned to hold your temper. Right then
he was having a little difficulty, though. &ldquo;The Wisdom performed
the ceremony, the same as everybody&rsquo;s been married in the Two
Rivers since time out of mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if you had the words
said by an Ogier Elder with six Aes Sedai standing witness. Zarine
<em>still</em> isn&rsquo;t old enough to marry without her
mother&rsquo;s permission, which she never asked, much less
received. She is with Deira right now, and if she doesn&rsquo;t
convince her mother she&rsquo;s old enough to be married, she goes
back to the camp, probably doing duty as her mother&rsquo;s saddle.
And you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Bashere&rsquo;s fingers stroked the hilt of his
sword, though he did not seem aware of it. &ldquo;You,&rdquo; he said in an
almost jolly tone, &ldquo;I get to kill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faile is mine,&rdquo; Perrin growled. Wine slopped over
his wrist, and he looked down in surprise at the winecup, crushed
in his fist. He set the twisted piece of silver on the table
carefully, beside the pitcher, but he could do nothing about his
voice. &ldquo;Nobody can take her from me. Nobody! You take her back to
your camp&mdash;or anywhere!&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll come for
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have nine thousand men with me,&rdquo; the other man
said in a surprisingly mild tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they any harder to kill than Trollocs? Try
taking her&mdash;try!&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll find out!&rdquo; He was
shaking, Perrin realized, his hands clenched into fists so hard
they hurt. It shocked him; he had not been angry, really angry, in
so long that he no longer remembered what it was like.</p>

<p>Bashere studied him up and down, then shook his head.
 &ldquo;It might be a shame to kill you. We need some new blood. It&rsquo;s
getting thin in the House. My grandfather used to say we were all
becoming soft, and he was right. I&rsquo;m half the man he was, and
much as it shames me to say it, Zarine is terribly soft. Not weak,
mind&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He frowned hard for a moment, nodding when he saw
Perrin was not going to say Faile was weak. &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but soft, just
the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that shocked Perrin so, he sat down before he
realized he had moved to the chair. He almost forgot to be angry.
Was this man mad, changing about like that? And Faile, soft? She
could be deliciously soft at times, true, but any man who thought
she was soft in the way her father meant would probably have his
head handed to him. Himself included.</p>

<p>Bashere picked up the crushed winecup, studied it,
then replaced it and took the other chair. &ldquo;Zarine told me a good
bit about you before she went with her mother, all about Lord
Perrin of the Two Rivers, Slayer of Trollocs. That&rsquo;s good,
that. I like a man who can stand toe to toe with a Trolloc and not
back up. Now I want to know what kind of man you are.&rdquo; He waited
expectantly, sipping his wine.</p>

<p>Perrin wished he had some more of Rand&rsquo;s melon
punch, or even his winecup undented. His throat had gone dry. He
wanted to make that good impression, but he had to start with the
truth. &ldquo;The fact of it is, I am not really a lord. I&rsquo;m a
blacksmith. You see, when the Trollocs came&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He trailed off
because Bashere was laughing so hard the man had to wipe his
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy, the Creator never made the Houses. Some forget
it, but go far enough back in any House, and you&rsquo;ll find a
commoner who showed uncommon courage or kept his head and took
charge when everybody else was running around like plucked geese.
Mind you, another thing some like to forget is the road down can be
just as sudden. I&rsquo;ve two maids in Tyr who would be ladies if
their forebears two hundred years ago hadn&rsquo;t been fools even a
fool wouldn&rsquo;t follow, and a woodcutter in Sidona who claims
his ancestors were kings and queens before Artur Hawkwing. He might
be telling the truth; he&rsquo;s a good woodcutter. As many roads
down as up, and the roads down as slippery as the others.&rdquo; Bashere
snorted hard enough to make his mustaches stir. &ldquo;A fool moans when
fortune takes him down, and it takes a true fool to moan when
fortune takes him up. What I want to know about you isn&rsquo;t what
you were, or even so much what you are, as what you are inside. If
my wife leaves Zarine with a whole hide, and I don&rsquo;t kill you,
do you know how to treat a wife? Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mindful of that good impression, Perrin decided not
to explain that he would much rather be a blacksmith again. &ldquo;I
treat Faile as well as I know how,&rdquo; he said carefully.</p>

<p>Bashere snorted again. &ldquo;As well as you know how.&rdquo; His
flat tone became a growl. &ldquo;You had better know well enough, boy, or
I&rsquo;ll&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;you hear me. A wife isn&rsquo;t a trooper to go
running when you shout. In some ways, a woman is like a dove. You
hold her half as hard as you think is necessary, or you might hurt
her. You don&rsquo;t want to hurt Zarine. You understand me?&rdquo; He
grinned suddenly, disconcertingly, and his voice grew almost
friendly. &ldquo;You might do very well for a son-in-law, Aybara, but if
you make her unhappy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He was stroking his sword hilt
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I try to make her happy,&rdquo; Perrin said seriously.
 &ldquo;Hurting her is the last thing I&rsquo;d want to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. Because it would be the last thing you do,
boy.&rdquo; That was delivered with a grin too, but Perrin had no doubts
Bashere meant every word. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time to take you to
Deira. If she and Zarine haven&rsquo;t finished their discussion by
now, best we step in before one of them kills the other. They
always did get a little carried away when they argued, and
Zarine&rsquo;s too big now for Deira to put an end to it by spanking
her.&rdquo; Bashere put his cup on the table, and went on as they started
for the door. &ldquo;One thing you have to be aware of. Just because a
woman says she believes something, doesn&rsquo;t mean it is true.
Oh, she&rsquo;ll believe it, but a thing is not necessarily true
just because a woman believes it is. You keep that in mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo; Perrin thought he understood what the man
meant. Faile sometimes had only a passing acquaintance with the
truth. Never about anything important, or at least not what she
considered important, but if she promised to do something she did
not want to do, she always managed to leave herself a hole to
wriggle through and keep the letter of the promise while doing
exactly as she wished. What he did not understand was what that
could have to do with meeting Faile&rsquo;s mother.</p>

<p>It was a long walk through the Palace, along
colonnades and up flights of stairs. There did not seem to be many
Saldaeans about, but a good many Aielmen and Maidens, not to
mention red-and-white-liveried servants, who bowed or curtsied, and
white-robed men and women like those who had taken the horses.
Those last scurried along with trays or armloads of toweling, eyes
down, and seemed to take no notice of anyone. With a start Perrin
realized that a number of them wore the same length of scarlet
cloth around their temples that many of the Aielmen did. They must
be Aiel, too. He noticed a small thing as well. As many women as
men in the white robes wore the headband, and men in the drab coats
and breeches, but no Maidens that he saw. Gaul had told him a
little about the Aiel, but he had never mentioned the
headbands.</p>

<p>As he and Bashere entered a room with ivory-inlaid
chairs and small tables set on a patterned carpet of red and gold
and green, Perrin&rsquo;s ears picked up the muffled sound of
women&rsquo;s voices raised in an inner room. He could not make out
words through the thick door, but he could tell that one of them
was Faile. Abruptly there was a slap, followed almost immediately
by another, and he winced. Only a complete wool-head stepped
between his wife and her mother when they were arguing&mdash;by
what he had seen, usually they both rounded on the poor fool&mdash;and he knew very well that Faile could stand up for herself in
normal circumstances. But then again, he had seen strong women,
themselves mothers and even grandmothers, allow themselves to be
treated like children by their own mothers.</p>

<p>Squaring his shoulders, he strode for the inner door,
but Bashere was there before, rapping with his knuckles as if they
had all the time in the world. Of course, Bashere could not hear
what sounded to Perrin like two cats in a sack. Wet cats.</p>

<p>Bashere&rsquo;s rap cut off the snarling as though
with a knife. &ldquo;You may come,&rdquo; a composed voice said loudly.</p>

<p>It was all Perrin could do not to push past Bashere,
and once he was inside, his eyes sought out Faile anxiously, where
she sat in a wide-armed chair just where the light from the windows
became less sharp. The carpet was mostly dark red in here, making
him think of blood, and one of the two wall hangings showed a woman
on horseback killing a leopard with a spear. The other was a
furious battle swirling around a White Lion banner. Her scent was a
jumble of emotions he could not separate, and her left cheek bore a
red handprint, but she smiled at him, if faintly.</p>

<p>Faile&rsquo;s mother made Perrin blink. With all
Bashere&rsquo;s talk of doves, he expected a fragile woman, but Lady
Deira stood inches taller than her husband, and she was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;statuesque. Not big like Mistress Luhhan, who was round, or like
Daise Congar, who looked as if she could take over a
blacksmith&rsquo;s hammer. She was buxom, which a man certainly
should not think of his mother-in-law, and he could see where Faile
got her beauty. Faile&rsquo;s face was her mother&rsquo;s face,
without the slash of white through her dark hair on her temples. If
that was how Faile would look when she reached that age, he was a
very fortunate man. On the other hand, that bold nose gave Lady
Deira the look of an eagle as those dark tilted eyes fastened on
him, a fiery-eyed eagle ready to sink talons deep into a
particularly insolent rabbit. She smelled of fury and contempt. The
real surprise, though, was the crimson handprint on her cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father, we were just talking of you,&rdquo; Faile said
with an affectionate smile, gliding to him and taking his hands.
She kissed his cheeks, and Perrin felt a sudden stab of
disgruntlement; a father did not deserve all that when there was a
husband standing right there with only one brief smile to sustain
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should I ride away and hide then, Zarine?&rdquo; Bashere
chuckled. Oh, a very rich chuckle. The man did not even seem to see
that his wife and daughter had hit each other!</p>

<p>&ldquo;She prefers Faile, Davram,&rdquo; Lady Deira said
absently. Arms folded beneath that ample bosom, she eyed Perrin up
and down without any effort to disguise it.</p>

<p>He heard Faile whisper softly to her father, &ldquo;It
depends on him, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin supposed it did, if she and her mother had
come to blows. Squaring his shoulders, he prepared to tell Lady
Deira that he would be as gentle with Faile as if she were a
kitten, that he himself would be meek as a lamb. The last part
would be a lie, of course&mdash;Faile would spit a meek man and
roast him for dinner&mdash;but peace had to be maintained.
Besides, he did try to be gentle with her. Maybe the Lady Deira was
why Bashere talked so about gentleness; no man would have the nerve
to be anything else with this woman.</p>

<p>Before he could open his mouth, Faile&rsquo;s mother
said, &ldquo;Yellow eyes do not make a wolf. Are you strong enough to
handle my daughter, young man? From what she tells me, you&rsquo;re
a milksop, indulging her every whim, letting her twine you around
her fingers whenever she wants to play cat&rsquo;s cradle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perrin stared. Bashere had taken the chair Faile had
been sitting in, and now he was complacently studying his boots,
one propped atop the toe of the other. Faile, seated on the broad
arm of her father&rsquo;s chair, gave her mother one indignant
frown, then smiled at Perrin with all the confidence she had showed
when telling him to stand up to Rand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she twists me around her finger,&rdquo;
he said carefully. She tried, true, but he did not think he had
ever let her. Except once in a while, to please her.</p>

<p>Lady Deira&rsquo;s sniff spoke volumes. &ldquo;Weaklings
never think so. A woman wants a strong man, stronger than
she, here.&rdquo; Her finger poked his chest hard enough to make him
grunt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget the first time Davram took me by the
scruff of the neck and showed me he was the stronger of us. It was
magnificent!&rdquo; Perrin blinked; that was an image his mind could not
hold. &ldquo;If a woman is stronger than her husband, she comes to
despise him. She has the choice of either tyrannizing him or else
making herself less in order not to make him less. If the husband
is strong enough, though&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She poked him again, even harder.
 &ldquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she can be as strong as she is, as strong as she can grow
to be. You will have to prove to Faile that you&rsquo;re strong.&rdquo;
Another poke, harder still. &ldquo;The women of my family are leopards.
If you cannot train her to hunt on your command, Faile will rake
you as you deserve. Are you strong enough?&rdquo; This time her finger
drove Perrin back a step.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you stop that?&rdquo; he growled. He refrained from
rubbing his chest. Faile was giving no help at all, merely smiling
at him encouragingly. Bashere was studying him with pursed lips and
a cocked eyebrow. &ldquo;If I indulge her sometimes, it&rsquo;s because I
want to. I like to see her smile. If you expect me to trample on
her, you can forget it.&rdquo; Maybe he had lost with that. Faile&rsquo;s
mother began staring at him in a most peculiar way, and her scent
was a tangle he could not make out, though anger was still in it,
and icy disdain. But good impression or no, he was done with trying
to say what Bashere and his wife wanted to hear. &ldquo;I love her, and
she loves me, and that&rsquo;s the whole of it as far as I&rsquo;m
concerned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says,&rdquo; Bashere said slowly, &ldquo;that if you take our
daughter away, he will take her back. He seems to think nine
thousand Saldaean horse no match for a few hundred Two Rivers
bowmen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His wife gazed at Perrin consideringly, then visibly
took herself in hand, her head coming erect. &ldquo;That is all very
well, but any man can swing a sword. What I want to know is whether
he can tame a willful, headstrong, disobedient&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough, Deira,&rdquo; Bashere cut in mildly. &ldquo;Since
you&rsquo;ve obviously decided Zarine&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Faile&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;is no longer
a child, I think Perrin will do well enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To Perrin&rsquo;s surprise, Bashere&rsquo;s wife bowed
her head meekly. &ldquo;As you say, my heart.&rdquo; Then she glared at Perrin,
not meekly at all, as if to say that was the way a man should
handle a woman.</p>

<p>Bashere murmured something under his breath about
grandchildren and making the blood strong again. And Faile? She
smiled at Perrin with an expression he had never seen on her face
before, an expression that made him decidedly uncomfortable. With
her hands folded and her ankles crossed and her head tilted to one
side, she somehow managed to look&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;submissive. Faile! Maybe he
had married into a family where <em>every</em>one was mad.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Closing the door on Perrin, Rand finished his goblet
of punch, then sprawled in a chair, thinking. He hoped Perrin got
on well with Bashere. But then, if they struck sparks, maybe Perrin
would be more amenable to Tear. He needed either Perrin or Mat
there to convince Sammael that that was the true attack. The
thought brought a soft, bitter laugh. Light, what a way to think
about a friend. Lews Therin was giggling and muttering indistinctly
about friends and betrayal. Rand wished he could sleep for a
year.</p>

<p>Min entered without knocking or being announced, of
course. The Maidens sometimes looked at her oddly, but whatever
Sulin had said, or maybe Melaine, Min was now on the short list of
those sent on in whatever he was doing. She took advantage, too;
once already she had insisted on taking a stool beside his bathtub
and talking as if nothing were out of the ordinary at all. Now she
just paused to fill herself a goblet of punch and dropped into his
lap with a little bounce. A faint sheen of sweat glistened on her
face. She would not even try to learn how to ignore the heat, just
laughing and saying she was not Aes Sedai and had no plans to be.
He had become her favorite chair for these visits, it seemed, but
he was certain if he merely pretended not to notice, she would give
up her game sooner or later. That was why he had hid as best he
could in his bath water instead of blindfolding her with Air. Once
she knew she was affecting him, she would never stop the joke.
Besides, much as it shamed him to admit it about Min, having a girl
on his knees did feel nice. He was not made of wood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you have a good talk with Faile?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t last long. Her father came and got
her, and she was too busy flinging arms around his neck to notice
me. I went for a little walk after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t like her?&rdquo; he said, and Min&rsquo;s
eyes widened, her lashes making them look even larger. Women never
expected a man to see or understand anything they did not want him
to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that I dislike her exactly,&rdquo; she said,
drawing the words out. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, she wants what
she wants when she wants it, and she will not take no for an
answer. I pity poor Perrin, married to her. Do you know what she
wanted with me? To make sure I had no designs on her precious
husband. You may not have noticed&mdash;men never see these things&mdash;&rdquo; She cut off, looking up at him suspiciously through those
long lashes. He had showed he could see some things, after all.
Once she was satisfied he did not mean to laugh, or bring it up,
she went on. &ldquo;I could see at a glance he&rsquo;s besotted with her,
the poor fool. And she with him, for all the good it will do him. I
don&rsquo;t think he would even look twice at another woman, but she
doesn&rsquo;t believe it, not if the other woman looks first anyway.
He&rsquo;s found his falcon, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if she
kills him when the hawk appears.&rdquo; Her breath caught, and she
glanced up at him again then busied herself drinking from the
goblet.</p>

<p>She would tell him what she meant if he asked. He
remembered her as saying nothing of her viewings unless they
concerned him, but if that was so, she had changed for some reason.
She would view anyone he asked now, and tell him everything she
saw. Yet doing so made her uncomfortable.</p>

<p><em>Shut up!</em> he shouted at Lews Therin. <em>Go
away! You&rsquo;re dead!</em> It had no effect; it often did not,
now. That voice went on mumbling, maybe about being betrayed by
friends, maybe about betraying them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see anything that concerns me?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>With a grateful grin, Min settled companionably
against his chest&mdash;well, she probably meant it to be
companionable; or then again, very likely not&mdash;and began
talking between sips of punch. &ldquo;When you two were together, I saw
those fireflies and the darkness stronger than ever. Um. I like
melon punch. But with the two of you in the same room, the
fireflies were holding their own instead of being eaten faster than
they can swarm, the way they do when you&rsquo;re alone. And
something else I saw when you were together. Twice he&rsquo;s going
to have to be there, or you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; She peered into her goblet so
he could not see her face. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s not, something bad will
happen to you.&rdquo; Her voice sounded small and frightened. &ldquo;Very
bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Much as he would have liked to know more&mdash;like
when and where and what&mdash;she would have told him already had
she known. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll just have to keep him around,&rdquo; he said,
as cheerfully as he could. He did not like for Min to be
frightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that that will be enough,&rdquo; she
mumbled into her punch. &ldquo;It <em>will</em> happen if he is not
there, but nothing I saw said it won&rsquo;t because he is. It will
be very bad, Rand. Just thinking of that viewing makes me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned her face up, and was surprised to see tears
leaking from her eyes. &ldquo;Min, I didn&rsquo;t know these viewings
could hurt you,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;I am sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fat lot you know, sheepherder,&rdquo; she muttered.
Plucking a lace-edged handkerchief from her sleeve, she dabbed at
her eyes. &ldquo;It was just dust. You don&rsquo;t make Sulin dust in here
often enough.&rdquo; The handkerchief went back with a flourish. &ldquo;I
should go back to The Crown of Roses. I just had to tell you what I
saw about Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Min, be careful. Maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t come so
often. I can&rsquo;t think Merana would be easy on you if she
discovered what you are doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her grin looked very much her old self, and her eyes
looked amused even if they did still shine from the tears. &ldquo;You let
me worry about me, sheepherder. They think I am gawking at the
sights of Caemlyn like every other country simpleton. If I
didn&rsquo;t come every day, would you know they are meeting with
the nobles?&rdquo; She had glimpsed that by chance on her way to the
Palace yesterday, Merana appearing for an instant at the window of
a palace Min had learned belonged to Lord Pelivar. There was as
much chance that Pelivar and his guests were the only ones as there
was that Merana had gone to clear Pelivar&rsquo;s drains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You be careful,&rdquo; he told her firmly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want you hurt, Min.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment she studied him silently, then rose up
enough to kiss him lightly on the lips. At least&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, it was
light, but this was a daily ritual when she left, and he thought
maybe those kisses were getting a little less light every day.</p>

<p>Despite all his promises to himself, he said, &ldquo;I wish
you wouldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo; Letting her sit on his knee was one
thing, but kisses were carrying the joke too far.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No tears yet, farmboy,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;No stammer.&rdquo;
Ruffling his hair as if he were ten, she walked to the door, but as
she sometimes did, she moved in a gracefully swaying fashion that
might not have produced tears and stammer but certainly did make
him stare however hard he tried not to. His eyes whipped to her
face as she turned around. &ldquo;Why, sheepherder, your face is flushed.
I thought the heat never touched you now. Never mind. I wanted to
tell you, I will be careful. I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow. Be sure to
put on clean stockings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rand let out a long breath once the door was firmly
shut behind her. Clean stockings? He put on clean every day! There
were only two choices. He could keep pretending she was having no
effect until she quit, or he could resign himself to stammering. Or
maybe to begging; she might stop if he begged, but then she would
have that to tease him with, and Min did like teasing. The only
other option&mdash;keeping their time together short; being cold
and distant&mdash;was out of the question. She was a friend; he
could as well have been cold toward&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Aviendha and Elayne were
the names that came to mind, and they did not fit. Toward Mat or
Perrin. The only thing he did not understand was why he still felt
so comfortable around her. He should not, with her taunting him in
this way, but he did.</p>

<p>Lews Therin&rsquo;s maundering had grown louder from
the moment the Aes Sedai were mentioned, and now he said quite
clearly, <em>If they are plotting with the nobles, I have to do
something about them</em>.</p>

<p><em>Go away</em>, Rand commanded.</p>

<p><em>Nine are too dangerous, even untrained. Too
dangerous. Can&rsquo;t allow them. No. Oh, no</em>.</p>

<p><em>Go away, Lews Therin!</em></p>

<p><em>I am not dead!</em> the voice howled. <em>I
deserve death, but I am alive! Alive! Alive!</em></p>

<p><em>You are dead!</em> Rand shouted back in his head.
<em>You are dead, Lews Therin!</em></p>

<p>The voice dwindled, still howling <em>Alive!</em>
when it faded from hearing.</p>

<p>Shaking, Rand got up and refilled his goblet,
draining the punch in one long swallow. Sweat dripped from his
face, and his shirt clung to him. Finding the concentration again
was an effort. Lews Therin was growing more persistent. One thing
was certain. If Merana was plotting with the nobles, especially the
nobles ready to declare rebellion if he did not produce Elayne soon
enough to satisfy them, then he did have to do something.
Unfortunately, he had no idea what.</p>

<p><em>Kill them</em>, Lews Therin whispered. <em>Nine
are too dangerous, but if I kill some, if I chase them away</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>kill them</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>make them fear me</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<em>I
will not die again</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>I deserve death, but I want to live</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;he
began to weep, but the whispered rambling continued.</p>

<p>Rand filled his goblet again and tried not to
listen.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">When the Origan Gate into the Inner City came into
sight, Demira Eriff slowed. A number of men in the crowded street
eyed her admiringly as they squeezed past, and for perhaps the
thousandth time she made a note to stop wearing dresses from her
native Arad Doman, and for the thousandth time promptly forgot it.
Dresses were hardly important&mdash;she had been having the same
six duplicated for years&mdash;and if a man who did not realize
she was Aes Sedai became too impudent, it was always a simple
matter to let him know who he was being saucy to. That got them out
of her hair quickly enough, usually as fast as they could run.</p>

<p>Right then all she was interested in was the Origan
Gate, a great white marble arch in the gleaming white wall, the
stream of people, carts and wagons passing through it watched by a
dozen Aielmen she suspected were not so desultory as they appeared
at first glance. They might recognize an Aes Sedai on sight.
Surprising people did sometimes. Besides, she had been followed
from The Crown of Roses; those coats and breeches made to fade into
rock and brush stood out on a city street. So even had she wanted
to enter the Inner City, even had she been willing to risk
Merana&rsquo;s wrath by entering without first asking
al&rsquo;Thor&rsquo;s permission, she would not have. How that did
gall, Aes Sedai being required to ask a man&rsquo;s <em>permission</em>. All
she wanted was a sight of one Milam Harnder, Second Librarian in
the Royal Palace, and her agent for nearly thirty years.</p>

<p>The library in the Palace here could not compare with
that in the White Tower, or the Royal Library in Cairhien, or the
Terhana Library in Bandar Eban, but she might as well wish to fly
as for access to one of those. Still, if her message had reached
Milam, he would have begun searching for the books she wanted. The
Palace library might well have some information about the Seals on
the Dark One&rsquo;s prison, perhaps even cataloged sources, though
that might be too much to hope. Most libraries had volumes lying in
corners that should have been recorded long ago yet somehow had
remained forgotten for a hundred years, or five hundred, sometimes
even more. Most libraries held treasures even the librarians did
not suspect.</p>

<p>She waited patiently, letting the crowd flow by her,
attending only to the people coming out of the gate, but she did
not see Milam&rsquo;s bald head and round face. At last she sighed.
Plainly he had not received her message; if he had, he would have
made whatever excuse was necessary to be there at the appointed
time. She was going to have to wait on her turn to accompany Merana
to the Palace and hope young al&rsquo;Thor would give her permission&mdash;permission again!&mdash;to search in the library.</p>

<p>Turning away from the gate, her eyes chanced to meet
those of a tall, lean-faced fellow in a carter&rsquo;s vest who was
gazing at her much too admiringly. When their eyes met, he
winked!</p>

<p>She was not going to put up with that all the way
back to the inn. <em>I really must remember to have some plain
dresses made</em>, she thought, wondering why she had never done it
before. Luckily, she had been in Caemlyn before, some years ago,
and Stevan would be waiting at The Crown of Roses, a beacon she
could use to guide her if it came to that. She slipped into the
narrow shaded gap between a cutler&rsquo;s shop and a tavern.</p>

<p>The narrow alleyways of Caemlyn had been muddy the
last time she was in them, but even dry, the deeper she went, the
more unfortunate the smell. The walls were blank, with never a
window and seldom a cramped door or narrow gate, and those with the
look of not having been open in a long time. Scrawny cats peered at
her silently from atop barrels and back walls, and stray dogs with
knobby ribs laid back their ears, sometimes growling before they
skulked off down a crossing run, as alleys were called here. She
felt no worry about being scratched or bitten. Cats seemed to sense
something about Aes Sedai; she had never heard of an Aes Sedai
being scratched by even the most feral cat. Dogs were hostile,
true, almost as if they thought Aes Sedai were cats, but they
almost always slinked away after a little show.</p>

<p>There were far more dogs and cats in the runs than
she remembered, and gaunter, but many fewer people. She had not
seen anyone at all before she rounded a corner to find five or six
Aielmen coming toward her, laughing and talking among themselves.
They seemed startled to see her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon, Aes Sedai,&rdquo; one of them muttered, and they
all pressed against the side of the run, though there was plenty of
room.</p>

<p>Wondering if they were the same who had followed her&mdash;one of those faces looked familiar, that of a squat fellow
with villainous eyes&mdash;she nodded and murmured thanks as she
started past.</p>

<p>The spear going into her side was such a shock she
did not even cry out. Frantically she reached for <em>saidar</em>,
but something else pierced her side, and she was down in the dust.
That remembered face was thrust into hers, black eyes mocking,
growling something she ignored as she tried to reach <em>
saidar</em>, tried to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;darkness closed in.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">When Perrin and Faile finally left the interminable
interview with her parents, that odd serving woman, Sulin, was
waiting for them in the hallway. Sweat drenched Perrin, making dark
patches on his coat, and he felt as if he had run ten miles while
being pummeled every stride. Faile had a smile on her face and a
spring in her step; she looked radiant, beautiful, and as proud of
herself as when she brought the Watch Hill men just as the Trollocs
were about to overrun Emond&rsquo;s Field. Sulin curtsied every time
one of them looked at her, nearly falling over every single time;
that leathery face with its scar down her cheek was fixed in an
obsequious smile that seemed ready to shatter at a breath. Passing
Maidens flashed handtalk at one another, and Sulin curtsied to them
as well, though grinding her teeth loud enough for Perrin to hear
clearly. Even Faile began to eye her warily.</p>

<p>Once the woman led them to their rooms, a sitting
room and a bedchamber with a canopied bed big enough for ten and a
long marble balcony overlooking a fountained courtyard, she
insisted on explaining or showing them everything, even what they
could see. Their horses had been stabled and curried. Their
saddlebags were unpacked and hung in the wardrobe with
Perrin&rsquo;s axe belt, most of the scant contents laid in the
drawers of a chest-on-chest in a precise array. Perrin&rsquo;s axe
was propped beside the gray marble fireplace as though to chop
kindling. One of the two silver pitchers glistening with
condensation held cool tea flavored with mint, the other plum
punch. Two gilt-framed mirrors on the wall were pointed out and
touched, one over a table where Faile&rsquo;s ivory comb and brush
were laid, and a great stand-mirror with carved uprights that a
blind man could not have missed.</p>

<p>While Sulin was still explaining about bath water
being brought, and copper tubs, Perrin pressed a gold crown into
her callused palm. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but if you will leave us
now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; For a moment he thought she was going to throw the fat
coin at him, but instead he got another wavering curtsy and a
slammed door as she departed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose whoever trains the servants doesn&rsquo;t
know her job,&rdquo; Faile said. &ldquo;That was very good, by the way. Polite
but firm. If you would only do that with <em>our</em> servants.&rdquo; As
she turned her slim back, her voice dropped to a murmur. &ldquo;Will you
unbutton me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He always felt very thick-fingered undoing her small
buttons, half-afraid he was going to pop them off or tear her
dress. On the other hand, he did enjoy undressing his wife. She
usually had a maid do it, because of lost buttons he was sure. &ldquo;Did
you mean any of that nonsense you told your mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you not tamed me, my husband,&rdquo; she said without
looking at him, &ldquo;and taught me to perch on your wrist when you
call? Do I not run to please you? Am I not obedient to your
smallest gesture?&rdquo; She smelled amused. She certainly sounded
amused. The only thing was, she sounded as if she meant it, too,
the same as when she told her mother practically the same thing,
head high and as proud as she could be. Women were strange, that
was all there was to it. And her mother&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! For that matter,
her father!</p>

<p>Maybe he should change the subject. What was that
Bashere had mentioned? &ldquo;Faile, what is a broken crown?&rdquo; He was sure
that had been it.</p>

<p>She made a vexed noise, and suddenly began to smell
upset. &ldquo;Rand is gone from the Palace, Perrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if he is?&rdquo; Bending to peer at a tiny
mother-of-pearl button, he frowned at her back. &ldquo;How do you
know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Maidens. Bain and Chiad taught me some of their
handtalk. Don&rsquo;t let on, Perrin. From the way they behaved when
they heard there were Aiel here, I think maybe they shouldn&rsquo;t
have. Besides, it might be good to understand what the Maidens are
saying without them knowing it. They seem thick around Rand.&rdquo; She
twisted around to give him a roguish look and stroke his beard.
 &ldquo;Those first Maidens we met thought you have nice shoulders, but
they did not think much of this. Aiel women do not know a good
beard when they see one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shaking his head, he waited until she turned again,
then pocketed the button that had come off when she twisted. Maybe
she would not notice; he had gone a week with a button missing from
his coat, and had not known until she pointed it out. As for
beards, from what Gaul said, Aiel always shaved clean; Bain and
Chiad had thought his beard a subject for odd jokes. He had thought
of shaving himself more than once in this heat. But Faile did like
the beard. &ldquo;What about Rand? Why should it matter if he&rsquo;s left
the Palace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just that you should know what he&rsquo;s doing
behind your back. Obviously you didn&rsquo;t know he was going off.
Remember, he is the Dragon Reborn. That is very like a king, a king
of kings, and kings sometimes use up even friends, by accident and
on purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rand wouldn&rsquo;t do that. What are you suggesting,
anyway? That I spy on him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He meant it as a joke, but she said, &ldquo;Not you, my
love. Spying is a wife&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faile!&rdquo; Straightening so fast he nearly yanked
another button loose, he took her shoulders and turned her to face
him. &ldquo;You are not going to spy on Rand, do you hear me?&rdquo; She put on
a dogged look, mouth drawing down, eyes narrowing&mdash;she
practically reeked of stubbornness&mdash;but he could be dogged,
too. &ldquo;Faile, I want to see some of that obedience you were boasting
about.&rdquo; As far as he could see, she did what he said when she good
and well pleased and otherwise not, and forget whether he was in
the right or not. &ldquo;I mean it, Faile. I want your promise. I&rsquo;ll
be no part of anyb&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise, my heart,&rdquo; she said, placing her fingers
over his mouth. &ldquo;I promise I will not spy on Rand. You see, I am
obedient to my lord husband. Do you remember how many grandchildren
my mother said she expects?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sudden change of direction made him blink. But
she had promised; that was the important thing. &ldquo;Six, I think. I
lost count when she started telling us which were to be boys and
which girls.&rdquo; Lady Deira had had some startlingly frank advice on
how this was to be achieved; thankfully he had missed most of it
from wondering whether he should leave the room till she finished.
Faile had just nodded away as though it was the most natural thing
in the world, with her husband and her father there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least six,&rdquo; she said with a truly wicked grin.
 &ldquo;Perrin, she will be looking over our shoulders unless I can tell
her she can expect the first soon, and I thought, if you ever
managed to undo the rest of my buttons&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; After months of
marriage she still blushed, but that grin never faded. &ldquo;The
presence of a real bed after so many weeks makes me forward as a
farmgirl at harvest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes he wondered about these Saldaean farmgirls
she was always bringing up. Blushes or no blushes, if they were as
forward as Faile when he and she were alone, no crops would ever be
harvested in Saldaea. He broke off two more buttons getting her
dress undone, and she did not mind a bit. She actually managed to
tear his shirt.</p>

<br>

<p class="drop">Demira was surprised to open her eyes, surprised to
find herself lying on the bed in her own room in The Crown of
Roses. She expected to be dead, not undressed and tucked under a
linen sheet. Stevan was sitting on a stool at the foot of her bed,
managing to look relieved, concerned and stern all at the same
time. Her slender Cairhienin Warder was a head shorter than she and
nearly twenty years younger for all the gray streaking his temples,
but sometimes he tried to behave like a father, all but claiming
she could not take care of herself without him holding her hand.
She very much feared this incident would give him the high ground
in that struggle for months to come. Merana was on one side of the
bed looking grave, Berenicia on the other. The plump Yellow sister
always looked grave, but now she looked absolutely somber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Demira managed. Light, but she felt weak.
Healing did that, but putting her arms outside the sheet was an
effort. She must have been very close to death. Healing left no
scars, but memories and weakness were quite enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man came into the common room,&rdquo; Stevan said,
 &ldquo;claiming he wanted some ale. He said he had seen Aiel following an
Aes Sedai&mdash;he described you exactly&mdash;and saying they
were going to kill her. As soon as he spoke, I felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; He
grimaced bleakly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stevan asked me to come,&rdquo; Berenicia said, &ldquo;he all
but dragged me&mdash;and we ran the whole way. Truth, I was not
certain we were in time until you opened your eyes just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Merana said in a flat voice, &ldquo;it was all
part of the same trap, the same warning. The Aiel and the man. A
pity we let him get away, but we were so concerned over you that he
managed to slip off before anyone thought to hold him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Demira had been thinking about Milam and how this was
going to affect the search in the library, about how long it was
going to take Stevan to calm down, and what Merana was saying did
not really penetrate until the last. &ldquo;Hold him? A warning? What are
you talking about, Merana?&rdquo; Berenicia muttered something about her
understanding if they showed it to her in a book; Berenicia had an
acid tongue at times.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen anyone come into the common room for a
drink since we arrived, Demira?&rdquo; Merana asked patiently.</p>

<p>It was true; she had not. One or even two Aes Sedai
made little difference to an inn&rsquo;s custom in Caemlyn, but nine
was another matter. Mistress Cinchonine had remarked on it openly
of late. &ldquo;Then it was intended you should know Aiel had killed me.
Or maybe that I was to be found before I died.&rdquo; She had just
recalled what that villainous-faced fellow had growled at her. &ldquo;I
was told to tell you all to stay away from al&rsquo;Thor. Exact
words. &lsquo;Tell the other witches to stay away from the Dragon
Reborn.&rsquo; I could hardly deliver that message dead, could I?
How were my wounds placed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stevan shifted on his stool, darting a pained look at
her. &ldquo;Both missed any organ that would have killed you on the spot,
but the amount of blood you lost&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we to do now?&rdquo; Demira cut in, directing her
question to Merana, before he could start in on how foolish she had
been to let herself be caught that way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say we should find the Aiel responsible,&rdquo;
Berenicia said firmly, &ldquo;and make an example of them.&rdquo; She came from
the Border Marches of Shienar, and Aiel raids had been a feature of
her growing up. &ldquo;Seonid agrees with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; Demira protested. &ldquo;I will not have my first
chance to study the Aiel ruined. They&rsquo;ll hardly say two words
as it is. It was my blood, after all. Besides, unless the man who
gave you warning was Aiel too, it seems obvious to me that they
acted under orders, and I think there is only one man in Caemlyn
who orders Aiel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rest of us,&rdquo; Merana said, eyeing Berenicia
firmly, &ldquo;agree with you, Demira. I want to hear no more talk of
wasting time and energy finding one pack of hounds among hundreds
while the man who set them to hunt walks about grinning.&rdquo; Berenicia
bristled a little before bowing her head, but she always did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must at least show al&rsquo;Thor he cannot treat
Aes Sedai in this fashion,&rdquo; Berenicia said sharply. A glance from
Merana moderated her tone, though she did not sound happy. &ldquo;Yet not
so sharply that it ruins everything we&rsquo;ve planned, of
course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Demira steepled her fingers against her lips and
sighed. She did feel weak. &ldquo;A thought occurs to me. If we charge
him openly with what he&rsquo;s done, he will deny it, of course,
and we have no proof to fling in his face. Not only that, it might
be wise to let it be learned that he feels free to hunt Aes Sedai
like rabbits.&rdquo; Merana and Berenicia exchanged glances and nodded
quite firmly. Poor Stevan frowned furiously; he had never let
anyone walk away from hurting her. &ldquo;Might it not be better to say
nothing? That will certainly make him ponder and sweat. Why
haven&rsquo;t we said anything? What are we going to do? I
don&rsquo;t know how much we can do, but we can at least make him
look over his shoulder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A valid point,&rdquo; Verin said from the doorway.
 &ldquo;Al&rsquo;Thor has to respect Aes Sedai, or there will be no working
with him.&rdquo; She motioned Stevan to leave&mdash;he waited for
Demira&rsquo;s nod, of course&mdash;then took his stool. &ldquo;I thought
since you were the target&mdash;&rdquo; She frowned at Merana and
Berenicia. &ldquo;Will you sit down? I do not mean to get a crick in my
neck staring up at you.&rdquo; Verin went on while they were still
placing the room&rsquo;s only chair and a second stool beside the
bed. &ldquo;Since you were the target, Demira, you should help decide how
Master al&rsquo;Thor is to be taught his lesson. And you seem to
have made a beginning already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I think,&rdquo; Merana began, but Verin cut her
off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a moment, Merana. Demira has the right to first
suggestions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Demira&rsquo;s breath caught as she waited for the
explosion. Merana always seemed to want her decisions approved by
Verin, which was natural enough under the circumstances, if
awkward, but this was the first time Verin had simply taken charge.
In front of others, at least. Yet all Merana did was stare at Verin
for a moment, lips compressed, and then bow her head. Demira
wondered whether this meant Merana was going to resign the embassy
to Verin; there did not seem anything else she could do, now. All
eyes turned to Demira, waiting. Verin&rsquo;s were particularly
penetrating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we want him to worry over what we intend to do, I
suggest no one go to the Palace today. Perhaps without any
explanation, or if that is too strong, with one he must see
through.&rdquo; Merana nodded. More importantly, as things were turning
out, Verin did as well. Demira decided to venture a little more.
 &ldquo;Maybe we should send no one for several days, to let him stew.
I&rsquo;m sure watching Min will tell us when he is nicely on the
boil, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rdquo; Whatever they decided to do, she wanted to be
part of it. It had been her blood, after all, and the Light only
knew how long she would have to put off her researches in the
library now. That last was almost as much reason to teach
al&rsquo;Thor a lesson as his forgetting who Aes Sedai were.</p>
