          After about 15 years of being gone, smcrossover is once again back! We are currently
          rebuilding a brand new site from scratch, we're not really sure what all will be here when
          we relaunch. The site was once the home of crossover fanfiction stories, particularly
          featuring the Sailor Moon anime series. So sit back and relax, we'll be back with a brand
          new look and feel in no time flat.
