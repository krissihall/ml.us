  <div class="header">History</div>
  <div class="body">This is the second time around for a combined site. Both of us have discovered that we don't have time for an graphics site on our own, so we decided to again join forces and make a joint site. The first time we had a joined site, it was called 'Icy Waters' to those that remember. Then we both had separate sites. Chris's site was called Rabellu and was widely known. Pokahydee's site was called Crystalline Illusions and was known a little bit as well. Chris took down Rabellu and combined her graphics into her domain serene-desires.net and Pokahydee combined Crystalline Illusions into her domain mysticallegends.com. Now several years later, we're giving a combined site a second chance.</div>

  <div class="body">Below are screenshots of our previous/retired layouts for the site. The site is skinned so there are multiple layouts to choose from when you visit, but occasionally, we decide that one of them has been on display for long enough and we retire it.</div>
