Hm, there's not really much to say about me. My main interest and love is computers and tinkering with them. But I've been 
interested in web design and graphics since I was in highschool. I've been doing it for about six years now, and I don't 
think it'll ever stop ^^. I'm very confortable with working in photoshop, but I do have my weakpoints. I wish to someday 
work comfortably in illustrator and other programs in the adobe suite.
<p>
As for programming languages, I'm very comfortable with with advanced html and css, and I am also familiar with working 
with mysql and php. I do need to learn more about those two languages though. </div>

I have been improving my website building skills over the years and now use heavy CSS with a basic XHTML structure. I use divs heavily as well and really enjoy coding and working in Photoshop. I'm currently attending college as a Multimedia major. In my program, we learn website design and coding, PHP, MySQL, Flash, 3D Modeling and Animating, Audio and Video Editting, as well as print work. We are learning 3D Studio Max 9, Adobe Premier, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Dreamweaver, Adobe Flash, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Audition and much more.</div>
